We have studied fibroblast cultures obtained from three patients with MCAD deficiency by sequencing the entire coding region of MCAD mRNA. A single A to G nucleotide replacement which resulted in lysine329-to-glutamic acid329 substitution of the MCAD protein was identified in all cultures. Furthermore, this point mutation was present in 91% (31 of 34) of mutant MCAD alleles, indicating that the majority of cases with MCAD deficiency are caused by this type of mutation.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
