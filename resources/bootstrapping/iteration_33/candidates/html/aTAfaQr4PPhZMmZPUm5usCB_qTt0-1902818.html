Demonstration of intra-mitochondrial mature MCAD indistinguishable in size (42.5-kDa) from control MCAD, and of mRNA with the correct size of 2.4 kb, indicated a point-mutation in the coding region of the MCAD gene to be disease-causing. Consequently, cloning and DNA sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified complementary DNA (cDNA) from messenger RNA of fibroblasts from the patient and family members were performed. All clones sequenced from the patient exhibited a single base substitution from adenine (A) to guanine (G) at position 985 in the MCAD cDNA as the only consistent base-variation compared with control cDNA. In contrast, the parents contained cDNA with the normal and the mutated sequence, revealing their obligate carrier status. Allelic homozygosity in the patient and heterozygosity for the mutation in the parents were established by a modified PCR reaction, introducing a cleavage site for the restriction endonuclease NcoI into amplified genomic DNA containing G985. The same assay consistently revealed A985 in genomic DNA from 26 control individuals. The A to G mutation was introduced into an E. coli expression vector producing mutant MCAD, which was demonstrated to be inactive, probably because of the inability to form active tetrameric MCAD. All the experiments are consistent with the contention that the G985 mutation, resulting in a lysine to glutamate shift at position 329 in the MCAD polypeptide chain, is the genetic cause of MCAD deficiency in this family. We found the same mutation in homozygous form in 11 out of 12 other patients with verified MCAD deficiency.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
