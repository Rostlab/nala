We found that expression of the HCM-causing cardiac MHC gene (Myh6) R403Q mutation in mice can be selectively silenced by an RNA interference (RNAi) cassette delivered by an adeno-associated virus vector. RNAi-transduced MHC(403/+) mice developed neither hypertrophy nor myocardial fibrosis, the pathologic manifestations of HCM, for at least 6 months. Because inhibition of HCM was achieved by only a 25% reduction in the levels of the mutant transcripts, we suggest that the variable clinical phenotype in HCM patients reflects allele-specific expression and that partial silencing of mutant transcripts may have therapeutic benefit.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
