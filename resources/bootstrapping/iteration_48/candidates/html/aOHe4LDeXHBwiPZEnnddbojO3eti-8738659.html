This 45-year-old man developed moderate proteinuria and was diagnosed with Fabry disease on the basis of renal histologic findings and prominent decreases in alpha-GAL A activity in his plasma, urine, leukocytes, and skin fibroblasts. Determination of the cDNA sequence of his alpha-GAL A gene revealed substitution of a G to A in codon 301, resulting in a glutamine rather than an arginine residue. Our case is unique in that this patient only demonstrated renal manifestations while all other reported patients with atypical Fabry disease, including a case with the identical point mutation, present with a cardiomyopathy. Direct DNA sequencing of exon 6 and measurement of alpha-GAL A activity among the patient's family confirmed that the mutation was transmitted from his mother.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
