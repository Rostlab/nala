This variant ACT was a point mutation of exon V of ACT, with the substitution of Met by Val. Four out of six individuals with this variant ACT had occlusive-cerebrovascular disease, leading to one hypothesis that there might be an association between this mutation and occlusive-cerebrovascular disease.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
