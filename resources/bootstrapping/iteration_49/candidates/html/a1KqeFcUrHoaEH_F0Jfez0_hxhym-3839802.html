We sought to define, at a molecular level, the mutations responsible for ADA deficiency in the cell line GM-1715, derived from an immunodeficient patient. Full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) for ADA was synthesized and cloned from the cell line. Sequence analysis of the clones revealed a point mutation in codon 101 (CGG to CAG) that predicts an amino acid change from arginine to glutamine. Southern blot analysis, based on silent polymorphisms in the cDNA sequence, indicated that only one of the defective alleles of the GM-1715 line had been sequenced. The mutation that was identified appears to be responsible for the loss of function in this allele, since the predicted primary structure of the enzyme is otherwise entirely normal.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
