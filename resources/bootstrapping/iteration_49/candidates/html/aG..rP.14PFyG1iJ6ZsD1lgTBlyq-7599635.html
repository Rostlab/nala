When expressed in vitro, the H15D, A83D, and A179D proteins lacked detectable ADA activity. The splicing defect caused skipping of exon 5, resulting in premature termination of translation and a reduced level of mRNA. H15D is the first naturally occurring mutation of a residue that coordinates directly with the enzyme-associated zinc ion. Molecular modeling based on the atomic coordinates of murine ADA suggests that the D15 mutation would create a cavity or gap between the zinc ion and the side chain carboxylate of D15. This could alter the ability of zinc to activate a water molecule postulated to play a role in the catalytic mechanism. A83 and A179 are not directly involved in the active site, but are conserved residues located respectively in alpha helix 4 and beta strand 4 of the alpha/beta barrel. Replacement of these small hydrophobic Ala residues with the charged, more bulky Asp side chain may distort ADA structure and affect enzyme stability or folding.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
