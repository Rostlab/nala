USF2 is a member of the bHLH-Zip protein family, possessing a basic (b) DNA binding region, a helix-loop-helix (HLH) motif, and a leucine zipper (Zip) structure. Mutants of USF2 that lacked a Zip formed heterodimers with c-Maf, but did not homodimerize. Deletion of the USF2 basic region or mutation of its helices abrogated its binding to c-Maf, but had no effect on homodimerization. A functional c-Maf bZip motif was necessary for both homodimerization and heterodimerization with USF2. These data suggest a tetrameric configuration for Maf-USF2 complexes. In the presence of USF2, the DNA binding activity of c-Maf was markedly reduced. Therefore, USF2 and c-Maf may interact to regulate gene expression.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
