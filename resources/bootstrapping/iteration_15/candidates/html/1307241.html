The majority of the 105 patients screened had definite or probable Alzheimer's disease, but we also included atypical cases and some chronic schizophrenics. We identified a single abnormal case--a chronic schizophrenic with cognitive defects. Sequencing revealed a C to T nucleotide substitution which produces an alanine to valine change at codon 713. We were unable to detect the mutation in the remaining members of the original cohort nor in a further 100 chronic schizophrenics and 100 non-demented controls. Nonetheless, the position of the mutation in a critical portion of the APP gene suggests that it may well prove to be pathogenic.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
