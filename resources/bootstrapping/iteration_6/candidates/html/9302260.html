Severely affected patients carry mutations in the CYB11B1 gene that destroy enzymatic activity. Such patients have signs of androgen excess and usually have hypertension. Mild or non-classic 11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency has been reported previously but not studied genetically. In this study we report analysis of the CYP11B1 genes of three patients thought to suffer from non-classic 11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency. Mutations were detected in the CYP11B1 genes of two patients. One was a compound heterozygote for missense mutations N133H and T319M, whereas the other carried a nonsense mutation (Y423X) on one allele and a missense mutation (P42S) on the other. All three missense mutations affected enzymatic activity when expressed in vitro. No mutations were detected in the coding regions or intron-exon boundaries of the CYP11B1 genes of the other putative non-classic patient. In addition, we were unable to detect CYP11B1 mutations in two hirsute women with mildly elevated levels of 11 beta-hydroxylase precursors who had previously been identified in a screening study of patients in a reproductive endocrinology clinic. We conclude that nonclassic 11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency is a rare disorder. It is not a significant cause of hyperandrogenism in women and relatively stringent criteria should be used to prevent its misdiagnosis.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
