These symptoms can be prevented or significantly attenuated by the oral administration of acetazolamide; however, the mechanism by which acetazolamide ameliorates EA2 symptoms is unknown. EA2 typically results from nonsense mutations in the CACNA1A gene that encodes the alpha1A (Cav2.1) subunit of the P/Q-type calcium (Ca2+) channel. We have identified a novel H1736L missense mutation in the CACNA1A gene associated with the EA2 phenotype. This mutation is localized near the pore-forming region of the P/Q-type Ca2+ channel. Functional analysis of P/Q-type channels containing the mutation show that the H1736L alteration affects several channel properties, including reduced current density, increased rate of inactivation, and a shift in the voltage dependence of activation to more positive values. Although these findings are consistent with an overall loss of P/Q-type channel function, the mutation also caused some biophysical changes consistent with a gain of function. We also tested the direct effect of acetazolamide on both wild-type and H1736L mutated P/Q-type channels and did not observe any direct action on channel properties of this pharmacological agent used to treat EA2 patients.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
