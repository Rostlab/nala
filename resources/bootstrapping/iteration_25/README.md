Annotated by jmcejuela

Deleted two candidates since they didn't have any mention.
Furthermore, I accepted one document that I reviewed to not have mutation mentions
but where I removed a nice false positive.

I was also not sured about the annotations in:

"attached to a serine residue 16 amino acids upstream of the amino terminus of the A beta sequence of APP. The attachment of a glycosaminoglycan chain close to the A beta sequence"

I considered the attachments as insertions and therefore as positive mutations.
