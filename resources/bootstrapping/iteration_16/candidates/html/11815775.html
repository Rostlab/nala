Liver complementary DNA sequencing was performed in 7 infants for mutation analyses of FIC1 and BSEP genes. Two distinct liver histologic features were found. Group 1 (n = 5) was characterized by bland cholestasis and group 2 (n = 8) by giant cell transformation. Group 2 patients were associated with higher transaminase levels, alpha-fetoprotein levels, and early mortality. Novel FIC1 mutations were found in all 4 patients tested in group 1, including a 74-bp deletion, a 98-bp deletion, a nonsense, and 2 missense mutations. BSEP mutations were found in 2 of the 3 patients in group 2, including 2 missense mutations and a 1-bp deletion. Phenotypic characterization is useful to differentiate FIC1- from BSEP-related disease.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
