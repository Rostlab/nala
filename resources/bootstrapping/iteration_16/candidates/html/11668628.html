In this paper we describe three novel mutations causing sitosterolemia: 1) a frameshift mutation (c.336-337insA) in ABCG5 that results in premature termination of the protein at amino acid 197; 2) a missense mutation that changes a conserved residue c.1311C&gt;G; N437K) in ABCG5 and 3) a splice site mutation in ABCG8 (IVS1-2A&gt;G). This study expands the spectrum of the ABCG5 and ABCG8 mutations that cause sitosterolemia. Nine nonsynonymous polymorphisms are also reported: I523V, C600Y, Q604E, and M622V in ABCG5; and D19H, Y54C, T400K, A632V, and Y641F in ABCG8.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
