SLS has been reported to occur in many populations but the highest incidence is in the north of Sweden. The gene causing SLS encodes a fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH). In the present study, a point mutation in exon 7 of the FALDH gene was found in SLS patients of northern Swedish origin. The mutation consists of a C-to-T exchange at nucleotide position 943 in the cDNA. As a consequence, a highly conserved proline is replaced by a serine. The mutation was found in 49 out of 58 affected chromosomes and could be the most widely spread SLS mutation in the world.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
