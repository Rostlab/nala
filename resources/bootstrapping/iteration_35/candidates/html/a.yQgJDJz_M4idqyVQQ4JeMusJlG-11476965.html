We here report novel mutations in the ABCA1 gene in two sisters from a Japanese family with TD who have been described previously (S. Ohtaki, H. Nakagawa, N. Kida, H. Nakamura, K. Tsuda, S. Yokoyama, T. Yamamura, S. Tajima, A. Yamamoto, Atherosclerosis 49 (1983)) and a family with FHA. Both probands of TD and FHA developed coronary heart disease. Sequence analysis of the ABCA1 gene from the patients with TD revealed a homozygous G to A transition at nucleotide 3805 of the cDNA resulting in the substitution of Asp 1229 with Asn in exon 27, and a C to T at nucleotide 6181 resulting in the substitution of Arg 2021 with Trp in exon 47. Sequence analysis of the ABCA1 gene from the FHA patient revealed a homozygous 4 bp CGCC deletion from nucleotide 3787 to 3790 resulting in premature termination by frameshift at codon 1224. These mutations were confirmed by restriction digestion analysis, and were not found in 141 control subjects. Our findings indicate that mutations in the ABCA1 gene are associated with TD as well as FHA.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
