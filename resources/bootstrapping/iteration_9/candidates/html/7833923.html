We analyzed the structure of types I and II 3 beta-HSD genes in a male pseudohermaphrodite suffering from a severe salt-losing form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. We did not detect any mutation in the type I 3 beta-HSD gene, but we found two different missense mutations in exon IV of the type II 3 beta-HSD gene of the patient; a conversion of codon Leu108 into a Trp (L108W) inherited from his mother and a conversion of codon Pro186 into a Leu (P186L) inherited from his father. We assessed the effect of the L108W and P186L mutations on 3 beta-HSD activity by in vitro analysis of mutant enzymes expressed in heterologous COS-1 cells. Using homogenates from transfected cells, the Km values for PREG were 7 +/- 2 and 8 +/- 2 microM for the recombinant L108W and P186L enzymes, respectively, compared with 2.2 +/- 0.2 microM for the normal type II 3 beta-HSD enzyme. Moreover, Km values for NAD+ were much higher for the L108W and P186L proteins, being 678 +/- 166 and 920 +/- 351 microM, respectively, compared with 24 +/- 3 microM for the normal type II 3 beta-HSD enzyme. Vmax values for PREG and NAD+ were lower for both mutant enzymes; thus, the in vitro overall efficiency, relative to the normal enzyme, is approximate as 0.3% and 0.2% for the L108W and P186L enzymes, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</p></div></section></article></body></html>
