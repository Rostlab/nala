This substrate specificity for oxidized purine nucleoside triphosphates was investigated by mutation analyses based on the sequence comparison with the Escherichia coli homolog, MutT, which hydrolyzes only 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-rGTP but not oxidized forms of dATP or ATP. Neither a replacement of the phosphohydrolase module of MTH1 with that of MutT nor deletions of the C-terminal region of MTH1, which is unique for MTH1, altered the substrate specificity of MTH1. In contrast, the substitution of residues at position Trp-117 and Asp-119 of MTH1, which showed apparent chemical shift perturbations with 8-oxo-dGDP in NMR analyses but are not conserved in MutT, affected the substrate specificity. Trp-117 is essential for MTH1 to recognize both 8-oxo-dGTP and 2-hydroxy-dATP, whereas Asp-119 is only essential for recognizing 2-hydroxy-dATP, thus suggesting that origins of the substrate-binding pockets for MTH1 and MutT are different.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
