In this study the molecular basis of ORM1 polymorphism was investigated. For the detection of mutations the products of the six exons of each gene, amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), were screened by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. Subsequently, the exons with an altered migration pattern were gene-specifically amplified by nested PCR. Sequencing of the gene-specific PCR products showed that the three common ORM1 alleles result from A--&gt;G transitions at the codons for amino acid positions 20 in exon 1 and 156 in exon 5 of the AGP1 gene: ORM1*F1 was characterized by CAG (Gln) and GTG (Val), ORM1*F2, by CAG (Gln) and ATG (Met), and ORM1*S, by CGG (Arg) and GTG (Val). The phylogenesis of the genes encoding these three ORM1 alleles is discussed.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
