The mutations result in amino acid substitutions, Gly115----Ser and Ser-19----Leu, in the leader sequence, respectively, and have been designated Pi Null(Newport) and Pi Z Wrexham. In the two families studied the mutations occur on chromosomes which also carry the common mutation causing Z deficiency. Individuals with such a deficiency are, therefore, compound heterozygotes. It is not known if these particular mutations would only cause a mild form of AAT deficiency in the absence of the Z mutation as they do not appear to cause predictable folding abnormalities. They do, however, result in severe deficiency when the Z mutation occurs in the same gene.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
