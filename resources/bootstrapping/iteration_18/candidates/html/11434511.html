Since the alpha4 subunit (CHRNA4) is often found as a heteromer with the beta2 subunit (CHRNB2), alpha4 and beta2 cDNAs from the LS and SS mice were cloned and sequenced. A polymorphism in the coding portion of the alpha4 gene was found (1587A to G) which should result in a threonine/alanine substitution at position 529 (T529A). The LS and SS beta2 nicotinic receptor subunit cDNAs were identical. The potential consequences of the alpha4 polymorphism were evaluated using an ion (86Rb+) flux assay that likely measures the function of alpha4beta2-type receptors. LS-SS differences in maximal nicotine-stimulated ion flux were seen when bovine serum albumin (BSA) was not included but this difference was not seen when BSA was included in the perfusion buffer. Current evidence suggests that BSA may alter the ratio of nicotinic receptors that are in the ground state and desensitized forms. Thus, it may be that the Chrna4 T529A substitution leads to a difference in the ratio of the two receptor forms which then promotes differences in receptor function, as well as differential behavioural sensitivity to nicotine.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
