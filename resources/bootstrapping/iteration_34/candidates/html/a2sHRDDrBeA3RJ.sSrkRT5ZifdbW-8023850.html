Sixty-four probands were analyzed for mutations in the ASPA gene. Three point mutations--693C--&gt;A, 854A--&gt;C, and 914C--&gt;A--were identified in the coding sequence. The 693C--&gt;A and 914C--&gt;A base changes, resulting in nonsense tyr231--&gt;ter and missense ala305--&gt;glu mutations, respectively, lead to complete loss of ASPA activity in in vitro expression studies. The 854A--&gt;C transversion converted glu to ala in codon 285. The glu285--&gt;ala mutant ASPA has 2.5% of the activity expressed by the wild-type enzyme. A fourth mutation, 433 --2(A--&gt;G) transition, was identified at the splice-acceptor site in intron 2. The splice-site mutation would lead to skipping of exon 3, accompanied by a frameshift, and thus would produce aberrant ASPA. Of the 128 unrelated Canavan chromosomes analyzed, 88 were from probands of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. The glu285--&gt;ala mutation was predominant (82.9%) in this population, followed by the tyr231--&gt;ter (14.8%) and 433 --2(A--&gt;G) (1.1%) mutations. The three mutations account for 98.8% of the Canavan chromosomes of Ashkenazi Jewish origin. The ala305--&gt;glu mutation was found exclusively in non-Jewish probands of European descent and constituted 60% of the 40 mutant chromosomes. Predominant occurrence of certain mutations among Ashkenazi Jewish and non-Jewish patients with Canavan disease would suggest a founding-father effect in propagation of these mutant chromosomes.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
