Sequencing of the ACTA1 gene showed a "de novo" missense heterozygous mutation a&gt;g in exon 7 (Lys336Glu). Two-dimensional electrophoresis showed 28% mutant actin present in his muscle biopsy. Actin was isolated from the muscle biopsy and examined by in vitro motility assay. The sliding speed was 13+/-3% less than normal and the affinity of actin for the Z-line protein alpha-actinin was reduced 10 fold. This is the first report on a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated with nemaline myopathy and an ACTA1 mutation.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
