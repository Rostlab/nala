In vitro oxidation studies in cultured fibroblasts using 13C- and 14C-labeled branched chain amino acids indicated an isolated block in 2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (2-MBCDase). Western blotting revealed absence of 2-MBCDase protein in fibroblast extracts; DNA sequencing identified a single 778 C&gt;T substitution in the 2-MBCDase coding region (778 C&gt;T), substituting phenylalanine for leucine at amino acid 222 (L222F) and absence of enzyme activity for the 2-MBCDase protein expressed in Escherichia coli. Prenatal diagnosis in a subsequent pregnancy suggested an affected female fetus, supporting an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. These data confirm the first documented case of isolated 2-MBCDase deficiency in humans.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
