  "conserved Glu-165beta" is that enough? A=Y, P=Y, W=Y (before is "mutation of") but no target amino acid

* 1782566
  really interesting case, that we should definitely look at "[A29 (subtype) specifity was assigned to] L and Q amino-acids at position 62-63"
  !!! important
  "consensus HLA class I sequence (D102)"

* 12386153
  another interesting case with "all five cyt ... replaced by alanine" and "mutation of ... with consensus sequence"

* 8023850
  False Negative: "was identified at the splice-acceptor site in intron 2" (maybe intron/exon too much weight)  
  "lead to skipping of 3" is considered as mutation as well? --> didnt annotate

* 8659549
  "1- and 4-bp deletions [...]" together or separated and if separated without or with 1-? (without is the case now)

* 9499414
  "625A-1146T allele" should we consider this, as these are 2 point mutations appearing very often together
