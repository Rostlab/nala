We report here that replacing Glu residues at this position alters the ion selectivity of the human cardiac calcium channel. Substituting Glu334 in motif I or Glu1086 in motif III with Lys produced mutant calcium channels that permeated sodium ions 10-fold more effectively than barium ions. More conservative changes such as substitution of Glu1086 with Gln or substitution of Glu1387 with Ala also increased sodium permeation through the mutant calcium channels. Sodium currents through the mutant calcium channels could be modulated by dihydropyridines and blocked by external divalent cations. These results suggest that Glu334, Glu1086, and Glu1387 are part of a ring of glutamate residues formed in the pore-lining SS1-SS2 region and are critical in determining ion selectively and permeability of a human cardiac calcium channel.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
