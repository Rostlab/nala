(1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 8623-8627]. We constructed an Escherichia coli expression plasmid, pHAAD128G, which carries the mutant aldolase A [aldolase A(D-G)] cDNA, and the enzyme generated in E. coli transfected with the expression plasmid was purified and characterized. Conversion of Asp to Gly at the 128th position in the enzyme rendered the enzyme thermolabile and susceptible to tryptic digestion. CD spectra analysis also revealed that the mutant enzyme had a remarkable conformation change with a decrease of regular form in the molecule. Addition of glycerol or some other polyalcohols during thermal treatment protected this altered enzyme (but not the normal enzyme) against denaturation and activity decrease. In order to determine the function of the amino acid residue at the 128th position, two artificial mutant enzymes with the substitutions of Glu for Asp [aldolase A(D-E)] and Ser for Asp [aldolase A(D-S)], respectively, at the position were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and characterized. These analyses demonstrated the necessity for Asp to be present at the 128th residue in order for this enzyme to be thermally stable.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
