Sulfhydryl modification of ion channels is a proven approach for studying their structure-function relationships; here we examined the effects of the hydrophilic sulfhydryl-modifying agents methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium (MTSEA(+)) and methanethiosulfonate ethylsulfonate (MTSES(-)) on wild-type (WT) and engineered HCN1 channels. External application of MTSEA(+) to WT channels irreversibly reduced whole-cell currents (I(MTSEA)/I(Control) = 42 +/- 2%), slowed activation and deactivation kinetics ( approximately 7- and approximately 3-fold at -140 and -20 mV, respectively), and produced hyperpolarizing shifts of steady-state activation (V(12)((MTSEA)) = -125.8 +/- 9.0 mV versus V(12)((Control)) = -76.4 +/- 1.6 mV). Sequence inspection revealed the presence of five endogenous cysteines in the transmembrane domains of HCN1: three are putatively close to the extracellular milieu (Cys(303), Cys(318), and Cys(347) in the S5, S5-P, and P segments, respectively), whereas the remaining two are likely to be cytoplasmic or buried. To identify the molecular constituent(s) responsible for the effects of MTSEA(+), we mutated the three "external" cysteines individually to serine. C303S did not yield measurable currents. Whereas C347S channels remained sensitive to MTSEA(+), C318S was not modified (I(MTSEA)/I(Control) = 101 +/- 2%, V(12)((MTSEA)) = -78.4 +/- 1.1 mV, and V(12)((Control)) = -79.8 +/- 2.3 mV). Likewise, WT (but not C318S) channels were sensitive to MTSES(-). Despite their opposite charges, MTSES(-) produced changes directionally similar to those effected by MTSEA(+) (I(MTSES)/I(Control) = 22 +/- 1.6% and V(12)((MTSES)) = -145.9 +/- 4.9 mV). We conclude that S5-P Cys(318) of HCN1 is externally accessible and that the external pore vestibule and activation gating of HCN channels are allosterically coupled.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
