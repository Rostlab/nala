        <div class="content"><p id="s1p1">A new pathogenic mutation in the APP gene (I716V) increases the relative proportion of A beta 42(43).</p><p id="s1p2">We report a novel mutation in the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP I716V) which probably leads to familial early onset Alzheimer's disease with an onset age in the mid 50s. Cells transfected with cDNAs bearing this mutation produce more A beta 1-42(43) than those transfected with wild-type APP and this effect is additive with that of the previously reported APP V717I mutation thus providing a novel approach for further increasing A beta 1-42(43) in model systems.</p></div>
