[05/02/16 16:07:43] Juan Miguel Cejuela: a doc appears to have been selected without my consent in the iteration
[05/02/16 16:07:46] Juan Miguel Cejuela: can that happen?
[05/02/16 16:08:08] caschque: only if you have manually selected it before.
[05/02/16 16:08:27] caschque: you can delete the manual cache and then this shouldnt happen
[05/02/16 16:08:58] Juan Miguel Cejuela: ah; yes so I selected it manually in the last iteration and then deleted since I considered it false
[05/02/16 16:09:14] Juan Miguel Cejuela: ok, great to know
[05/02/16 16:10:04] Aleksandar Bojchevski: that's why you leave candidates in ... even if afterwards you decide they are not useful
[05/02/16 16:10:05] caschque: you can also just delete that specific doc from the manualdoccache. otherwise you ll have to select a lot of docuemnts again
[05/02/16 16:10:22] Aleksandar Bojchevski: for example I might have 11/12 or mroe candidates, but always 10 reviewed
[05/02/16 16:10:45] caschque: but ... how to add those 2 more documents?
[05/02/16 16:10:47] caschque: i mean ...
[05/02/16 16:11:06] Juan Miguel Cejuela: you didnâ€™t tell me that before ;)
[05/02/16 16:11:15] Juan Miguel Cejuela: OK, so from now on, delete the false docs in tagtog
[05/02/16 16:11:22] Juan Miguel Cejuela: but leave the candidates, and not write the reviewed
[05/02/16 16:11:24] caschque: ok
[05/02/16 16:11:26] Juan Miguel Cejuela: that will do, right?
[05/02/16 16:11:32] Aleksandar Bojchevski: doesn't happen often
[05/02/16 16:11:35] Aleksandar Bojchevski: yeah

[05/02/16 16:19:35] Juan Miguel Cejuela: Again, about the position, I am annotation mentions that do not have a position per se, but where the position is somwhere else in the text
[05/02/16 16:19:40] Juan Miguel Cejuela: I hope that agrees with the guideline
