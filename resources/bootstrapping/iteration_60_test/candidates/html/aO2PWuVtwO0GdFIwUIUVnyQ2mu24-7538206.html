The ion channel is formed by the second transmembrane domains (M2) of the four AChR subunits. We screened the genomic DNA of one family with the slow-channel syndrome for mutations in the coding sequences for the M2 domains of the four AChR subunits and report the identification of a missense mutation that causes a leucine-to-phenylalanine substitution at position 269 of the epsilon subunit in three affected members of a family with the slow-channel syndrome. We propose that this mutation may be responsible for the disease.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
