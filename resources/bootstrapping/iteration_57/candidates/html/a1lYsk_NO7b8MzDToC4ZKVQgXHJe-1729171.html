Serological studies have suggested the presence of a third member of this family HLA-A9.3, however there is doubt surrounding the existence of this specificity. HLA-A23, A24, and the putative A9.3 proteins were analyzed biochemically by immunoprecipitation and isoelectric focusing. Both HLA-A24 and A9.3 have identical isoelectric points whereas A23 is different. We have sequenced cDNA encoding HLA-A23, A24, and A9.3. From the observed protein sequences, we found A9.3 to differ from A24 by two amino acid substitutions located in the alpha 2 helix of the class I molecule. These substitutions are expected to significantly change the shape of the peptide binding cleft.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
