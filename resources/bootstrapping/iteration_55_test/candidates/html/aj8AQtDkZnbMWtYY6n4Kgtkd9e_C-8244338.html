The ALDH5 does not contain introns in the coding sequence for 517 amino acid residues. Within a short nucleotide region of the gene, the following three nucleotide changes were found in high frequencies, i.e., a silent C&lt;--&gt;T at nucleotide (nt) 183, C&lt;--&gt;T at nt 257 associated with a Val&lt;--&gt;Ala substitution, and T&lt;--&gt;G at nt 320 associated with a Arg&lt;--&gt;Leu substitution. The frequency of C at nt 183 is 81% in Caucasians and 65% in Japanese, and the difference is statistically not significant. The frequency of C at nt 257 is 76% in Caucasians and 55% in Japanese, and the difference is statistically significant (P = 0.02). The frequency of T at nt 320 is 71% in Caucasians, while it is only 27% in Japanese. The racial difference at nt 320 is highly significant (P &lt; 0.001). No significant difference was found in the genotypes of the three nucleotide positions between alcoholic and nonalcoholic Caucasians within the limited numbers of subjects examined.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
