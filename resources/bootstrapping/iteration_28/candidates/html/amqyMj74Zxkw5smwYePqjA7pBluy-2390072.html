Evaluation of alpha 1AT biosynthesis directed by the Wbethesda allele showed that although Wbethesda alpha 1AT mRNA was translated normally in vitro, transfection of the Wbethesda cDNA into COS-I cells was associated with human alpha 1AT secretion of 50% that of cells transfected with a normal alpha 1AT cDNA. The pattern of alpha 1AT biosynthesis was not intracellular accumulation as observed with the common Z alpha 1AT deficiency allele, but reduced intracellular alpha 1AT, suggesting intracellular degradation of the newly synthesized Wbethesda molecule. Together these observations suggest that in heterozygous combination with a Z or Null alpha 1AT allele, the Wbethesda variant causes "alpha 1AT deficiency", thus classifying it as an alpha 1AT "at risk" allele for emphysema.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
