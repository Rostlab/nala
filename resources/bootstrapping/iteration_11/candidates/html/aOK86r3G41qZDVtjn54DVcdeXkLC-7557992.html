Thus, it is important to identify polymorphisms and functional variants within this gene. Using SSCP analysis, we identified a Cys23-Ser23 substitution (designated 5-HT2Ccys and 5-HT2Cser) in the first hydrophobic region of the human 5-HT2C receptor. Allele frequencies in unrelated Caucasians were 0.13 and 0.87 for 5-HT2Cser and 5-HT2Ccys, respectively. DNAs from informative CEPH families were typed for this polymorphism and analyzed with respect to 20 linked markers on the X chromosome. Linkage analysis placed the 5-HT2C receptor gene (HTR2C) on Xq24. To evaluate whether this amino acid substitution causes a variant function of this receptor, recombinant human 5-HT2Ccys and 5-HT2Cser receptors were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and tested for responses to 5-HT using electrophysiological techniques. Concentration-response curves for 5-HT were not significantly different in oocytes expressing either form of the receptor, suggesting that the 5-HT2Ccys and 5-HT2Cser receptor proteins may not differ in their responses to serotonin under baseline physiological conditions.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
