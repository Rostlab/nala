Cloning and characterization of exon-flanking intronic sequences enabled us to investigate the whole coding region and the exon-intron boundaries of the human 5-HT7 receptor gene. Using single-strand conformational analysis, we screened for presence of DNA sequence variation in a sample of 137 unrelated individuals including 45 schizophrenic and 46 bipolar affective patients, as well as 46 healthy controls. We detected two rare naturally occurring receptor variants (Pro-279-Leu, Thr-92-Lys) and a silent nucleotide substitution (A--&gt;G) at position +1233. The occurrence of the Pro-279-Leu and Thr-92-Lys substitutions was studied in an extended sample of patients (n = 462) and controls (n = 335). The Leu-279 variant was found in similar frequency in all groups, indicating that presence of this variant is not causally related to the development of schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder. The Lys-92 variant was found in a single individual who suffered from bipolar affective disorder. Investigation of the patient's family revealed independent segregation between the Lys-92 variant and psychiatric illness. Our data suggests that genetic variation of the 5-HT7 receptor does not play a major role in the development of bipolar affective disorder and schizophrenia.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
