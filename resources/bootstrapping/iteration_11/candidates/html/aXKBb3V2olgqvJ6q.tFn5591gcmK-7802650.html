Genetic variation in genes coding for serotonin receptor proteins might well be involved in the genetic predisposition to these diseases and/or of pharmacogenetic relevance. Genomic samples from 46 unrelated healthy subjects were investigated by single-strand conformation analysis (SSCA) to screen for genetic variation in the human serotonin 1D beta (5-HT1D beta) receptor gene. Overlapping PCR (polymerase chain reaction) fragments covered the whole coding sequence as well as 5' untranslated regions of the 5-HT1D beta gene. Four nucleotide sequence variants were found: a coding mutation in nucleotide position 371 which leads to an amino acid exchange (Phe--&gt;Cys) in position 124 of the receptor protein and three mutations in the 5' flanking region. For all mutations specific PCR-based assays were developed which allow rapid genotyping in populations and families. To our knowledge, the Phe-124-Cys substitution is the first natural occurring molecular variant which has been identified for the 5-HT1D beta receptor so far.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
