A candidate gene for lysinuric protein intolerance.</p><p id="s1p2">We have identified a new human cDNA (y+L amino acid transporter-1 (y+LAT-1)) that induces system y+L transport activity with 4F2hc (the surface antigen 4F2 heavy chain) in oocytes. Human y+LAT-1 is a new member of a family of polytopic transmembrane proteins that are homologous to the yeast high affinity methionine permease MUP1. Other members of this family, the Xenopus laevis IU12 and the human KIAA0245 cDNAs, also co-express amino acid transport activity with 4F2hc in oocytes, with characteristics that are compatible with those of systems L and y+L, respectively. y+LAT-1 protein forms a approximately 135-kDa, disulfide bond-dependent heterodimer with 4F2hc in oocytes, which upon reduction results in two protein bands of approximately 85 kDa (i.e. 4F2hc) and approximately 40 kDa (y+LAT-1). Mutation of the human 4F2hc residue cysteine 109 (Cys-109) to serine abolishes the formation of this heterodimer and drastically reduces the co-expressed transport activity. These data suggest that y+LAT-1 and other members of this family are different 4F2 light chain subunits, which associated with 4F2hc, constitute different amino acid transporters. Human y+LAT-1 mRNA is expressed in kidney &gt; peripheral blood leukocytes &gt; lung &gt; placenta = spleen &gt; small intestine. The human y+LAT-1 gene localizes at chromosome 14q11.2 (17cR approximately 374 kb from D14S1350), within the lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI) locus (Lauteala, T., Sistonen, P. , Savontaus, M. L., Mykkanen, J., Simell, J., Lukkarinen, M., Simmell, O., and Aula, P. (1997) Am. J. Hum. Genet. 60, 1479-1486). LPI is an inherited autosomal disease characterized by a defective dibasic amino acid transport in kidney, intestine, and other tissues. The pattern of expression of human y+LAT-1, its co-expressed transport activity with 4F2hc, and its chromosomal location within the LPI locus, suggest y+LAT-1 as a candidate gene for LPI.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
