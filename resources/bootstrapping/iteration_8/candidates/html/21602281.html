Previous studies showed that the C terminus of SR-BI ("target peptide") binds directly to PDZ1 and influences hepatic SR-BI protein expression. Unexpectedly an inactivating mutation in PDZ1 (Tyr(20) → Ala) only partially, rather than completely, suppresses the ability of PDZK1 to control hepatic SR-BI. We used isothermal titration calorimetry to show that PDZ3, but not PDZ2 or PDZ4, can also bind the target peptide (K(d) = 37.0 μm), albeit with ∼10-fold lower affinity than PDZ1. This binding is abrogated by a Tyr(253) → Ala substitution. Comparison of the 1.5-Å resolution crystal structure of PDZ3 with its bound target peptide ((505)QEAKL(509)) to that of peptide-bound PDZ1 indicated fewer target peptide stabilizing atomic interactions (hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions) in PDZ3. A double (Tyr(20) → Ala (PDZ1) + Tyr(253) → Ala (PDZ3)) substitution abrogated all target peptide binding to PDZK1. In vivo hepatic expression of a singly substituted (Tyr(253) → Ala (PDZ3)) PDZK1 transgene (Tg) was able to correct all of the SR-BI-related defects in PDZK1 knock-out mice, whereas the doubly substituted [Tyr(20) → Ala (PDZ1) + Tyr(253) → Ala (PDZ3)]Tg was unable to correct these defects. Thus, we conclude that PDZK1-mediated control of hepatic SR-BI requires direct binding of the SR-BI C terminus to either the PDZ1 or PDZ3 domains, and that binding to both domains simultaneously is not required for PDZK1 control of hepatic SR-BI.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
