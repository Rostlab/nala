The disease is caused by mutations in the aspartoacylase gene. Two different mutations were reported on 98% of the alleles of Ashkenazi Jewish patients, in which population the disease is highly prevalent. In non-Jewish patients of European origin, one mutation (914C &gt; A) is found in 50% of the alleles, the other alleles representing all kinds of different mutations. We here describe the results of the mutation analysis in 17 European, non-Jewish patients. Ten different mutations were found, of which four had not been described before (H21P, A57T, R168H, P181T). A deletion of exon4, which until now had only been described once, was revealed in all five alleles of Turkish origin tested, indicating that this is a founder effect in the Turkish population.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
