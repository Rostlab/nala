In this study, we have discovered the molecular mechanism underlying the marked increase of plasma ACE levels observed in three unrelated individuals. We have identified a Pro(1199) --&gt; Leu mutation in the juxtamembrane stalk region. In vitro analysis revealed that the shedding of [Leu(1199)]ACE was enhanced compared with wild-type ACE. The solubilization process of [Leu(1199)]ACE was stimulated by phorbol esters and inhibited by compound 3, an inhibitor of ACE-secretase. The results of Western blot analysis were consistent with a cleavage at the major described site (Arg(1203)/Ser(1204)). Two-dimensional structural analysis of ACE showed that the mutated residue was critical for the positioning of a specific loop containing the cleavage site. We therefore propose that a local conformational modification caused by the Pro(1199) --&gt; Leu mutation leads to more accessibility at the stalk region for ACE secretase and is responsible for the enhancement of the cleavage-secretion process. Our results show that different molecular mechanisms are responsible for the common genetic variation of plasma ACE and for its more rare familial elevation.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
