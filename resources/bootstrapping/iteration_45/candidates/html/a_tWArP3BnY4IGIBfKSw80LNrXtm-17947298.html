We identified two pedigrees comprising 20 members segregating isolated autosomal dominant secundum ASD. By genetic mapping, we identified the gene-encoding alpha-cardiac actin (ACTC1), which is essential for cardiac contraction, as the likely candidate. A mutation screen of the coding regions of ACTC1 revealed a founder mutation predicting an M123V substitution in affected individuals of both pedigrees. Functional analysis of ACTC1 with an M123V substitution shows a reduced affinity for myosin, but with retained actomyosin motor properties. We also screened 408 sporadic patients with CHDs and identified a case with ASD and a 17-bp deletion in ACTC1 predicting a non-functional protein. Morpholino (MO) knockdown of ACTC1 in chick embryos produces delayed looping and reduced atrial septa, supporting a developmental role for this protein. The combined results indicate, for the first time, that ACTC1 mutations or reduced ACTC1 levels may lead to ASD without signs of cardiomyopathy.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
