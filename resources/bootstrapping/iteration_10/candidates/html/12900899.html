It is characterized by multiple cystic giant cell lesions of the jaw appearing in early childhood with stabilization and remission after puberty. In the present study, we used direct sequence analysis of the SH3BP2 gene of several individuals from a family with cherubism to search for additional SH3BP2 mutations resulting in cherubism. In affected relatives, we found a previously unreported G to A transition in exon 9 leading to a Gly to Arg substitution at amino acid position 420. G420R has been reported previously with a G to C transversion. To date there have been no disease causing mutations outside exon 9. Therefore, the amino acid sequence from positions 415 to 420 may represent a specific protein domain which, when disrupted, leads to the cherubism phenotype.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
