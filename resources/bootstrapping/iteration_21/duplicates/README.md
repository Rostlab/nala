We found on Monday 28 March 2016 duplicated annotations between itrs 20, 21 (annotated by jmcejuela) with itr 28 (annotated by cuhlig).
We mark the ones from 20 & 21 as duplicates because cuhlig had overall a better IAA F1.
Furthermore, previous experiments had been used cuhlig annotations before since they were overwritten.
