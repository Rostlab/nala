Here we describe a novel Hsp90 client - the intracellular tyrosine kinase, Fer, which is subjected to a unique regulatory regime by this chaperone. Inhibition of Hsp90 activity led to proteasomal degradation of the Fer enzyme. However, circumventing the dependence of Fer accumulation on Hsp90, revealed the dependence of the Fer kinase activity and its ability to phosphorylate Stat3 on the chaperone, expressing the necessity of Hsp90 for its function. Mutation analysis unveiled a tyrosine (Tyr(616)) embedded in the Hsp90 recognition loop, which is required for the kinase activity of Fer. Replacement of this tyrosine by phenylalanine (Y616F) disabled the auto-phosphorylation activity of Fer and abolished its ability to phosphorylate Stat3. Notably, surrounding the replaced Y616F with subtle mutations restored the auto and trans-phosphorylation activities of Fer suggesting that Y(616) is not itself an essential auto-phosphorylation site of the kinase. Taken together, our results portray Hsp90 and its recognition loop as novel positive regulators of the Fer tyrosine kinase stability and activity.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
