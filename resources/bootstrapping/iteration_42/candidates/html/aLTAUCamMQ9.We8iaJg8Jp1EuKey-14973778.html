The disease belongs to the group of congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) and is designated as subtype CDG-Ik. In patient-derived serum, the total amount of the glycoprotein transferrin was reduced. Moreover, a partial loss of N-glycan chains was observed, a characteristic feature of CDG type I forms. Metabolic labeling with [6-(3)H]glucosamine revealed an accumulation of GlcNAc(2)-PP-dolichol and GlcNAc(1)-PP-dolichol in skin fibroblasts of the patient. Incubation of fibroblast extracts with [(14)C]GlcNAc(2)-PP-dolichol and GDP-mannose indicated a severely reduced activity of the beta 1,4-mannosyltransferase, elongating GlcNAc(2)-PP-dolichol to Man(1)GlcNAc(2)-PP-dolichol at the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum. Genetic analysis of the patient's hALG1 gene identified a homozygous mutation leading to the exchange of a serine residue to leucine at position 258 in the hALG1 protein. The disease-causing nature of the hALG1 mutation for the glycosylation defect was verified by a retroviral complementation approach in patient-derived primary fibroblasts and was confirmed by the expression of wild-type and mutant hALG1 in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae alg1-1 strain.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
