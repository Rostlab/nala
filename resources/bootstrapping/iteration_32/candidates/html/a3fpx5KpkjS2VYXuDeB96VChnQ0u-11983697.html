During low oxygen tension these proteins modulate a network of genes that are necessary for angiogenesis, erythropopoiesis, and glycolysis. We report here that the C-terminal transactivation domain of HLF is phosphorylated on multiple sites and that phosphorylation on threonine 844 of HLF is necessary for the transcriptional activation function of the protein independently of the hypoxia condition. Importantly, using the mammalian two-hybrid system we demonstrate that a substitution of threonine 844 to an alanine decreased the enhanced transcriptional activation function mediated by CBP/p300.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
