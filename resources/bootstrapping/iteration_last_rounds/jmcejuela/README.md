jmcejuela, some notes while annotating the final iterations:

* https://www.tagtog.net/jmcejuela/nala/pool/alRxkMU77XPvzNlMWgNhoHCXUovO-11854867 -- problems with offsets, had to clear previous annotations
* https://www.tagtog.net/jmcejuela/nala/pool/aHs4K_obRwID03URqb.4wX1Hoky4-17255938 -- no clear position in annotation but domain vague position described before
* https://www.tagtog.net/jmcejuela/nala/pool/a1kSjet1rQ4u12cIEl2ahBznN0E0-8245005 -- also automatic annotations fine except that it didn't split correctly the mutations within parentheses, as in "Tyr-48 was mutated to phenylalanine (Y48F)" all together except of as correctly splitting
* https://www.tagtog.net/jmcejuela/nala/pool/aj8AQtDkZnbMWtYY6n4Kgtkd9e_C-8244338 -- problems with offsets, had to clear previous annotations
* https://www.tagtog.net/jmcejuela/nala/pool/aRVs8lqvWsW8w_AWegGhfsaLXA7O-3758060 -- interesting example of comparison of mutations between two homologous sequences (gamma 1 and 2)
* https://www.tagtog.net/jmcejuela/nala/pool/a.CEyI9ZwOc98ICRz4vkYTrq5V5G-8227344 -- many prediction errors on this one and left the prediction of "single base change in intron 10", although being quite unsure (position vague and unknown base)
* https://www.tagtog.net/jmcejuela/nala/pool/a1lYsk_NO7b8MzDToC4ZKVQgXHJe-1729171 -- vague annotation position on this one
* https://www.tagtog.net/jmcejuela/nala/pool/a5GIoafGB.hVhu6v3AetHSSGafnq-9417060 -- annotated alternate splicing as mutation
* https://www.tagtog.net/jmcejuela/nala/pool/a_V1Kp44ob9ckoi2gmDo_Iisv0ri-17894550 -- annotated mutations in separated parts ... kinda needa that in tagtog now
* https://www.tagtog.net/jmcejuela/nala/pool/agJGvKD2tj01KJnt50j7rTZs_rIi-12354786 -- vague...
* https://www.tagtog.net/jmcejuela/nala/pool/alilUYaGp6A0G0eXilWfPUpPRHI4-9158150 -- several prediction failures on this one
* https://www.tagtog.net/jmcejuela/nala/pool/a5Cn6Bp1MTC9RBfYEI8fMCxVD_FS-10359825 -- no position at all but found it work it to annotate
* https://www.tagtog.net/jmcejuela/nala/pool/aouUui9E93d7zGHZguhO1S7lXqaq-11875054 -- better follow rule of abbreviations in post processing to avoid dummy mistakes
* https://www.tagtog.net/jmcejuela/nala/pool/a08b5BSLbNfeJSCjLJPuVYZlep7q-1517212 -- again, a mutation mention divided into multiple parts, annotated both
* https://www.tagtog.net/jmcejuela/nala/pool/aB29nDf8S7XsC2hqVWTIAnI2W9DO-8589684 -- had to clean this doc... bug in offsets or in tagtog?
* https://www.tagtog.net/jmcejuela/nala/pool/aG..rP.14PFyG1iJ6ZsD1lgTBlyq-7599635 -- I fet the need to annotate from "A83..." to "Asp side chain", not accepted by tagtog max length -- we are bad at recognizing splice identifiers
* https://www.tagtog.net/jmcejuela/nala/pool/aPmjcYlqIQQ1BQ8xSqnF9MvSGp.0-9829906 -- annotated vague mentions biased for predicted vague mention
* https://www.tagtog.net/jmcejuela/nala/pool/aylPJ_AcZd3Lc2w2xE2qMxTsTZQ8-19713527 -- none predicted, and none annotated --> no mentions at all
