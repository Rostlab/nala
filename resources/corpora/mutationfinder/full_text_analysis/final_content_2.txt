9253338	Thus, after discovery of the Asp578 to Gly mutation (D578G) in the sixth transmembrane region of the LH/CGR gene in patients with familial and sporadic male-limited precocious puberty (13, 5), seven other mutations in the fifth and sixth transmembrane regions, two mutations in the third intracellular loop, and one mutation in the second transmembrane region of the LH/CGR have been found in patients with male-limited precocious puberty (311), all of which caused constitutively elevated cAMP levels in transfected cells in vitro (2, 4 8, 10, 11) We made four amino acid substitutions of the Phe576 (F576I, F576G, F576Y, F576E) in the LH/CG receptor to analyze its functional role In contrast, the F576G, F576I, and F576Y mutants were predicted to change the helical conformation in the region to an extended conformation Mutations predicted to cause an extended conformation exhibited two functional patterns: first, constitutively activating in cAMP signaling without changes in IP signaling or hCG binding (F576I and F576G), and second, constitutively activating in cAMP signaling with decreased hCG-induced cAMP and IP signaling and with both higher affinity and lower capacity of hCG binding (F576Y) These data suggest that the common change induced by the F576I, F576G, and F576Y mutations to an extended conformation on the third cytoplasmic loop and sixth transmembrane domain of the LH/CGR results in increased Gs coupling and activation of adenylyl cyclase The F576Y mutation appears to have an additional effect, beyond a modification in receptor conformation, that leads to higher affinity and lower capacity of hCG binding, as well as altered Gq coupling and phospholipase C activation Phe to Gly (F576G), Phe to Glu (F576E), Phe to Ile (F576I), and Phe to Tyr (F576Y) Cells transfected with F576Y cDNA exhibited 2.1 0.2fold higher basal cAMP levels; however, these cells exhibited a significantly lower hCG-induced increase in cAMP levels than did wild-type, F576I, or F576G receptors Maximal (10 7 mol/L) hCG-stimulated cAMP level in cells transfected with the F576Y mutant was only 5.6 0.3-fold higher than the control value Cells transfected with the F576E and the F576Y mutants showed minimal hCG-induced increases in IP levels at high hCG concentrations; i.e Cells transfected with the F576Y mutant bound 4.9% of added [125I]hCG; the Kd value was 5.1 10 10 m Cells transfected with the F576Y mutant exhibited 2-fold higher basal cAMP levels; however, these cells exhibited a lower hCG-induced increase in cAMP levels Cells transfected with F576E and F576Y showed minimal but significant hCG-induced increases in IP levels at high hCG concentration Basal and hCG-induced cAMP levels in COS-7 cells transfected with F576I, F576G, F576Y, F576E mutant, and wild-type hLH/ CGR cDNA Cells transfected with F576Y cDNA exhibited 2.1-fold higher basal cAMP levels Basal and hCG-induced IP levels in COS-7 cells transfected with F576I, F576G, F576Y, F576E mutant, and wild-type hLH/CGR cDNA Cells transfected with F576Y bound 5% of added [125I]hCG and exhibited higher affinity and lower capacity The F576G, F576I, and F576Y mutants are all predicted to change the helical conformation similarly to an extended conformation in the region of the sixth transmembrane domain (Fig Mutations predicted to cause an extended conformation exhibited two functional patterns: first, constitutively activated cAMP signaling without changes in IP signaling or hCG binding (F576I and F576G), and second, constitutively activated cAMP signaling with decreased hCG-induced cAMP and IP signaling, as well as higher affinity and lower capacity of hCG binding (F576Y) These data suggested that the common denominator of the F576I, F576G, and F576Y mutants is altered activation of adenylyl cyclase, i.e First, the F576Y mutant has effects that lead to higher binding affinity, lower capacity of hCG binding, and decreased Gq coupling and phospholipase C activation, in addition to its effects on Gs coupling, but these changes cannot be linked to the common conformational shift, because they are different from F576I and F576G Displacement of [125I]hCG by unlabeled hCG in COS-7 cells transfected with F576I, F576G, F576Y, F576E mutant, and wild-type hLH/CGR cDNA Cells transfected with F576Y exhibited a lower capacity as well as a higher affinity We made four amino acid substitutions of the Phe576 (F576I, F576G, F576Y, F576E) in the LH/CG receptor to analyze its functional role Computer analysis of secondary structure predicted that the F576E mutant changed the secondary structure to a totally helical conformation in the region of the third intracellular and sixth transmembrane domain The mutation predicted to cause a totally helical conformation resulted in no cAMP response and a minimal IP response to hCG stimulation, with negligible hCG binding (F576E) The F576E mutation has a distinct and different impact on receptor conformation, which leads to negligible hCG binding and minimal function; however, the F576E mutation may provide a clue to understanding the receptor mutations that result in loss of function and pseudohermaphroditism Phe to Gly (F576G), Phe to Glu (F576E), Phe to Ile (F576I), and Phe to Tyr (F576Y) The F576E mutant did not alter basal cAMP levels and did not exhibit a statistically significant increase in cAMP levels when exposed to hCG Cells transfected with the F576E and the F576Y mutants showed minimal hCG-induced increases in IP levels at high hCG concentrations; i.e Cells transfected with F576E exhibited negligible hCG binding The F576E mutant did not alter basal cAMP values and did not respond to hCG Cells transfected with F576E and F576Y showed minimal but significant hCG-induced increases in IP levels at high hCG concentration Basal and hCG-induced cAMP levels in COS-7 cells transfected with F576I, F576G, F576Y, F576E mutant, and wild-type hLH/ CGR cDNA F576E mutant did not alter basal cAMP levels and did not exhibit a statistically significant increase in cAMP levels when exposed to hCG Basal and hCG-induced IP levels in COS-7 cells transfected with F576I, F576G, F576Y, F576E mutant, and wild-type hLH/CGR cDNA Cells transfected with F576E exhibited negligible hCG binding In contrast, the F576E mutant changes the secondary structure to a totally helical conformation in the region The mutation predicted to cause a totally helical conformation resulted in no cAMP response and minimal but significant IP response to hCG stimulation, with negligible hCG binding (F576E) The totally different impact on receptor conformation of the F576E mutant and its association with decreased rather than increased Gs coupling strengthens the possibility that the extended conformation induced by the other mutations in this region is important for increased Gs coupling Displacement of [125I]hCG by unlabeled hCG in COS-7 cells transfected with F576I, F576G, F576Y, F576E mutant, and wild-type hLH/CGR cDNA Cells transfected with F576E exhibited negligible hCG binding Second, the fact that there is minimal but significant Gq coupling by the F576E mutant, despite negligible hCG binding and Gs coupling, suggests that at least some receptor has been incorporated into the bilayer, and that it is not a null mutation that results in a failure of the receptor to enter the bilayer; nevertheless, this cannot be excluded at this time We made four amino acid substitutions of the Phe576 (F576I, F576G, F576Y, F576E) in the LH/CG receptor to analyze its functional role In contrast, the F576G, F576I, and F576Y mutants were predicted to change the helical conformation in the region to an extended conformation Mutations predicted to cause an extended conformation exhibited two functional patterns: first, constitutively activating in cAMP signaling without changes in IP signaling or hCG binding (F576I and F576G), and second, constitutively activating in cAMP signaling with decreased hCG-induced cAMP and IP signaling and with both higher affinity and lower capacity of hCG binding (F576Y) These data suggest that the common change induced by the F576I, F576G, and F576Y mutations to an extended conformation on the third cytoplasmic loop and sixth transmembrane domain of the LH/CGR results in increased Gs coupling and activation of adenylyl cyclase Phe to Gly (F576G), Phe to Glu (F576E), Phe to Ile (F576I), and Phe to Tyr (F576Y) Results Basal and hCG-induced cAMP Levels in Cells Transfected with Mutant LH/CGRs In the absence of hCG, cells transfected with the F576I or the F576G mutants exhibited 3.2 0.4-fold or 2.7 0.2-fold higher basal cAMP levels, respectively, than cells transfected with wild-type receptor or with vector alone (Fig Maximal (10 7 mol/L) hCG-stimulated cAMP levels in cells transfected with the F576I mutant, F576G mutant, and the wild-type hLH/CGR were 10.0 0.6-fold, 10.8 0.7-fold, and 10.0 0.7-fold higher than the control value, respectively Cells transfected with F576Y cDNA exhibited 2.1 0.2fold higher basal cAMP levels; however, these cells exhibited a significantly lower hCG-induced increase in cAMP levels than did wild-type, F576I, or F576G receptors The maximal stimulated levels by hCG for the F576G mutant, 1.85 0.05fold, were slightly lower than the levels for wild-type receptor hCG Binding in Cells Transfected with Mutant LH/CGRs Binding of hCG to the F576I or the F576G mutants was similar to wild-type receptor COS-7 cells transfected with the F576I, the F576G mutants, and wild-type receptor cDNAs specifically bound 9.1%, 8.8%, and 10.5% of added [125I]hCG, respectively (Fig In the absence of hCG, cells transfected with the F576I or the F576G mutants exhibited 3-fold higher basal cAMP levels than cells transfected with wild-type receptor or with vector alone (Fig Cells transfected with F576I exhibited a similar hCG-induced increase in IP levels as cells transfected with wild-type receptor;

mutant CXCR4 was essentially equivalent to that of U373-CD4 cells expressing CCR5 (Fig To confirm these findings, we also performed virus infection experiments with luciferase reporterHIV-1 R5 Env pseudoviruses with the D187A, N11A, and N11A D187A mutant CXCR4s In general, we found results similar to those achieved with the cell-cell fusion assay; i.e., the combination mutant N11A D187A was better at supporting R5 Env-mediated fusion (as measured by virus entry) than was the N11A or D187A mutant alone with pseudoviruses composed of JR-FL, ADA, Ba-L, or SF162 (Fig We repeated this experiment numerous times, using several suitable target cell types, and achieved essentially the same results, with the relative light unit values being more than 1 log lower than those for CCR5 with the N11A D187A mutant and approximately 3 logs lower with the D187A mutant These HIV-1 pseudovirus infection results obtained with the D187A mutant are in contrast to recent results reported by Wang et al (58), who found very substantial virus entry luciferase signals with a D187A mutant CXCR4 expressed in U87-MG cells Although the -Gal levels were much lower, reflecting the fact that the vaccinia virus expression system yields much higher gene expression levels, the results again showed that the N11A D187A CXCR4 mutant functioned nearly as well as CCR5 as a coreceptor for R5 Envs (Fig With regard to the minor discrepancy between our results, obtained with the D187A mutant and virus infection, FIG (A) Wild-type CXCR4; (B) CXCR4 D187A; (C) CXCR4 N11A D187A; (D) wild-type CCR5 The combination of N11A and D187A mutations (the two most potent tropism-altering changes) had a better than additive effect and actually supported R5 Env-mediated cellcell fusion and syncytium formation at levels similar to CCR5 Interestingly, the N11A D187A mutant CXCR4 also supported HIV-1 R5 Env-pseudotyped virus entry, but not to the extent of CCR5 as a coreceptor We have also identified substitutions which greatly enhance or convert CXCR4's coreceptor activity to support R5 Env-mediated fusion (N11A, R30A, D187A, and D193A), and together our data suggest the presence of conserved

that at least some of these mutants (D155E and N363A) were expressed at equivalent levels based on radioligand binding (Table 1 and Fig We next examined two tryptamine analogs to identify the likely role of the Asp-155 locus in ligand recognition with stable cell lines for the native receptor and the D155E mutant To test these models, we evaluated the abilities N,N -dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and gramine to activate PI hydrolysis at the native and D155E mutant As shown in Table 1, only the D155E mutant expressed [3H]spiperone, binding whereas the D155A, D155N, and D155Q mutants were all unable to specifically bind either of the radioligands tested As is seen in Table 1, the D155E mutation decreased the affinity of the 5-HT2A receptor for a number of ligands Our finding that the D155A, -N, and -Q mutants were all unable to bind any ligand, coupled with the discovery that the D155E mutant had decreased affinity for a number of 5-HT2A agonists and antagonists (Table 1), suggests that the charge as well as relative orientation of the carboxylate group is essential for high-affinity binding We reasoned that if the Asp-155 locus binds the terminal nitrogen of tryptamines, and not the N-1 nitrogen, than gramine should be more active at the D155E mutant than at the native receptor 5 and Table 2, gramine was active at D155E receptors and inactive at native receptors In contrast, N,N -DMT was much more active at native receptors compared with the D155E mutant D155E Mutation Does Not Affect Receptor Expression But Does Affect Receptor Transport to Plasma Membrane As can be seen, the

these experiments, we increased the length of the carboxylate side chain of aspartic acid by one carbon by making the D155E mutant We reasoned that if the terminal and not indole nitrogen was anchored

receptor and that N,N -DMT should have lower efficacy at D155E compared with the native receptor As predicted, we discovered that gramine had negligible efficacy at the native receptor, whereas gramine was a partial agonist at the D155E receptor Additionally, N,N -DMT was less potent at the D155E compared with the native receptor Interestingly, the ability of gramine to activate the D155E receptor occurred despite the fact that the Asp-155E mutant was expressed predominantly intracellularly Docking gramine and DMT to these residues allows only for a favorable interaction between the terminal amine of gramine and D155E and DMT and Asp-155 (Fig D155E receptors are trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum The left-hand column shows results for native receptors, whereas the right-hand column shows results with the D155E mutant A small rim of plasma membrane 5-HT2A-like immunoreactivity is seen for the D155E mutant (large arrows) Molecular modeling predicts that gramine but not DMT will successfully interact with the D155E mutant receptor How the D155E mutation affects membrane targeting is not clear, although it is likely that an alteration of intramolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions (e.g., with Asn-343 in TMVI; Fig If misfolding occurred, we would have predicted that the D155E receptor would be unable to bind radioligands and activate second messenger production In fact, the D155E mutation was the only one of a series of four mutations at the Asp-155 locus that resulted in a functional receptor By contrast, the D155E mutant bound radioligands such as spiperone with high affinity and was able to be activated by 5-HT, DMT, gramine, and other agonists Finally, our studies demonstrate that the D155E mutation has an unexpected and important role for membrane targeting of the 5-HT2A receptor All of the mutants (D155A, D155N, D155E, D155Q, and S363A) resulted in receptors with reduced basal activity; in no case was evidence for constitutive activity revealed We also report that a series of mutations of the Asp-155 locus (D155A, -E, -Q, and -N) all result in receptors with decreased constitutive activity, a result that contradicts the salt-bridge hypothesis 3 and 4, stably transfected HEK-293 cells expressing the native 5-HT2A receptor had higher basal activities than cells expressing the D155A, D155E, D155N, D155Q (Fig As shown in Table 1,

that of His256 Nevertheless, a plausible explanation for the deleterious effect of the F259Y mutation on signaling would be a possible interaction of the Tyr259 phenoxyl with some other side chain

modulatory Ca2 ion in mGlu1, we performed each of the point mutations S147A and S170A in the rat CaR to test whether these amino acid residues are involved in the activation of CaR by Ca2 A much more dramatic effect was seen in the S170A-mutated CaR, which was unable to respond to Ca2 even at a concentration of 50 mM Like the results from the corresponding mutations on mGlu1, we found that CaR-S147A is functionally impaired, whereas CaR-S170A is totally unable to respond to the endogenous agonist Ca2 The lack of activity of the S170A mutated CaR could be caused by distortion of the protein folding Concentration-response curves of agonist-induced IP stimulation (expressed as disintegrations per minute (DPM) per 24-cluster well) in tsA cells transfected with wildtype CaR (q),

receptor densities (mean S.D.; n), calculated by the method of Swillens (18) and expressed as fmol per mg total cell protein, were as follows: WT-1D4 (1627 347; 4), N111A-1D4 (952 194; 4), N111G1D4 (1497 227; 4), NHA-AT1A (1396 162; 4), NHA-TK325 (650; 2), NHA-S335/T336A (1262 132; 3) and NHA-S331/ S338/S348/A (1237 102; 3) Hence, we compared the phosphorylation produced by AngII and [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII on wild type (NHA-AT1A) and mutated (NHA-S335/T336A and NHA-S331/S338/S348A) receptors For AngII stimulation, phosphorylation of the NHA-S335/T336A mutant was reduced to 80% of the wild type receptor, while the NHA-S331/S338/S348A mutant was reduced to 60% Following [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII stimulation, the double (NHA-S335/T336A) and triple (NHAS331/S338/S348A) mutants were phosphorylated to a level about 60% and 50%, respectively, of that observed with the wild type receptor (NHA-AT1A) The phosphorylation of NHA-AT1A and two carboxyl-terminal mutants (NHA-S335/T336A and NHA-S331/ S338/S348A) was determined in response to AngII (100 nM) and [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII (30 M ) for 10 min at 37 C Mutations at Ala293 (A293I and A293E) caused constitutive signaling (inositol phosphate production), which correlated well with an enhanced basal (agonist-independent) receptor phosphorylation D74E, Y302A), with severely compromised signaling to AngII (29, 30), displayed almost wild type levels of receptor internalization (19, 28, 30) Mutations at Ala293 (A293I and A293E) caused constitutive signaling (inositol phosphate production), which correlated well with an enhanced basal (agonist-independent) receptor phosphorylation D74E, Y302A), with severely compromised signaling to AngII (29, 30), displayed almost wild type levels of receptor internalization (19, 28, 30) In this study, we examined the phosphorylation and internalization of wild type and constitutively active mutants (N111A and N111G) of the type 1 (AT1A) angiotensin II receptor 1 AT1B, type 1 AngII receptor subtypes; CHO-K1, Chinese hamster ovary cells; HA, influenza hemagglutinin antigen; NHA-AT1A, NH2-terminally HA-tagged AT1A receptor; WT-1D4, N111A-1D4, N111G-1D4, wild type and mutated AT1A receptors with a carboxyl-terminal 1D4 epitope This paper is available on line at http://www.jbc.org 2893 have been reported, but engineered mutation of Asn111 to glycine (N111G) or alanine (N111A), in the third transmembrane helix of the AT1A receptor, leads to partial activation (10 12) Thus, in the absence of AngII binding, the N111G mutant displays 50%, and the N111A mutant 20% (10), of the maximal agonist-induced production of inositol phosphates In this study, we examined the phosphorylation and internalization of the N111A and N111G constitutively active mutants of the AT1A receptor Mutated versions of this receptor, where Asn111 in the third transmembrane-spanning domain is replaced with glycine (N111G) or alanine (N111A) (see Fig As previously observed (10, 12, 13), wild type and mutant receptors displayed low nanomolar affinity toward AngII; receptor densities (mean S.D.; n), calculated by the method of Swillens (18) and expressed as fmol per mg total cell protein, were as follows: WT-1D4 (1627 347; 4), N111A-1D4 (952 194; 4), N111G1D4 (1497 227;

these receptors remained poorly phosphorylated both basally and following AngII stimulation The position of Asn111 in the third transmembrane segment and the mutations (N111A and N111G) that produce constitutive activity are indicated Note the strong AngII-induced phosphorylation of WT-1D4, but the lack of AngII-stimulated phosphorylation for the N111A-1D4 and N111G-1D4 receptors Interestingly, the constitutive mutant (N111G) has an increased affinity for [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII (KD 6 nM) compared with wild type receptor, and this analogue promotes maximal signaling of N111G If the maximally signaling form (R*) of the receptor is the state targeted for phosphorylation (hereafter termed RP), then [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII, which drives the constitutive mutant receptor from R into the fully active R* form, should be expected to promote phosphorylation of the N111G receptor Remarkably, we observed that 30 M [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII ( 500 times the KD for N111G) was incapable of causing phosphorylation of the constitutively active AT1A receptors (Fig Cells expressing wild type, N111A, and N111G receptor mutants were treated with the non-peptide inverse agonist EXP3174 (100 nM for 16 h) Internalization kinetic curves comparing WT-1D4, N111A-1D4 and N111G-1D4 receptor expressing cells are shown in Fig Compared with wild type, the N111A mutant (t1/2, 3.5 min; Ymax, 66.9%) showed no significant reduction in receptor internalization, while the N111G receptor showed a slightly reduced maximal internalization (Ymax, 52.7%) and slower rate (t1/2, 6.0 min) We observed that the constitutively active AT1A receptors (N111A and N111G) are poor substrates for phosphorylation and that this cannot be modulated by AngII or [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII stimulation or by prior conversion of the constitutive receptors to the basal state by pretreatment with the inverse agonist, EXP3174 A, internalization kinetics of the WT-1D4 receptor and the mutants, N111A1D4 and N111G-1D4, were determined using binding of 125I-AngII for various time periods at 37 C, as described under "Experimental Procedures." B, internalization of WT-1D4 receptors in response to unlabeled AngII (100 nM) or [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII (30 M) for 10 min at 37 C was determined by measuring cell surface receptor density (125I-AngII binding, 5 h at 4 C) with and without stimulation Mutation of Asn111 to glycine (N111G), in the absence of ligand, is thought to imitate the intermediate form of the wild type receptor (L.R ) Stimulation of N111G by both AngII and [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII produces the L.R* form and maximal signaling, but because the N111G receptor appears blocked in its transition to L.R** it is not phosphorylated B, schematic flow diagram of the transitional states attained by the wild type and N111G receptors, following stimulation by AngII and [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII, leading to signaling (S), internalization (I), and phosphorylation (P) It was therefore somewhat surprising in the present study to observe that, despite the lack of AngII-mediated phosphorylation of N111A and N111G, the internalization kinetics for 125I-AngII of N111A was unaffected and only slightly reduced in the case of N111G Despite the unequivocal importance of the aromatic-amide bond between Tyr4 in AngII and Asn111 in AT1A for receptor activation (31), it is interesting that the constitutively active Asn111 mutants (N111A and N111G) retain a capacity for AngII-induced internalization In direct contrast, mutations at Asp142 (D142A and D142T), despite yielding greater levels of constitutive activation compared with the Ala293 mutants, showed no increase in basal phosphorylation as well as a lack of epinephrine-induced phosphorylation Mutated versions of the NHA-AT1A receptor with reduced AngII-stimulated phosphorylation (S335/T336A) (14) and a triple mutant (S331/ S338/S348A) (15) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and confirmed by sequencing Hence, we compared the phosphorylation produced by AngII and [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII on wild type (NHA-AT1A) and mutated (NHA-S335/T336A and NHA-S331/S338/S348A) receptors For AngII stimulation, phosphorylation of the NHA-S335/T336A mutant was reduced to 80% of the wild type receptor, while the NHA-S331/S338/S348A mutant was reduced to 60% Following [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII stimulation, the double (NHA-S335/T336A) and triple (NHAS331/S338/S348A) mutants were phosphorylated to a level about 60% and 50%, respectively, of that observed with the wild type receptor (NHA-AT1A) The phosphorylation of NHA-AT1A and two carboxyl-terminal mutants (NHA-S335/T336A and NHA-S331/ S338/S348A) was determined in response to AngII (100 nM) and [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII (30 M ) for 10 min at 37 C Mutated versions of the NHA-AT1A receptor with reduced AngII-stimulated phosphorylation (S335/T336A) (14) and a triple mutant (S331/ S338/S348A) (15) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and confirmed by sequencing Hence, we compared the phosphorylation produced by AngII and [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII on wild type (NHA-AT1A) and mutated (NHA-S335/T336A and NHA-S331/S338/S348A) receptors For AngII stimulation, phosphorylation of the NHA-S335/T336A mutant was reduced to 80% of the wild type receptor, while the NHA-S331/S338/S348A mutant was reduced to 60% Following [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII stimulation, the double (NHA-S335/T336A) and triple (NHAS331/S338/S348A) mutants were phosphorylated to a level about 60% and 50%, respectively, of that observed with the wild type receptor (NHA-AT1A) The phosphorylation of NHA-AT1A and two carboxyl-terminal mutants (NHA-S335/T336A and NHA-S331/ S338/S348A) was determined in response to AngII (100 nM) and [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII (30 M ) for 10 min at 37 C Mutated versions of the NHA-AT1A receptor with reduced AngII-stimulated phosphorylation (S335/T336A) (14) and a triple mutant (S331/ S338/S348A) (15) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and confirmed by sequencing Hence, we compared the phosphorylation produced by AngII and [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII on wild type (NHA-AT1A) and mutated (NHA-S335/T336A and NHA-S331/S338/S348A) receptors For AngII stimulation, phosphorylation of the NHA-S335/T336A mutant was reduced to 80% of the wild type receptor, while the NHA-S331/S338/S348A mutant was reduced to 60% Following [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII stimulation, the double (NHA-S335/T336A) and triple (NHAS331/S338/S348A) mutants were phosphorylated to a level about 60% and 50%, respectively, of that observed with the wild type receptor (NHA-AT1A) The phosphorylation of NHA-AT1A and two carboxyl-terminal mutants (NHA-S335/T336A and NHA-S331/ S338/S348A) was determined in response to AngII (100 nM) and [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII (30 M ) for 10 min at 37 C In this study, we examined the phosphorylation and internalization of wild type and constitutively active mutants (N111A and N111G) of the type 1 (AT1A) angiotensin II receptor 1 AT1B, type 1 AngII receptor subtypes;

4), NHA-AT1A (1396 162; 4), NHA-TK325 (650; 2), NHA-S335/T336A (1262 132; 3) and NHA-S331/ S338/S348/A (1237 102; 3) All constructs were maximally activated by the full agonist, [Sar1]AngII, while only N111A-1D4 (partially) and N111G-1D4 (maximally) responded to [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII stimulation Basal and AngII-stimulated Phosphorylation of Constitutive Multiple AT1A Receptor States 2894 AT1A Receptors--Receptor phosphorylation was determined in CHO-K1 cells expressing 1D4 epitope-tagged wild type (WT1D4) or constitutively active mutants (N111A-1D4 and N111G1D4) of the rat AT1A receptor Surprisingly, the basal phosphorylation of the constitutively active mutant receptors (N111A-1D4 and N111G-1D4) was not increased, and if anything was slightly decreased, compared with WT-1D4 EXP3174 is a non-peptide antagonist of the AT1 receptor and pretreatment with EXP3174 of cells expressing the constitutively active AT1A mutants (N111A and N111G) reduces the basal inositol phosphate generation by 70 90% (10, 11) We next examined whether conversion of the N111A and N111G receptors back to the basal (R) state by treatment with EXP3174 would allow a subsequent AngIIinduced receptor phosphorylation event to occur 3, EXP3174 treatment (100 nM, 16 h) did not reveal a cryptic AngII-induced phosphorylation of N111A-1D4 or N111G-1D4 receptors; these receptors remained poorly phosphorylated both basally and following AngII stimulation The position of Asn111 in the third transmembrane segment and the mutations (N111A and N111G) that produce constitutive activity are indicated *, inositol phosphate data for N111A-1D4 are comparative values from a previous study (12), not performed in parallel Note the strong AngII-induced phosphorylation of WT-1D4, but the lack of AngII-stimulated phosphorylation for the N111A-1D4 and N111G-1D4 receptors Cells expressing wild type, N111A, and N111G receptor mutants were treated with the non-peptide inverse agonist EXP3174 (100 nM for 16 h) Internalization kinetic curves comparing WT-1D4, N111A-1D4 and N111G-1D4 receptor expressing cells are shown in Fig Compared with wild type, the N111A mutant (t1/2, 3.5 min; Ymax, 66.9%) showed no significant reduction in receptor internalization, while the N111G receptor showed a slightly reduced maximal internalization (Ymax, 52.7%) and slower rate (t1/2, 6.0 min) We observed that the constitutively active AT1A receptors (N111A and N111G) are poor substrates for phosphorylation and that this cannot be modulated by AngII or [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII stimulation or by prior conversion of the constitutive receptors to the basal state by pretreatment with the inverse agonist, EXP3174 A, internalization kinetics of the WT-1D4 receptor and the mutants, N111A1D4 and N111G-1D4, were determined using binding of 125I-AngII for various time periods at 37 C, as described under "Experimental Procedures." B, internalization of WT-1D4 receptors in response to unlabeled AngII (100 nM) or [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII (30 M) for 10 min at 37 C was determined by measuring cell surface receptor density (125I-AngII binding, 5 h at 4 C) with and without stimulation It was therefore somewhat surprising in the present study to observe that, despite the lack of AngII-mediated phosphorylation of N111A and N111G, the internalization kinetics for 125I-AngII of N111A was unaffected and only slightly reduced in the case of N111G Despite the unequivocal importance of the aromatic-amide bond between Tyr4 in AngII and Asn111 in AT1A for receptor activation (31), it is interesting that the constitutively active Asn111 mutants (N111A and N111G) retain a capacity for AngII-induced internalization

Cys, and Ala-193 3 Cys, indicating that the face of TMD 5 accessible from the binding site crevice is consistent with a recent model by Baldwin and colleagues of the transmembrane domain of the 7-transmembrane receptors In contrast, the mutation Phe-190 3 Cys caused a 6-fold increase in ACh affinity, and a reduction in the Hill coefficient (nH 0.70) (Fig Binding of Other Agonists The effects of the Cys mutations of Ile-188, Thr-189, Phe190, Thr-192, and Ala-196 on the binding affinities of two other muscarinic agonists of high efficacy, carbachol and oxotremorine-M were qualitatively similar to but quantitatively smaller than their effects on the binding of ACh (carbachol: 3-fold increase at Phe-190 3 Cys, 7-fold reduction at Thr-192 3 Cys, 3-fold reduction at Ala-196 3 Cys; oxotremorine-M: 2-fold increase at Phe-190 3 Cys, 4-fold reduction at Thr-192 3 Cys, 8-fold reduction at Ala-196 3 Cys) The mutation Phe-190 3 Cys resulted in a 10-fold increase in ACh potency, again in parallel to the binding assay (Fig The Hill coefficient of the wild-type binding curve was 0.88 0.04 and was unaltered except for Thr-189 3 Cys (0.66 0.03) and Phe-190 3 Cys (0.70 0.03) Calculations of signaling efficacy, as described previously (Lu and Hulme, 1999; Ward et al., 1999), showed decreases of 4-fold for Thr-192 3 Ala, 7-fold for Ala-196 3 Gly, and an increase of 4-fold for Phe-190 3 Cys The maximum PI response elicited by the partial agonist pilocarpine was also significantly increased from 72% of the maximal ACh response in the case of the wild-type receptor to 96% of the response for the Phe-190 3 Cys mutant (Fig Analysis of the Phe-190 3 Cys mutant Analysis of the wild-type and Phe-190 3 Cys mutant using a two-site model of binding gave pKd values of 4.7 and 5.2 for the low affinity sites and 5.7 and 6.7 for the high affinity sites, respectively b, PI dose-response curves for ACh potency at the wild-type (F), Phe-190 3 Cys ( ), and Phe-190 3 Ala (E) M1 mAChRs Atropine or NMS (10 6 M) were added to COS-7 cells expressing wild-type and Phe-190 3 Cys receptors 24 h before assay d, pilocarpine dose-response curves for the wild-type and Phe-190 3 Cys mutant receptors The corrected pIC50 for the wildtype receptor was 4.22, assuming competitive behavior with [3H]NMS, and this appeared similar for all of the mutant receptors with the exception of Phe-190 3 Cys, where the apparent affinity was 3-fold higher (Table 3) Unlike BrACh, it also showed evidence of reaction with Phe-190 3 Cys but not with the other Cys mutants Calculation of the apparent rate constants for blockade of the mutants by MTSET gave values of 670 M 1min 1 for Phe-190 3 Cys and 1300 M 1min 1 for Thr-192 3 Cys and Ala-193 3 Cys Pretreatment of the Phe-190 3 Cys, Thr-192 3 Cys, and Ala-193 3 Cys mutants with 10 mM iodoacetamide did not block their subsequent reaction with BrACh or MTSET Pretreatment of the Phe-190 3 Cys and Ala-193 3 Cys mutants with 1 mM BrACh did not affect the subsequent block of [3H]NMS binding by MTSET, provided that the free BrACh concentration was reduced first; this was achieved by pelleting the membranes and resuspending them Similar results were obtained at 0.3 mM MTSET: percent block values were wild-type, 30 9%; Phe-190 3 Cys, 65 5%; Thr-192 3 Cys, 91 11%; Ala-193 3 Cys, 94 6% Expression of the mutant receptors was reduced to less than 30% of the wild-type level only in the case of Met-194 3 Cys (1227%) Most of the mutants (illustrated by the Met-194 3 Cys mutant, Fig Mutant pKd n Expression log M % WT WT 9.91

indicating that the face of TMD 5 accessible from the binding site crevice is consistent with a recent model by Baldwin and colleagues of the transmembrane domain of the 7-transmembrane receptors Results Binding of [3H]NMS Of the mutations of Ile-188 through Ala-196, in TMD 5 of the M1 mAChR, only those of Ala-193 significantly affected the affinity of the receptor for the antagonist [3H]NMS, causing reductions of 3.6-fold (Ala-193 3 Cys) and 2.6-fold (Ala193 3 Gly) with respect to the wild-type (pKd 9.9; Table 1) Assays with a second antagonist, ( )-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate did not show a reduction in affinity (pKd 10.6 for wild-type; 10.6 for Ala-193 3 Gly; 11.0 for Ala-193 3 Cys) The Ala-193 3 Cys mutant showed intermediate behavior b, time course of binding of [3H]NMS (0.3 nM) to Thr-192 3 Cys (OE), Ala-193 3 Cys (f), Met-194 Cys ( ), and wild-type (E) M1 mAChRs in the presence of BrACh (1 mM) However, NMS, at concentrations up to 10 nM, did not appreciably affect the small degree of inhibition of Ala-193 3 Cys by BrACh A 10-min incubation led to 37% block of the binding of [3H]NMS to Thr-192 3 Cys and 23% block of Ala-193 3 Cys Using a 10min incubation, 0.1 mM MTSET gave less than 20% block of the wild-type receptor but over 70% block of Thr-192 3 Cys and Ala-193 3 Cys Calculation of the apparent rate constants for blockade of the mutants by MTSET gave values of 670 M 1min 1 for Phe-190 3 Cys and 1300 M 1min 1 for Thr-192 3 Cys and Ala-193 3 Cys Pretreatment of the Phe-190 3 Cys, Thr-192 3 Cys, and Ala-193 3 Cys mutants with 10 mM iodoacetamide did not block their subsequent reaction with BrACh or MTSET Pretreatment of the Phe-190 3 Cys and Ala-193 3 Cys mutants with 1 mM BrACh did not affect the subsequent block of [3H]NMS binding by MTSET, provided that the free BrACh concentration was reduced first; this was achieved by pelleting the membranes and resuspending them Pretreatment of the mutant receptors with NMS gave 90% protection of all three Cys mutant receptors against block by 0.1 mM MTSET, with IC50 values of approximately 0.3 nM (Thr-192 3 Cys, Ala-193 3 Cys) and 0.9 nM (Phe-190 3 Cys) Similar results were obtained at 0.3 mM MTSET: percent block values were wild-type, 30 9%; Phe-190 3 Cys, 65 5%; Thr-192 3 Cys, 91 11%; Ala-193 3 Cys, 94 6% Mutant pKd n Expression log M % WT WT 9.91 0.02 8 100 I188C 10.00 0.05 4 26 41

sulfhydryl reagent N-trimethyl-2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate reacted selectively with Phe-190 3 Cys, Thr-192 3 Cys, and Ala-193 3 Cys, indicating that the face of TMD 5 accessible from the binding site crevice is consistent with a recent model by Baldwin and colleagues of the transmembrane domain of the 7-transmembrane receptors In contrast, the acetylcholine derivative bromoacetylcholine reacted selectively with Thr-192 3 Cys, which forms the focus of a group of amino acids (Ile-188, Thr-189, Thr-192, Ala-196) whose mutation decreased the binding affinity of the transmitter ACh itself Selective blockade of the Thr-192 3 Cys mutant by BrACh suggests that the alkylating side chain of the affinity label can contact position 5.42 Binding of Other Agonists The effects of the Cys mutations of Ile-188, Thr-189, Phe190, Thr-192, and Ala-196 on the binding affinities of two other muscarinic agonists of high efficacy, carbachol and oxotremorine-M were qualitatively similar to but quantitatively smaller than their effects on the binding of ACh (carbachol: 3-fold increase at Phe-190 3 Cys, 7-fold reduction at Thr-192 3 Cys, 3-fold reduction at Ala-196 3 Cys; oxotremorine-M: 2-fold increase at Phe-190 3 Cys, 4-fold reduction at Thr-192 3 Cys, 8-fold reduction at Ala-196 3 Cys) The affinity of the oxadiazole agonist L-698,583 (Ward et al., 1999) was reduced only 3-fold by the Thr-192 3 Cys mutation, and this compound was not investigated further The Emax values ranged from 82 2% (Thr-192 3 Cys) to 130 13% (Ala-193 3 Gly) In contrast, the binding of [3H]NMS to the Thr-192 3 Cys mutant did not increase between 15 min and 2 h in the presence of 1 mM BrACh (Fig To examine the concentration dependence of BrACh blockade of Thr-192 3 Cys receptors, membrane preparations were incubated with different concentrations of BrACh using a concentration of the membrane fraction 10 times that normally used in binding assays The block of the Thr-192 3 Cys mutant by BrACh increased from 0.03 mM and reached a plateau at 1 mM, at which point approximately 50% of the [3H]NMS binding sites were occluded b, time course of binding of [3H]NMS (0.3 nM) to Thr-192 3 Cys (OE), Ala-193 3 Cys (f), Met-194 Cys ( ), and wild-type (E) M1 mAChRs in the presence of BrACh (1 mM) The affinity of [3H]NMS for wild-type or Thr-192 3 Cys receptors was unaltered by pretreatment with BrACh Although the Bmax value of the wild-type membranes was not significantly affected, the Bmax value of the Thr-192 3 Cys membranes was reduced by 70 14% (n 2) A 10-min incubation led to 37% block of the binding of [3H]NMS to Thr-192 3 Cys and 23% block of Ala-193 3 Cys BrACh did not activate the Thr-192 3 Cys mutant (Fig either the wild-type or the Thr-192 3 Cys mutant receptor at concentrations up to 10 mM Similarly, the negatively charged MTSES did not react with the wild-type receptor, or with the Thr-192 3 Cys mutant Using a 10min incubation, 0.1 mM MTSET gave less than 20% block of the wild-type receptor but over 70% block of Thr-192 3 Cys and Ala-193 3 Cys Calculation of the apparent rate constants for blockade of the mutants by MTSET gave values of 670 M 1min 1 for Phe-190 3 Cys and 1300 M 1min 1 for Thr-192 3 Cys and Ala-193 3 Cys Pretreatment of the Phe-190 3 Cys, Thr-192 3 Cys, and Ala-193 3 Cys mutants with 10 mM iodoacetamide did not block their subsequent reaction with BrACh or MTSET Similarly, in the case of the Thr-192 3 Cys mutant, the [3H]NMS binding sites that had not reacted with BrACh were blocked by subsequent reaction with MTSET Pretreatment of the mutant receptors with NMS gave 90% protection of all three Cys mutant receptors against block by 0.1 mM MTSET, with IC50 values of approximately 0.3 nM (Thr-192 3 Cys, Ala-193 3 Cys) and 0.9 nM (Phe-190 3 Cys) (F) ACh, wild-type; (E) BrACh, wild-type; (,) BrACh, Thr-192 3 Cys Similar results were obtained at 0.3 mM MTSET: percent block values were wild-type, 30 9%; Phe-190 3 Cys, 65 5%; Thr-192 3 Cys, 91 11%; Ala-193 3 Cys, 94 6% The rate constant estimated for the BrACh reaction with Thr-192 3 Cys (greater than 150 M 1s 1) was slower than that reported for its reaction with the reduced nicotinic receptor binding site (5000 M 1s 1; Damle et al Both the selectivity of BrACh for the Thr-192 3 Cys mutant and the attenuation of the effect of the Thr192 3 Ala and Thr-192 3 Cys mutations by the alteration (carbachol) or deletion (formylcholine) of the terminal methyl group of ACh suggest that interactions between the ester methyl group of ACh and the methyl group of Thr-192 make a significant contribution to the binding of ACh

receptor We therefore mutated the Asn4, Asn176, and Asn188 residues of an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged rat AT1a-R (HAAT1a-R) in various combinations (to lysine, glutamine, and glutamine, respectively) to generate three single-point mutant receptors (N4K, N176Q, and N188Q), three double-point mutant receptors (N4K/N176Q, N4K/N188Q, and N176Q/ N188Q), and a triple-point mutant receptor (N4K/N176Q/ N188Q) This was confirmed when the photoaffinity-labeled triple-point mutant receptor, N4K/ N176Q/N188Q (which lacks any N-linked glycosylation sites), was found to migrate as a doublet with an approximate Mr of 40,000 (Fig To determine whether the glycosylation machinery in COS-7 cells is able to couple carbohydrate moieties to each of the three putative glycosylation

glycosylation site Each of these receptors exhibited decreased mobility in SDS-PAGE compared with the N4K/ N176Q/N188Q triple-point mutant receptor, indicating that each of the putative sites can be glycosylated in COS-7 cells Like the nonglycosylated N4K/N176Q/N188Q receptor in COS-7 cells, complete deglycosylation of the BAG cell AT1-R gave rise to a doublet with an Mr of approximately 40,000,

HA-AT1a-Rs was less than to the wild-type receptor, and its binding to the doublepoint mutant receptors (31%, 21%, and 36% of wild-type for the N176Q/N188Q, N4K/N176Q, and N4K/N188Q receptors, respectively) was generally lower than to the singlepoint mutant receptors (30%, 47%, and 60% of wild-type for the N4K, N176Q, and N188Q receptors, respectively) (Fig Specific binding to the triple-point mutant receptor, N4K/ N176Q/N188Q, was very low (4% of wild-type) In general, the more glycosylation sites that were mutated, the greater was the reduction in receptor expression, such that the nonglycosylated N4K/N176Q/N188Q receptor was expressed at a very low level compared with the wild-type receptor Although single-site glycosylation at Asn4, Asn176, or Asn188 is sufficient to confer some protection from degradation (compared with the nonglycosylated N4K/ N176Q/N188Q receptor), further protection is provided by glycosylation at one or two additional sites However, since no N4K/N176Q/N188Q receptors (and little of the double-point mutant receptors) were detectable in immunoblots, it is likely that proteolysis occurs rapidly after receptor synthesis An increasing number of mutated glycosylation sites was associated with decreasing cell surface receptor expression, which was very low for the unglycosylated N4K/N176Q/N188Q receptor Mutation at each glycosylation site, either alone or in combination, had little effect on ligand binding parameters (although the N4K mutant had higher affinity) or signaling activity However, an increasing number of mutated glycosylation sites was associated with decreasing cell surface receptor expression, which was minimal for the unglycosylated N4K/ N176Q/N188Q receptor We therefore mutated the Asn4, Asn176, and

However, there was a marked discrepancy between the intensity of photoaffinity labeling for the N4K and N176Q single-point mutant receptors and their signal intensities in immunoblotting Whereas the intensity of photoaffinity labeling for the N4K receptor was greater than for the N176Q receptor (Fig 4A), the immunoblotting signal of the N176Q receptor was greater than that of the N4K receptor (Fig Binding characteristics of mutant HA-AT1a-Rs The specific binding of the peptide antagonist, 125I- [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II, to each of the mutant HA-AT1a-Rs was less than to the wild-type receptor, and its binding to the doublepoint mutant receptors (31%, 21%, and 36% of wild-type for the N176Q/N188Q, N4K/N176Q, and N4K/N188Q receptors, respectively) was generally lower than to the singlepoint mutant receptors (30%, 47%, and 60% of wild-type for the N4K, N176Q, and N188Q receptors, respectively) (Fig Specific binding to the triple-point mutant receptor, N4K/ N176Q/N188Q, was very low (4% of wild-type) However, the binding data for the N4K mutant receptor did not transform to linearity in Scatchard analysis (data not shown) Therefore, to compare the binding affinity of the N4K mutant receptor with that of the wild-type receptor, we measured the rates of association and dissociation of 125I-Ang II to membranes prepared from COS-7 cells expressing each receptor This experiment revealed not only that 125I-Ang II associated more rapidly with the N4K mutant receptor than with the wild-type receptor (Fig 6A), but also that it dissociated more slowly from the N4K mutant receptor than it did from the wild-type receptor (Fig Further analysis of this kinetic binding data revealed that the rates of 125I-Ang II association and dissociation at the N4K mutant receptor were approximately twice and half, respectively, of those at the wild-type receptor These data suggest that the binding affinity of the N4K mutant receptor for agonist ligands is approximately 4-fold greater than that of the wild-type receptor Similar results were obtained when an S6A mutant HA-AT1a-R, containing a mutation to alanine at Ser6 (which forms part of the consensus sequence for glycosylation at Asn4), was used in place of the N4K mutant receptor (data not shown) Hence, the apparently higher affinity of the N4K mutant receptor probably explains its relatively greater photoaffinity labeling compared with the wild-type receptor (Fig Kinetics of 125I-Ang II binding to the N4K mutant HA-AT1a-R In panel A, membranes prepared from wild-type (E) or N4K mutant (F) HA-AT1a-R-expressing COS-7 cells were incubated with 125I-Ang II in the presence or absence of an excess (10 M ) of unlabeled [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II for the indicated times at 25 C Specific 125I-Ang II binding to wild-type (E) or N4K mutant (F) HA-AT1a-R-expressing COS-7 cell membranes was then determined at the indicated times In general, the more glycosylation sites that were mutated, the greater was the reduction in receptor expression, such that the nonglycosylated N4K/N176Q/N188Q receptor was expressed at a very low level compared with the wild-type receptor Although single-site

Functional characterization of 2 novel activating mutations Except for 2 (L629F and del658 661), all mutations have been documented and analyzed functionally by transfection in COS-7 cells (5, 8, 12, 21, 22, 24 26) Whereas L629F is included in the major hot spot area at the basis of transmembrane VI, del658 661 is unusual both in its location (the border between the 3rd exoloop and transmembrane segment VII) and its nature (a deletion of 12 bases, removing 4 aminoacids) When transfected in COS-7 cells, L629F behaves as most other activating mutants described previously: it causes an increase in basal cAMP accumulation, as compared with the wild-type receptor (Fig Expression of L629F mutant at the cell surface is lower than the wild-type (Fig Whereas it causes larger increase of basal cAMP accumulation than L629F (Fig Similar to L629F, del658 661 has no effect on basal inositolphosphate accumulation (Fig 3, panel b), but contrary to L629F, it has completely lost the ability to respond to TSH for stimulation of both adenylyl-cyclase and phospholipase C (Fig Two novel mutations have been identified: the first, L629F, can be added to the list of mutations affecting the hot spot in

10217436	To determine whether constitutive activation caused by the A843E mutation is due to substitution of A843 or specically requires the substitution by glutamate, we created several addition mutants, substituting A843 with either positively charged lysine (A843K) or uncharged valine (A843V) The PI response of A840E and A843K mutants demonstrated a leftward shift compared to wildtype, whereas the A843V mutant showed a rightward shift compared to wild-type 3, mutant hCaRs (A116T, A840E, A843K, A843V) were all expressed at levels close to that of the wild-type Failure of the maximum PI response of mutant hCaRs (A840E, A843K, A843V) to reach wild-type levels cannot therefore be ascribed to a reduced cell surface expression However, even mutations in the transmembrane domains of the CaR (F788C and L773R in TM5, F806 in TM6) or in the rst extracellular loop (Q681H) have shown an enhanced sensitivity to CaP rather than constitutive activation when expressed [7,10,16] However, even mutations in the transmembrane domains of the CaR (F788C and L773R in TM5, F806 in TM6) or in the rst extracellular loop (Q681H) have shown an enhanced sensitivity to CaP rather than constitutive activation when expressed [7,10,16] Spiegel* Metabolic Diseases Branch, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Building 10, Room 9N-222, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA Received 10 February 1999 Abstract A missense mutation, A843E, in the seventh transmembrane domain of the human CaP+ receptor, identified in a subject with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia, was found to cause a constitutive activation while at the same time lowering the maximal response of the receptor to CaP+ The A843E mutant version of this truncated receptor showed constitutive activation During the course of our studies on expression of mutant CaRs, we found that a mutation, alanine 843 to glutamate (A843E), identied in the seventh transmembrane domain of the hCaR in a subject with hypocalcemia and hypercalciuria [10] causes a true constitutive activation By constructing a form of the hCaR that lacked the ECD but still was expressed at the cell surface, we were able to show that constitutive activation caused by the A843E mutation does not depend on an intact ECD The response of two dierent missense mutants identied in subjects with ADH, alanine 116 to threonine (A116T) [16] and A843E [10], was compared in this assay with the wild-type hCaR (Fig The PI response of the A843E mutant, in contrast, even in the absence of extracellular CaP, corresponds to 50^60% of the maximum response of the wild-type hCaR The A843E mutant, however, does not reach the same level of activation as the wild-type receptor even at very high CaP concentrations The A843E mutant CaP-independent activation of PI hydrolysis was observed over a range of transfected cDNA from 0.25 to 6 Wg/ml In contrast, transfection with A843E mutant cDNA increased FEBS 21836 29-3-99 Fig Concentration-dependence for the CaP stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis in transiently transfected HEK-293 cells expressing wild-type and activating mutant (A116T and A843E) hCaR cDNAs To determine whether constitutive activation caused by the A843E mutation is due to substitution of A843 or specically requires the substitution by glutamate, we created several addition mutants, substituting A843 with either positively charged lysine (A843K) or uncharged valine (A843V) Unlike A843E, none of these mutants caused a constitutive activation, although like A843E, the maximal activation of all these mutants was only 50^60% of that of the wild-type (Fig As for the constitutively activating mutant A843E, its average cell surface expression level is signicantly lower, corresponding to 85% of the wild-type expression Thus, the increased cell surface expression cannot account for the constitutive activation observed for the A843E mutant Expression of truncated hCaRs lacking the ECD We hypothesized that the ability of the A843E mutation to constitutively activate the hCaR was not dependent on an intact ECD We next generated a form of rho-C-hCaR containing the A843E mutation and compared the PI hydrolysis response to CaP of cells transfected with rho-C-hCaR, rho-C-hCaR(A843E) and wild-type hCaR cDNAs Rho-C-hCaR showed no response to CaP, whereas the rho-C-hCaR(A843E) mutant showed constitutive activation at a level only slightly lower than that of the full length A843E hCaR mutant (Fig Concentration-dependence for the CaP stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis in transiently transfected HEK-293 cells expressing the wild-type, rho-C-hCaR and rho-C-hCaR(A843E) cDNAs The A843E mutation in TM7 functionally characterized in this paper is the rst example of a CaR mutation causing a constitutive activation rather than an enhanced CaP sensitivity Interestingly, all three of these mutations, like A843E, lowered the maximal CaP activation compared to wild-type CaR The unique eects seen with the A843E mutation of the CaR lead us to suggest, in keeping with the prevalent model of GPCR activation, that this mutation, without CaP binding, disrupts the inhibitory constraints that prevent G protein coupling We were able, however, to test our hypothesis that the A843E mutation activates the CaR by promoting G protein coupling without requiring CaP binding to the ECD The A843E mutation, when expressed in the context of rhoC-hCaR, still caused constitutive activation supporting the idea that this mutation alters the conformation of the TM7 portion of the receptor in a manner independent of both CaP and the ECD Such a model would predict that there may be other mutations of the TM7 portion of the receptor such as A843E that will cause constitutive activation and that there may also be residues in the postulated interface between ECD and TM7 portions of the receptor which when mutated will prevent receptor activation The response of two dierent missense mutants identied in subjects with ADH, alanine 116 to threonine (A116T) [16] and A843E [10], was compared in this assay with the wild-type hCaR (Fig The A116T mutant, like other activating hCaR mutations studied to date [3,6,7,9], shows no signicant dierence from the wild-type receptor at very low CaP concentrations, but its ECSH is shifted leftward V2-fold The PI assay in the absence of CaP of cells transfected over this range with either wild-type or A116T mutant hCaR cDNAs showed a constant low level of activity Concentration-dependence for the CaP stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis in transiently transfected HEK-293 cells expressing wild-type and activating mutant (A116T and A843E) hCaR cDNAs 3, mutant hCaRs (A116T, A840E, A843K, A843V) were all expressed at levels close to that of the wild-type To determine whether constitutive activation caused by the A843E mutation is due to substitution of A843 or specically requires the substitution by glutamate, we created several addition mutants, substituting A843 with either positively charged lysine (A843K) or uncharged valine (A843V) The PI response of A840E and A843K mutants demonstrated a leftward shift compared to wildtype, whereas the A843V mutant showed a rightward shift compared to wild-type 3, mutant hCaRs (A116T, A840E, A843K, A843V) were all expressed at levels close to that of the wild-type Failure of the maximum PI response of mutant hCaRs (A840E, A843K, A843V) to reach wild-type levels cannot therefore be ascribed to a reduced cell surface expression However, even mutations in the transmembrane domains of the CaR (F788C and L773R in TM5, F806 in TM6) or in the rst extracellular loop (Q681H) have shown an enhanced sensitivity to CaP rather than constitutive activation when expressed [7,10,16] Concentration-dependence for the CaP stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis in transiently transfected HEK-293 cells expressing the wild-type, A843(E, K or V) and A840E mutant hCaR cDNAs We also made another mutant in which a neighboring alanine in the seventh transmembrane domain is substituted by glutamate (A840E) The PI response of A840E and A843K mutants demonstrated a leftward shift compared to wildtype, whereas the A843V mutant showed a rightward shift compared to wild-type 3, mutant hCaRs (A116T, A840E, A843K, A843V) were all expressed at levels close to that of the wild-type Failure of the maximum PI response of mutant hCaRs (A840E, A843K, A843V) to reach wild-type levels cannot therefore be ascribed to a

9224826	To examine the role of this conserved threonine residue in 5-HT1A receptor coupling to Gi/Go proteins, this residue was mutated to alanine (T149A mutant) In both cell lines, the T149A mutant displayed similar agonist affinities as the wild-type receptor In Ltk cells, the T149A 5-HT1A receptor inhibited cAMP accumulation by 30% compared with wild-type (83%) A 2.6-fold increase in intracellular calcium (due to phospholipase C-mediated calcium mobilization) was observed for the wild-type receptor upon the addition of 100 nM 5-HT; whereas the T149A 5-HT1A receptor failed to mediate a calcium mobilization response at equivalent receptor levels to wild-type When transfected in GH4C1 cells, the T149A receptor mutant fully inhibited basal cAMP and partially inhibited Gs-stimulated cAMP accumulation compared with wild-type receptor (57 14% versus 86 2%) In contrast, the T149A 5-HT1A receptor mutant failed to block the influx of calcium induced by calcium channel agonist ( )-Bay K8644, whereas the wild-type 5-HT1A receptor inhibited the calcium influx by 40% To incorporate the T149A mutation into a more convenient vector for transient transfection, the 1.6-kb BstXI/ XbaI of the T149A mutant was subcloned into BstXI/XbaI-cut pcDNA3 (InVitrogen)-DBX (containing the 1.9-kb BamHI/XbaI fragment of wild-type 5-HT1A receptor) and verified by DNA sequencing T149A was generated, eliminating the hydroxyl side chain that may serve as a contact point for G proteins or as a phosphate acceptor site for PKC (Fig We included a previously characterized T343A (i3 loop) 5-HT1A receptor mutant with a more similar receptor level for functional comparisons with the T149A receptor in these cells (24) When expressed in Ltk cells, neither of the T149A mutant clones, the T343A mutant, nor the wild-type receptor significantly inhibited basal (without forskolin) cAMP level Both of the T149A mutants in Ltk cells reduced forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation by 30%, which is significantly less pronounced ( p 0.001) compared with wild-type receptor (Fig This reduction in T149A receptor efficacy may have been due in part to the lower levels of receptor compared with wild-type (Table 1) However, other threonine mutants (e.g., the T343A mutant) retained receptor efficacy when expressed at similar levels (24), suggesting a partial impairment of T149A 5-HT1A receptors in coupling to inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in these cells When expressed in GH4C1 cells, the T149A mutant inhibited basal cAMP levels to the same extent as the wild-type receptor (38 8% versus 33 3%) 2B and Table 2), whereas the T149A mutant decreased VIP-stimulated cAMP accumulation by 57%, which is not significantly different from wild-type Coupling of wild-type and mutant T149A 5-HT1A receptors to Ca2 mobilization in Ltk cells was examined by monitoring [Ca2 ]i in cells loaded with the Ca2 indicator TABLE 1 Binding characteristics of Ltk GH4C1 cells expressing transfected wild-type and mutant 5-HT1A receptors Membranes from clones stably transfected with wild-type or mutant 5-HT1A receptors were prepared and subjected to saturation binding analysis using [3H]DPAT as a selective agonist (see text) Values shown are the mean standard error of data from at least three independent experiments except for Ltk : T149A2 (two experiments) 5-HT1A receptor Bmax Kd pmol/mg of protein nM Ltk : Wild-type 1.64 0.38 2.74 0.38 Ltk : T343Aa 0.62 0.10 7.80 2.50 Ltk : T149A1 0.36 0.06 5.40 0.30 Ltk : T149A2 0.34 0.09 4.30 0.06 GH4: Wild-type 1.10 0.45 5.62 1.50 GH4: T149A 2.71 0.90 3.57 1.10 a Data from Ref Inhibition of cAMP accumulation by wild-type and T149A 5-HT1A receptors in Ltk /GH4C1 cells cAMP accumulation was measured in media harvested from Ltk or GH4C1 cells transfected with wild-type (W.T.) or T149A 5-HT1A receptor cDNAs after the addition of experimental compounds On the other hand, both of the T149A mutant clones (Fig To further document the uncoupling of the T149A mutant from Ca2 signaling, we used transient transfection of Ltk cells with equal amounts of T149A and wild-type 5-HT1A receptor plasmid DNA to express the receptors at equal levels 4), the wild-type receptor coupled to increase [Ca2 ]i by an average of 1.72 0.10-fold basal (five experiments), whereas the T149A mutant elicited no significant increase (1.08 0.07-fold basal;

9927617	Given the fact that MOR1B lacks only one putative phosphorylation site (T394 of MOR1), we replaced this threonine by an alanine and stably expressed the wild-type MOR1 and its T394A mutant in mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2a cells We show that during prolonged [D-Ala2, MePhe4, Gly5-ol]enkephalin exposure (5 h), the T394A receptor mutant desensitized at a slower rate than MOR1 In contrast, T394A is more rapidly removed from the cell surface than MOR1, as determined by flow cytometry using epitope-tagged receptors This fast internalization was followed by immediate resensitization of T394A during 20 min of agonist removal while the wild-type MOR1 remained inactive Similar to MOR1B, rapid internalization and reactivation of T394A may explain its delayed desensitization We provide evidence that the slow desensitizing T394A receptor mutant is subject to rapid endocytosis and reactivation The HindIII restriction site upstream of the ATG start codon as well as the point mutation of T394 to alanine were generated by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis using MOR1/HindIII-primer 5 -TCCGCAGCAAAGCTTCACACCATG-3 and 1A-T394A mutagenesis primer 5 - TTAGGGCAATGGAGCAGCTTCTGC-3 (MWG-Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany) Mutagenesis primer MOR1/HindIII corresponds to 24 nucleotides from 21 up to base position 3, whereas mutagenesis primer 1A-T394A corresponds to 24 nucleotides 1174 to 1197 of the coding sequence of MOR1 Neuro2a cells stably expressing either MOR1 or T394A receptor mutant were grown on poly-L-lysinetreated coverslips overnight Time course of agonist-induced desensitization of MOR1 wild-type and the T394A receptor mutant Asterisk indicates significant difference (p .05) between MOR1 and T394A as determined using analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni test Flow cytometric analysis of MOR1 and T394A internalization Neuro2a cells were stably transfected with cDNAs encoding rat opioid receptors MOR1 or the T394A mutant Displacement-binding experiments of radioactive DAMGO indicated that MOR1 and T394A mutant did not differ significantly with respect to their binding affinity (IC50 810 nM) Surface expression of MOR1 (413 70 fmol/mg protein) in Neuro2a cells was comparable to that of T394A (522 64 fmol/mg protein) as measured in the ligand-binding assay The reduction of forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels by 1 M DAMGO was 56% 7 and 53% 5 for MOR1 and T394A, respectively (mean S.E.M., n 46) DAMGO inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation by about 50% in Neuro2a cells expressing either MOR1 or T394A mutant After 1 h of DAMGO

Neuro2a cells MOR1 (top) and T394A receptor mutant- (bottom) expressing Neuro2a cells were exposed to 1 M DAMGO for the indicated time intervals These data demonstrated that MOR1-expressing cells desensitize faster than those expressing the T394A mutant receptor After 2 min of agonist treatment, only 15% of MOR1 receptor but nearly 30% of the T394A receptor were internalized After 50 min of agonist treatment, 40% of MOR1 and 60% of T394A receptor mutant were internalized To test whether the T394A mutation of the opioid receptor has an effect on agonist-induced receptor endocytosis, MOR1- and T394A-expressing Neuro2a cells were exposed to 1 M DAMGO for 0, 10, 30, and 50 min Although agonist-induced internalization of MOR1 was complete not before 50 min, in most cells internalization of T394A was already complete after 30 min To test the possibility that T394A mutant is constitutively internalized, we compared the internalization extent of MOR1 and T394A mutant in the presence of monensin, which blocks receptor recycling to the cell membrane Figure 4 (top) shows that in the absence of agonist, neither MOR1 nor T394A receptor mutant is internalized, indicating that T394A mutant does not undergo constitutive internalization The agonist-induced internalization of MOR1 and T394A mutant was blockable by sucrose pretreatment (Fig Resensitization of MOR1 and T394A in Neuro2a Cells To investigate whether MOR1 and T394A receptor mutants differ in their resensitization kinetics after complete desensitization, Neuro2a cells expressing either MOR1 or T394A were treated for 5 h with 1 M DAMGO Figure 5 shows that after complete receptor desensitization, only T394A but not MOR1 resensitized during the 20 min of DAMGO withdrawal Resensitized T394A receptors dropped forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation from 4 pmol to 2.5 pmol, whereas the cAMP level of MOR1 receptor-expressing cells remained unchanged at 4 pmol after agonist withdrawal These results suggest that the faster rate of internalization of T394A is associated with accelerated receptor resensitization and redistribution of receptor proteins to the cell surface Comparison of agonist-induced endocytosis of MOR1 and T394A mutant in Neuro2a cells in the presence of recycling blocker monensin (top) or sucrose (bottom) MOR1 and T394A receptor mutant-expressing Neuro2a cells were exposed to 1 M DAMGO for the indicated time intervals In view of the fact that mutation of this T394 into an alanine resulted in a opioid receptor mutant that is also more slowly desensitized than MOR1 (Pak et al., 1997; Koch et al., 1997), it is not unreasonable to speculate that due to the loss of this phosphorylation site, the T394A mutant may become a poor substrate for phosphorylation by GRKs and, hence, more resistant to agonist-induced desensitization In the present study, we provide evidence that also the T394A receptor mutant, in a manner similar to that seen with MOR1B, passes through an accelerated cycle of endocytosis and receptor resensitization which may explain its slow desensitization In the present work we also show that, unlike MOR1B, the T394A receptor mutant does not undergo constitutive internalization, suggesting that the C terminus of MOR1B not only lacks the T394 but appears to contain sequence information that facilitates targeting of the receptor protein to the endocytotic machinery leading to constitutive endocytosis

10617689	In the combined D4-F88V/TMS3 mutants, L-750,667 binding affinity was further decreased, but this decrease was not additive More importantly, the combined D4-F88V/TMS3 mutants had ( )-raclopride and isomethylbutylamiloride binding properties that reverted back to those of the wild-type D4-receptor The D4-M107V mutant, as well as all of the D4-TMS3 cassette mutations centered around methionine 107, bound the highly D4-selective antagonist L-750,667 (Patel et al., 1996), with lower affinity than did the wild-type D4 receptor (Table 3) Although the D4-M107V mutation alone produced only a 3-fold decrease in L-750,667 binding affinity (Table 3), additionally substituting a phenylalanine for the adjacent leucine at position 106 resulted in a more pronounced affinity change (20-fold) (Fig Like L-750,667, the less selective, mixed D1/D4-selective antagonist A-69024 (Kerkman et al., 1989; Burgess and Sibley, 1994) bound the five amino acid cassette D4 mutant centered around and including M107V with moderately lower affinity than the wild-type D4 receptor (10-fold) (Table 3) In contrast to L-750,667, A-69024 bound the D4-M107V mutants with an anomalous 4-fold higher affinity than the wild-type D4 receptor (Table 3) Both ( )-raclopride and ( )-nafadotride bound D4-M107V and associated D4 cassette mutants, which included substitution of leucine 106

the competition curves slopes were distinctly shallow The discordant effects of the D4-M107V and D4-TLMAM105109IFVTL mutants on dopamine and A-69024-binding affinity, the imperfect distinction between extended and compact ligand structures for reciprocal substitutions in both a D4- and a D2-background, and the unusual D4-TMS3 MIA binding profile suggest that residues at the extracellular side of TMS3 are located in a conformationally delicate region In contrast to the D4-F88V mutant, the adjacent D4-L87W mutant had an increased affinity for ligands with extended structures, but had essentially no effect on ligands with compact structures With the exception of the D4-L87W mutant, which had a significantly more D2-like [3H]methylspiperone-binding profile (7-fold), all other D4 mutants bound [3H]methylspiperone with affinities similar to the wild-type D4 receptor background Fold change in Ki (away from wild-type background) pM D4-WT 294 30 1 D4-M107V 138 22 2 D4-TLMAM

group, the Tyr381Phe mutant was made and characterized Initially, the binding of [3H]NMS and [3H]QNB was measured and the pKD values of these ligands for the Tyr381Phe mutation were 9.45 0.08 and 11.19 0.02, respectively Binding of ACh Analogs Tyr381Phe and Tyr381Ala both reduced ACh affinity by 30-fold when compared with wild-type, where ACh had a KD of 17 M (Table 1) However, the trends observed with the Tyr381Phe and Tyr381Ala mutations were similar in that both mutations caused carbachol, ACh-reversed ester, and ACh-N(Et)2 affinities to be reduced by 6- (p .001), 6- (p .001), and 4-fold (p .01), respectively In contrast, tetramethylammonium binding was affected by less than 3-fold when comparing the Tyr381Phe and Tyr381Ala mutant M1 mAChRs to wild-type Interestingly, the binding affinity of the antagonist benzilylcholine was increased by 2-fold (p .05) at the Tyr381Phe mutant and decreased by 3-fold (p .01) at the Tyr381Ala receptor when compared with wild-type Binding of Oxotremorine-M and Pilocarpine The binding affinities of oxotremorine-M and pilocarpine to Tyr381Phe showed a 5- (p .001) and 3-fold (p .05) decrease, respectively, when compared with wild-type (Table 1) However, the binding affinities of the two compounds were similar for the Tyr381Phe mutant (KD 1.5 M), and L-658,903 had an almost 2-fold (p .05) higher binding affinity than L-698,583 for the Tyr381Ala mutant M1 mAChR The binding affinities of the compounds are also similar for the Tyr381Phe mutation (KD 1.4 M) except for L-661,319 and L-693,046, which have 3-fold higher (p .001) or 2-fold lower (p .01) binding affinity By comparing the binding affinities of these compounds for wild-type and Tyr381Phe receptors and so examining the consequences of removal of the Tyr381 hydroxyl group, it can be seen that there may be a trend (p .03) related to the number of nitrogens in the side chain, although the effect is not large Binding Affinity: pIC50 Wild-Type

ring are compared by measuring the change in binding affinity between Tyr381Phe and Tyr381Ala, it can be seen that the number of nitrogens in the side chain is a major determinant of the change measured (p .001) The quinuclidine-based ligands with one nitrogen in the side chain (L-683,355, L-683,356, and L-693,046) all showed results similar to those obtained for ACh; the removal of the Tyr381 hydroxyl group (wild-type to Tyr381Phe) reduced the ligand-binding affinity by 2- (p .01), 3- (p .001), and 4-fold (p .01), respectively, whereas removal of the benzene ring (Tyr381Phe to Tyr381Ala) did not significantly alter the ligand-binding affinity The Tyr381 mutations also affected the binding affinities of these compounds, although a general observation can be made: the change in binding affinity observed between the wild-type and Tyr381Phe mutant, for the atropine-based ligands, tends to be smaller than the change measured between Tyr381Phe and Tyr381Ala At the Tyr381Phe mutation, the 2-fold higher affinities of the quaternary analogs were preserved in the case of atropine (p .05) and ( )scopolamine (p .001), but not homatropine At the Tyr381Phe mutant similar effects

mutant, the increases observed were 100- and 1510-fold, whereas at the Tyr381Ala receptor there were 10and 1230-fold increases The absolute binding affinity of diphenylacetyltropine increased by 2-fold (p .01) and decreased by 10-fold (p .01) at the Tyr381Phe and Tyr381Ala M1 mAChRs when compared with the wild-type value (KD of 8 nM) The results obtained for benztropine, which has the two benzene rings attached to the tropane ring via an ether linkage, show that its binding affinities for wild-type and Tyr381Phe receptors are similar (KD values 400 pM), whereas at the Tyr381Ala M1 mAChR, its binding affinity is reduced 7-fold (p .001) when compared with wild-type This observation of increased or unchanged affinities for binding to the Tyr381Phe mutant differs from the general trend, i.e., the Tyr381Phe mutation causes a decrease in the binding affinity of most ligands when compared with their binding affinity for the wild-type receptor Tyr381Phe and Tyr381Ala caused a 70- and 2750-fold reduction in ACh potency in the functional response, respectively, when compared with the wild-type response (EC50 100 nM), without reducing the maximum response The effect of the Tyr381Phe mutation on the functional response caused by binding of ACh-reversed ester and tetramethylammonium was to produce a 20- and 7-fold (p .001) reduction in potency when compared with wild-type Although the maximum response produced by ACh-reversed ester binding to Tyr381Phe was similar to its wild-type response, tetramethylammonium showed an almost 2-fold decrease (p .01) in the maximum response elicited from the Tyr381Phe mutant compared with the wild-type receptor The Tyr381Phe mutation reduced the potency of the functional response produced by L-698,583 and L-658,903 by 90and 30-fold, respectively, although both compounds still gave a similar maximal response to that evoked by ACh Wild-Type Tyr381Phe Tyr381Ala pEC50 % Responsea pEC50 % Responsea pEC50 % Responsea ACh 6.99

and 5.2 0.6 (332 32 dpm), respectively The other observation that can be made is that the Tyr381Ala mutation affects compound efficacy to a larger extent ( 10-fold) than Tyr381Phe when compared with the wild-type receptor Additional characterization of the Tyr381Ala mutant, combined with studies of Tyr381Phe, gave additional insight into the function of Tyr381 % Signaling Efficacy Wild-Type

and Asn382Ala are shown in Fig Immunocytochemistry showing the expression of wild-type, Tyr381Ala, and Asn382Ala M1 mAChRs transiently expressed in COS-7 cells An antibody directed against a carboxy-terminal epitope was used to probe the transient expression of wild-type (A), Tyr381Ala (B), and Asn382Ala (C) M1 mAChRs in COS-7 cells Analysis of the reaction product by using a Molecular Dynamics laser scanning densitometer and Image-Quant software revealed that Tyr381Ala and Asn382Ala expression was 44 7 and 24 5%, respectively, relative to wild-type The ACh binding affinity for Asn382Ala could not be calculated because no measurable amounts of radioligand bound to this mutant relative to wild-type (pEC50 6.99 0.08) except for Asn382AladLoop (#) that was expressed relative to dLoop (pEC50 6.02 0.06) The ACh binding affinity for the Asn382Ala-dLoop mutant was used in the analysis of Asn382Ala The expression of Asn382Ala was treated as half of Tyr381Ala expression, as suggested by the immunocytochemistry data, i.e., 8% of wild-type () The efficacy value calculated for Asn382Ala-dLoop () was compared with dLoop (Lu et al., 1997) Asn382Ala was studied in context of the dLoop mutation (Asn382Ala-dLoop) gave a 6-fold (p .001) reduction in ACh binding affinity when compared with wild-type Interestingly, the Asn382Ala mutant was able to produce a phosphoinositide response whose maximum was similar to that of the wild-type receptor and showed a 40-fold reduction in ACh potency In contrast the estimated efficacy for the Asn382Ala mutant was the same as that of the wild-type receptor, either in the context of the dLoop construct (where its expression was 80%) or the full-length receptor (where its expression was estimated to be 8%) As reported previously, we confirmed that treatment of the cells with propylbenzilylcholine mustard to block 90% of the functional receptors (Lu et al., 1997) caused an approximately 10-fold decrease in the potency of ACh in phosphoinositide turnover experiments, and thus reduced the potency ratio between the Asn382Ala mutant and wild-type receptors to 2-fold (data not shown) The reduction in receptor expression levels caused by Tyr381Ala and Asn382Ala suggest that they may also form intramolecular interactions that stabilize receptor folding (Lu et al., 1997) The mutations that did affect the receptor's response to ACh were Tyr381Ala, Asn382Ala (Asn382Ala-dLoop), and Leu386Ala However, Asn382Ala did not affect ACh efficacy, implying that Asn382 does not mediate the process of receptor activation by ACh The ligand-binding data for Asn382 was determined using the Asn382Ala-dLoop mutant Asn382Ala has undiminished signaling efficacy 1031 showed that the Asn507Ser mutant produced a receptor with constitutive activity Tyr381Ala produced a 40-fold reduction in ACh affinity and a 50-fold reduction in ACh-signaling efficacy The roles of the hydroxyl group and benzene ring of Tyr381 were probed further by comparative analysis of the Tyr381Phe and Tyr381Ala mutants using three series of ligands: ACh analogs, azanorbornane- and quinuclidine-based ligands, and atropine analogs However, there was no measurable specific binding of [3H]NMS to Tyr381Ala and Asn382Ala, indicating a KD in excess of 10 8 M Interestingly, when probed with [3H]QNB, Tyr381Ala showed unaltered affinity (2.3 10 11 M) but a reduced number of binding sites (around 16%) relative to wild-type A competition ligand-binding experiment using unlabeled NMS to inhibit the binding of [3H]QNB showed that the KD of NMS binding to Tyr381Ala was 8.7 10 8 M This implies that when low concentrations of [3H]NMS are used there is a 1000-fold reduction in specific binding to Tyr381Ala relative to the wild-type Immunocytochemistry Tyr381Ala and Asn382Ala were the only two alanine-substitution mutations that affected [3H]NMS and [3H]QNB binding Analysis of the reaction product by using a Molecular Dynamics (Sunnyvale, CA)

wild-type Further Characterization of the Role of Tyr381 Of the seven positions characterized by alanine substitution, Tyr381Ala gave the largest effects on ACh binding and the ACh-induced functional

binding affinity between Tyr381Phe and Tyr381Ala, it can be seen that the number of nitrogens in the side chain is a major determinant of the change measured (p .001) The quinuclidine-based ligands with one nitrogen in the side chain (L-683,355, L-683,356, and L-693,046) all showed results similar to those obtained for ACh; the removal of the Tyr381 hydroxyl group (wild-type to Tyr381Phe) reduced the ligand-binding affinity by 2- (p .01), 3- (p .001), and 4-fold (p .01), respectively, whereas removal of the benzene ring (Tyr381Phe to Tyr381Ala) did not significantly alter the ligand-binding affinity The Tyr381 mutations also affected the binding affinities of these compounds, although a general observation can be made: the change in binding affinity observed between the wild-type and Tyr381Phe mutant, for the atropine-based ligands, tends to be smaller than the change measured between Tyr381Phe and Tyr381Ala These differences were abolished by the Tyr381Ala mutation

whereas at the Tyr381Ala receptor there were 10and 1230-fold increases The absolute binding affinity of diphenylacetyltropine increased by 2-fold (p .01) and decreased by 10-fold (p .01) at the Tyr381Phe and Tyr381Ala M1 mAChRs when compared with the wild-type value (KD of 8 nM) The results obtained for benztropine, which has the two benzene rings attached to the tropane ring via an ether

5.5 0.3 (379 30 dpm), and 5.2 0.6 (332 32 dpm), respectively Tyr381Ala mutation had an effect on the maximal response produced by L-658,903 (reducing it to 50% of the wild-type response), whereas L-698,583 was able to give a larger maximal response equivalent to 118% of the wild-type ACh response However, the potencies of L-698,583 and L-658,903 were reduced by the Tyr381Ala mutation 10,000- and 2,700fold, respectively, when compared with their potencies at the wild-type receptor The potency of L-658,903 in the functional response evoked by the Tyr381Ala mutant appears to be 5-fold lower than the binding affinity However, L-658,903 is a weak partial agonist at Tyr381Ala, therefore the results from the phosphoinositide turnover experiments have relatively large errors The other observation that can be made is that the Tyr381Ala mutation affects compound efficacy to a larger extent ( 10-fold) than Tyr381Phe when compared with the wild-type receptor The reduction in receptor expression levels caused by Tyr381Ala and Asn382Ala suggest that they may also form intramolecular interactions that stabilize receptor folding (Lu et al., 1997) The mutations that did affect the receptor's response to ACh were Tyr381Ala, Asn382Ala (Asn382Ala-dLoop), and Leu386Ala In contrast, a very large effect on receptor function resulted from the Tyr381Ala mutation, indicating that Tyr381 plays a major role in M1 mAChR activation Additional characterization of the Tyr381Ala mutant, combined with studies of Tyr381Phe, gave additional insight into the function of Tyr381 % Signaling

response to ACh were Tyr381Ala, Asn382Ala (Asn382Ala-dLoop), and Leu386Ala A similar observation was made for Asn507Ala (Bluml et al., 1994) in the M3 mAChR There are no data for the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) itself, but in the rat M3 mAChR, mutation of Tyr506 to Phe (corresponding to Tyr381 in the M1 mAChR) has suggested that the tyrosine hydroxyl group is important in agonist (but not antagonist) binding and, in addition, in determining the signaling efficacy of the agonist-stimulated phosphoinositide response (Wess et al., 1991, 1992)

Most remarkably, Y308F responded significantly better to agonist stimulation The finding that Asp128 mutants behave differently from the Y308F receptor suggests that breakage of the proposed Asp128-Tyr308 hydrogen bond is not the only event induced by the site-directed mutagenesis Therefore our finding that the Y308F mutation reduces opioid binding affinity parallels what was observed for muscarinic and adenosine receptors We also found constitutive activity at the Y308F receptor, as described previously for homologous mutations in rhodopsine and adrenergic receptors (see above), but the enhanced agonist-induced stimulation in Y308F receptor contrasts with findings at angiotensin AT1A, m3, and adenosine mutant receptors Mutation into phenylalanine (Y533F) clearly reduced agonist affinity, but maximal stimulation of inositol triphosphate hydrolysis was comparable with that of the WT receptor (53, 54)

were transfected with a plasmid encoding the wild-type CXCR4, wild-type CCR5, or CXCR4-D187A mutant coreceptor linked to vaccinia virus promoter and infected with vCB21R-LacZ and vCB-3 (CD4) Also in support of this notion, we have observed that the mouse monoclonal antibody 12G5, which binds to elements of the ecl-2 of CXCR4, inhibited R5 Env-mediated fusion with the D187A mutant CXCR4 coreceptor (data not shown) These observations, together with the fusion results obtained with CXCR4D187A, suggest that there is an existing underlying conserved framework of elements between CXCR4 and CCR5 for their coreceptor activity and prompted us to examine the homologous region in ecl-2 of the CCR5 coreceptor corresponding to the Asp187 position of CXCR4 In addition, a D187S mutation was examined (15), which would be the direct opposite of the present CCR5-S179D mutant, and not surprisingly its effects were similar to CXCR4D187A, having little effect on X4 IIIB Env usage while moderately enhancing R5 Ba-L and ADA usage Taken together, these observations suggested that there were existing conserved elements between CXCR4 and CCR5 for their respective coreceptor activities, and they prompted us to further examine the CXCR4D187A mutation with respect to a broader range of R5 HIV-1 primary isolates and to examine the homologous region in ecl-2 of the CCR5 coreceptor corresponding to the Asp187 position of CXCR4 In regard to the mutations that confer on, or reveal in, CXCR4 an ability to be employed as a coreceptor by otherwise CCR5-dependent HIV-1 Envs, it was the CXCR4-D187A ecl-2 mutation that had the most potent effect Although it was the clade B R5 isolates, both laboratory-adapted and primary, that were most capable of utilizing CXCR4-D187A, there were some other primary isolate R5 Envs from additional clades that could as well (Fig Also of note is that CXCR4 is the principal receptor for the related feline immunodeficiency virus retrovirus (62), and whereas the D187A CXCR4 mutation can expand coreceptor activity for HIV-1 R5 Envs, this alteration completely ablated the ability of feline immunodeficiency virus to employ it as its primary receptor (63) 1 and 6), where neither the CXCR4-D187A mutant nor the CCR5-S179D mutant were universally effective in their altered coreceptor activities In addition, several point mutations, N11A and R30A in the NH2 terminus and N176A, D187A, and D193A in ecl-2, were noted to enhance the ability of CXCR4 to serve as a coreceptor for otherwise CCR5-dependent R5 HIV-1 isolates, while retaining full function for X4 and R5X4 isolates RESULTS Charge Deletion in ecl-2 and the Expansion of CXCR4 Coreceptor Activity--Previously, we demonstrated that several alanine substitution point mutations in CXCR4 (N11A, R30A, D187A, D193A) either alone or in combination could allow CXCR4 to serve as a functional coreceptor for prototypic R5 HIV-1 clade B Envs while retaining its coreceptor activity for X4 and R5X4 HIV-1 clade B Envs (12) In addition, a D187S mutation was examined (15), which would be the direct opposite of the present CCR5-S179D mutant, and not surprisingly its effects were similar to CXCR4D187A, having little effect on X4 IIIB Env usage while moderately enhancing R5 Ba-L and ADA usage Two mutant CCR5 constructs were prepared; one was a double alanine substitution of both serine residues at positions 179 and 180 (S179A/S180A), and the other was substitution of the serine residue at position 179 with aspartic acid (S179D), aspartic acid being the negatively charged amino acid that exists in the homologous ecl-2 position of CXCR4 We first examined the ability of the single (S179D) and double (S179A/S180A) mutant CCR5 coreceptors to support Env-mediated membrane fusion by several vaccinia virus expressed R5 and R5X4 HIV-1 Envs (Fig The dotted line represents U373-MG-CD4 /CCR5 S179A/S180A cells (Mean fluorescence intensity 94%) In addition, neither the single (S179D) nor double (S179A/S180A) CCR5 mutant enhanced any X4 HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion or virus entry (data not shown) In no instances did the (S179A/S180A) CCR5 mutant appear unable to support fusion by any of the Envs examined In addition, several point mutations, N11A and R30A in the NH2 terminus and N176A, D187A, and D193A in ecl-2, were noted to enhance the ability of CXCR4 to serve as a coreceptor for otherwise CCR5-dependent R5 HIV-1 isolates, while retaining full function for X4 and R5X4 isolates RESULTS Charge Deletion in ecl-2 and the Expansion of CXCR4 Coreceptor Activity--Previously, we demonstrated that several alanine substitution point mutations in CXCR4 (N11A, R30A, D187A, D193A) either alone or in combination could allow CXCR4 to serve as a functional coreceptor for prototypic R5 HIV-1 clade B Envs while retaining its coreceptor activity for X4 and R5X4 HIV-1 clade B Envs (12) Two mutant CCR5 constructs were prepared; one was a double alanine substitution of both serine residues at positions 179 and 180 (S179A/S180A), and the other was substitution of the serine residue at position 179 with aspartic acid (S179D), aspartic acid being the negatively charged amino acid that exists in the homologous ecl-2 position of CXCR4 We first examined the ability of the single (S179D) and double (S179A/S180A) mutant CCR5 coreceptors to support Env-mediated membrane fusion by several vaccinia virus expressed R5 and R5X4 HIV-1 Envs (Fig While the prototypic clade B R5 Envs JR-FL and ADA were able to utilize both mutants, two dual tropic clade B R5X4 Envs (SF2 and 89.6) were clearly unable to employ the S179D charge insertion CCR5 mutant when compared with the fusion signals obtained with wild-type CCR5 versus vector control However, a vaccinia virusexpressed clade E R5 Env (CM235) was also examined in this experiment and was found to be completely defective in its ability to employ the CCR5-S179D mutant for fusion (Fig In addition, a D187S mutation was examined (15), which would be the direct opposite of the present CCR5-S179D mutant, and not surprisingly its effects were similar to CXCR4D187A, having little effect on X4 IIIB Env usage while moderately enhancing R5 Ba-L and ADA usage The mixed line represents U373-MG-CD4 /CCR5S179D cells (Mean fluorescence intensity 75%) We observed results similar to the cell fusion data, where both CCR5 mutant constructs had approximately wild-type levels of coreceptor activity with the R5 JR-FL Env, while the single CCR5-S179D mutant was significantly defective in providing coreceptor function for both the R5X4 Envs 89.6 and SF2, exhibiting 12 logs less activity in comparison with wild-type CCR5 In addition, neither the single (S179D) nor double (S179A/S180A) CCR5 mutant enhanced any X4 HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion or virus entry (data not shown) Charge Introduction into ecl-2 and the Impairment of CCR5 Coreceptor Activity for Primary Isolate R5 Env-mediated Fusion--Because of the dramatic effect of the S179D mutation in CCR5 in abolishing fusion by the R5 CM235 Env, we further examined both CCR5 mutants for their ability to support Envmediated fusion with an expanded battery of primary isolate R5 Envs, including those from alternate HIV-1 clades We observed that the inhibitory effect of the S179D mutation in CCR5 was evident across several of these clades (Fig Consistent with the results obtained with the prototypic clade B R5 Envs (JR-FL and ADA), the CCR5-S179D mutant had near equivalent coreceptor activity with the prototypic clade B R5 Env Ba-L and with two of four primary isolate clade B R5 Envs (Fig However, there were two clade B Envs that exhibited some difficulty in employing the CCR5-S179D coreceptor; the HA301593.1 clade B R5 Env was fusion-negative with CCR5S179D, while another (91US005.11) had fusion activity reduced by 50% when compared with wild-type CCR5 The inhibitory effects of the S179D CCR5 mutation were observed with somewhat more consistency with Envs across the other HIV-1 clades, where the Env-mediated fusion was either completely abolished or inhibited anywhere from 50 to 75% Two clade F/B mosaics (93BR019.10 and 93BR019.4), both of which are all gp120 of clade F, and the clade F isolate Env 93BR029.2 were all significantly inhibited in an ability to utilize the CCR5-S179D mutant The CCR5-S179D mutant was also defective in supporting fusion mediated by the clade G R5 Env (92UG975.10) Interestingly, an additional clade E R5 Env (92TH022.4) appeared unaffected by the S179D CCR mutation, while the CM235 clade E Env was again unable to employ the CCR5-S179D mutant as a functional coreceptor In a separate experiment, an additional clade E R5 Env (CM243) was also found incapable of utilizing the CCR5-S179D mutant (data not shown) There are several possible explanations for how the S179D CCR5 mutation affects the Env-CD4-coreceptor interaction required for the membrane fusion process An alternative speculation that might be made is that this mutation disrupts the CCR5-CD4 interaction, but both of these notions seem less likely, since some R5 Envs are still capable of employing CCR5-S179D The single S179D mutation, which introduces the aspartic acid residue present at the homologous position in CXCR4, is possibly disrupting CCR5's ability to correctly associate with certain Envs (Fig 1 and 6), where neither the CXCR4-D187A mutant nor the CCR5-S179D mutant were universally effective in their altered coreceptor activities Two mutant CCR5 constructs were prepared; one was a double alanine substitution of both serine residues at positions 179 and 180 (S179A/S180A), and the other was substitution of the serine residue at position 179 with aspartic acid (S179D), aspartic acid being the negatively charged amino acid that exists in the homologous ecl-2 position of CXCR4 We first examined the ability of the single (S179D) and double (S179A/S180A) mutant CCR5 coreceptors to support Env-mediated membrane fusion by several vaccinia virus expressed R5 and R5X4 HIV-1 Envs (Fig The dotted line represents U373-MG-CD4 /CCR5 S179A/S180A cells (Mean fluorescence intensity 94%) In addition, neither the single (S179D) nor double (S179A/S180A) CCR5 mutant enhanced any X4 HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion or virus entry (data not shown) In no instances did the (S179A/S180A) CCR5 mutant appear unable to support fusion by any of the Envs examined 
9341139	In contrast, resensitization of a sequestration-impaired 2AR mutant (Y326A) was reestablished following the overexpression of either GRK2 or -arrestin 1 Additionally using a sequestration-defective 2-adrenergic receptor ( 2AR) mutant (Y326A), GRK-mediated phosphorylation, and -arrestin binding, the same molecular intermediates required for receptor desensitization were demonstrated to initiate 2AR endocytosis (12, 13) The effect of GRK2, -arrestin 1, and the -arrestin 1-V53D dominant negative mutant on 2AR and 2AR-Y326A mutant sequestration and the co-immunoprecipitation of -arrestin 1 and -arrestin 1-V53D with the 2AR A, 12CA5 epitopetagged wild-type and Y326A mutant 2ARs were transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells in a pcDNA1-Amp expression vector together with 10 g of empty vector (control), 5 g of pcDNA1-Amp GRK2, 10 g of pcMV5 -arrestin 1, 10 g of pcDNA1-Amp -arrestin 1-V53D, or 5 g of GRK2 with 10 g of either -arrestin 1 or -arrestin 1-V53D Effect of -Arrestins on 2AR Sequestration--To confirm that the effects of -arrestin 1-V53D on 2AR dephosphorylation and resensitization were the consequence of its ability to block 2AR endocytosis, we reexamined the effects of GRK and - arrestin regulatory proteins on both wild-type 2AR and Y326A mutant receptor sequestration As expected (12, 13), GRK2 and -arrestin 1 overexpression rescued the sequestration phenotype of the Y326A mutant receptor, whereas overexpression of -arrestin 1-V53D not only impaired wild-type 2AR sequestration but blocked GRK2 phosphorylation-mediated rescue of FIG -Arrestin, Endocytosis, and 2AR Resensitization 27008 Y326A receptor sequestration (Fig Effect of -Arrestins and GRK2 on 2AR-Y326A Mutant Resensitization--The work implicating GRK-mediated phosphorylation and -arrestin binding in 2AR sequestration has stemmed from the characterization of a 2AR mutant (Y326A), which desensitizes but neither sequesters nor resensitizes following agonist exposure (12, 13, 32, 38) Therefore, to determine whether impaired GRK-phosphorylation and -arrestin binding also underlie the resensitization defect of the Y326A receptor mutant, we tested whether overexpression of GRK2 and/or -arrestin 1 would result in a gain of function with respect to the ability of this mutant receptor to resensitize The 2AR-Y326A mutant maximally stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in membranes prepared from HEK 293 cells when compared with the wild-type 2AR (11 1% of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity for both receptors) When expressed alone, the Y326A receptor desensitized (19 3% decrease in Vmax) but did not resensitize (Fig Interestingly, overexpression of GRK2 and -arrestin 1 either alone or together not only enhanced Y326A receptor desensitization (33 3, 31 5, and 41 4% decrease in Vmax, respectively) but also rescued the ability of the receptor mutant to resensitize (Fig However, while overexpression of -arrestin 1-V53D either without or with GRK2 enhanced Y326A receptor desensitization (33 3 and 33 1% decrease in Vmax, respectively), the -arrestin dominant negative mutant did not support Y326A receptor resensitization and blocked GRK2-mediated rescue of Y326A mutant receptor resensitization (Fig Therefore, the Y326A mutant resensitization phenotype is probably the consequence of impaired interactions with GRKs and -arrestins (1214, 38) Effect of GRK2, -arrestin 1, and -arrestin 1-V53D on the desensitization and resensitization of 2AR-Y326A mutantstimulated adenylyl cyclase activity HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected to overexpress the 2AR-Y326A mutant in the absence (2220 870 fmol/mg protein) (A) or the presence of cotransfected GRK2 (2450 390 fmol/mg protein) (B), -arrestin 1 cDNA (2040 100 fmol/mg protein) (C), -arrestin 1-V53D cDNA (1910 120 fmol/mg protein) (D), GRK2 and -arrestin 1 cDNA (1470 220 fmol/mg protein) (E) or GRK2 and -arrestin 1-V53D (1490 340 fmol/mg protein) (F) The Vmax and EC50 values for 2AR-Y326A mutant-mediated adenylyl cyclase activation were 62 6 pmol/min/mg protein and 72 9 nM, respectively, and were not affected by the co-expression of GRK and -arrestin regulatory proteins Not only could wild-type 2AR dephosphorylation and resensitization be inhibited by a sequestration dominant negative -arrestin, but Y326A receptor mutant resensitization could be rescued by the FIG The capacity of the -arrestin 1-V53D mutant to inhibit 2AR resensitization as well as to enhance Y326A receptor desensitization without supporting its resensitization indicates that the desensitization and resensitization functions of - arrestin are dissociable Moreover, the role of GRK2-mediated phosphorylation in GPCR sequestration and resensitization is probably independent of its role in receptor desensitization, considering that co-expression of -arrestin 1-V53D with GRK2 restored phosphorylation of the Y326A receptor mutant (12, 13) and enhanced its desensitization but did not rescue its resensitization (Fig This idea is further supported by the observation that -arrestin expression can reestablish Y326A mutant receptor resensitization in the absence of GRK-mediated phosphorylation (Fig The observation that GRK overexpression rescued 2ARY326A mutant phosphorylation and reestablished its resensitization in the absence of supplemented -arrestins suggests that differences in the endogenous expression levels of GRKs may also influence the relative ability of receptors to sequester and resensitize This hypothesis arises from the observation that over the time period being tested (30 min) the 2AR-Y326A mutant, which does not serve as a substrate for GRK-mediated phosphorylation (12, 13), still desensitizes as the consequence of PKA phosphorylation (12) but does not resensitize Potentially, this same conformational change in the receptor may be required for resensitization of the PKAphosphorylated Y326A mutant receptors Unfortunately, it was not possible to determine whether sequestration was required for the dephosphorylation of PKA-phosphorylated receptors due to the extremely low level of PKA-mediated 2AR-Y326A phosphorylation in HEK 293 cells (Refs The overexpression of either the -arrestin 1-V53D dominant negative inhibitor of 2AR sequestration or dynamin I-K44A to block clathrin-coated vesicle-mediated endocytosis impaired both 2AR dephosphorylation and resensitization -Arrestin Co-immunoprecipitation--HEK 293 cells were transfected with FLAG epitope-tagged 2AR with or without either -arrestin 1 or -arrestin 1-V53D The effect of -arrestin 1 and -arrestin 1-V53D on 2AR phosphorylation and dephosphorylation HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected to overexpress the 2AR in the absence (890 150 fmol/mg protein) or presence of either coexpressed -arrestin 1 (1050 220 fmol/mg protein) or -arrestin 1-V53D (650 140 fmol/mg protein) RESULTS Effect of -Arrestins on 2AR Dephosphorylation--We have reported that overexpression of -arrestin 1-V53D, a dominant negative inhibitor of 2AR sequestration, increased the extent of agonist-induced 2AR phosphorylation, suggesting that - arrestin might play a role in 2AR dephosphorylation and resensitization (13) To begin to test this question, the effect of overexpressing either wild-type -arrestin or -arrestin 1V53D on 2AR dephosphorylation was examined in HEK 293 cells In contrast, -arrestin 1-V53D not only increased the extent of agonistinduced 2AR phosphorylation (137 14% of control 2AR phosphorylation) but significantly impaired the ability of the receptor to be dephosphorylated (28 12% of matched control) (Fig While complete inhibition of 2AR dephosphorylation was not observed in the presence of -arrestin 1-V53D, the absolute value of 2AR phosphorylation remained 95 9% of control 2AR phosphorylation Effect of -arrestin 1 and -arrestin 1-V53D on the desensitization and resensitization of 2AR-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity HEK 293 cells were transfected to overexpress the 2AR in the absence (1120 290 fmol/mg protein) (A) or presence of either coexpressed -arrestin 1 (1280 730 fmol/mg protein) (B) or -arrestin 1-V53D (1170 340 fmol/mg protein) (C) The Vmax and EC50 values for 2ARmediated adenylyl cyclase activation were 30 3 pmol/min/mg protein and 31 2 nM, respectively and were not affected by the overexpression of either -arrestin 1 or -arrestin 1-V53D The effect of GRK2, -arrestin 1, and the -arrestin 1-V53D dominant negative mutant on 2AR and 2AR-Y326A mutant sequestration and the co-immunoprecipitation of -arrestin 1 and -arrestin 1-V53D with the 2AR A, 12CA5 epitopetagged wild-type and Y326A mutant 2ARs were transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells in a pcDNA1-Amp expression vector together with 10 g of empty vector (control), 5 g of pcDNA1-Amp GRK2, 10 g of pcMV5 -arrestin 1, 10 g of pcDNA1-Amp -arrestin 1-V53D, or 5 g of GRK2 with 10 g of either -arrestin 1 or -arrestin 1-V53D B, polyclonal -arrestin 1 antibody immunoblot of the agonist-dependent co-immunoprecipitation of -arrestins with FLAG epitope-tagged 2AR in the absence (CON) or presence of either overexpressed -arrestin 1 ( arr1) or -arrestin 1-V53D (V53D) following chemical cross-linking as described under "Experimental Procedures." -Arrestin, Endocytosis, and 2AR Resensitization 27007 whether normal -arrestin function and receptor dephosphorylation were absolutely required for 2AR resensitization, the ability of the 2AR to both desensitize and resensitize in the presence of either wild-type or V53D mutant -arrestin was tested in HEK 293 cells While the overexpression of either wild-type or V53D mutant -arrestins did not affect the ability of the 2AR to desensitize (48 4 and 36 1% decrease in Vmax, respectively; 2.3- and 1.3-fold rightward shift in the EC50, respectively) (Fig 2, B and C), overexpression of -arrestin 1-V53D impaired the recovery of the Vmax for 2AR-mediated adenylyl cyclase activation by 70% (Fig Consequently, by virtue of its ability to impair 2AR endocytosis, -arrestin 1-V53D acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of both 2AR dephosphorylation and resensitization Effect of -Arrestins on 2AR Sequestration--To confirm that the effects of -arrestin 1-V53D on 2AR dephosphorylation and resensitization were the consequence of its ability to block 2AR endocytosis, we reexamined the effects of GRK and - arrestin regulatory proteins on both wild-type 2AR and Y326A mutant receptor sequestration As expected (12, 13), GRK2 and -arrestin 1 overexpression rescued the sequestration phenotype of the Y326A mutant receptor, whereas overexpression of -arrestin 1-V53D not only impaired wild-type 2AR sequestration but blocked GRK2 phosphorylation-mediated rescue of FIG The lack of complete blockade of 2AR endocytosis by -arrestin 1-V53D probably underlies the observation that some receptor dephosphorylation and resensitization occurs in its presence (see Figs To test whether the mutant -arrestin bound the 2AR, we examined whether both wild-type -arrestin 1 and -arrestin 1-V53D could be co-immunoprecipitated in an agonist-dependent manner with a FLAG epitope-tagged 2AR Consistent with results obtained using purified 2AR and in vitro translated -arrestins (37), co-immunoprecipitation of both - arrestin 1 and -arrestin 1-V53D was observed in the absence of agonist stimulation, but the amount of each -arrestin immunoprecipitated was substantially increased following agonist stimulation (Fig These results indicate that -arrestin 1-V53D exhibits the capacity to interact with the 2AR, albeit less effectively than wild type -arrestin However, while overexpression of -arrestin 1-V53D either without or with GRK2 enhanced Y326A receptor desensitization (33 3 and 33 1% decrease in Vmax, respectively), the -arrestin dominant negative mutant did not support Y326A receptor resensitization and blocked GRK2-mediated rescue of Y326A mutant receptor resensitization (Fig Effect of GRK2, -arrestin 1, and -arrestin 1-V53D on the desensitization and resensitization of 2AR-Y326A mutantstimulated adenylyl cyclase activity HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected to overexpress the 2AR-Y326A mutant in the absence (2220 870 fmol/mg protein) (A) or the presence of cotransfected GRK2 (2450 390 fmol/mg protein) (B), -arrestin 1 cDNA (2040 100 fmol/mg protein) (C), -arrestin 1-V53D cDNA (1910 120 fmol/mg protein) (D), GRK2 and -arrestin 1 cDNA (1470 220 fmol/mg protein) (E) or GRK2 and -arrestin 1-V53D (1490 340 fmol/mg protein) (F) The capacity of the -arrestin 1-V53D mutant to inhibit 2AR resensitization as well as to enhance Y326A receptor desensitization without supporting its resensitization indicates that the desensitization and resensitization functions of - arrestin are dissociable Moreover, the role of GRK2-mediated phosphorylation in GPCR sequestration and resensitization is probably independent of its role in receptor desensitization, considering that co-expression of -arrestin 1-V53D with GRK2 restored phosphorylation of the Y326A receptor mutant (12, 13) and enhanced its desensitization but did not rescue its resensitization (Fig The overexpression of either the -arrestin 1-V53D dominant negative inhibitor of 2AR sequestration or dynamin I-K44A to block clathrin-coated vesicle-mediated endocytosis impaired both 2AR dephosphorylation and resensitization Dynamin mutants defective in GTP binding, such as dynamin I-K44A, specifically block clathrinmediated endocytosis (2123) In addition, we examine, using dynamin I-K44A as an inhibitor of CCV-mediated endocytosis, whether 2AR resensitization is dependent upon an intact CCV endocytic pathway The effect of dynamin I-K44A on 2AR sequestration and 2AR-stimulated whole cell adenylyl cyclase activity in HEK 293 cells 12CA5 epitope-tagged 2ARs were transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells in a pcDNA1-Amp expression vector together with 3 g of empty pCMV5 vector (control) (984 191 fmol receptor/mg protein) or 3 g of pCB1 rat dynamin I-K44A (1317 223 fmol receptor/mg protein) Expression of dynamin I-K44A was monitored by immunoblot using an antibody for dynamin I (49) B, the maximal 2AR-stimulated percentage conversion of [3H]cAMP was 2.03 0.09 in the absence and 2.38 0.03 in the presence of dynamin I-K44A The effect of dynamin I-K44A on the desensitization and resensitization of 2AR-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in HEK 293 cells HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected to overexpress 2ARs in the absence (803 109 fmol/mg protein) (A) or presence (1206 156 fmol/mg protein) (B) of 3 g of cotransfected dynamin I-K44A in pCB1 The EC50 values for 2AR-mediated adenylyl cyclase activation were 54 10 and 39 7 nM, respectively, in the absence and presence of overexpressed dynamin I-K44A C, cells transfected with 2ARs in the absence (q) or presence (E) of dynamin I-K44A were desensitized with 2 M isoproterenol for different periods of time (0 45 min) at 37 C in serum-free media and washed Effect of Dynamin I-K44A on 2AR Function--Because we have demonstrated that -arrestins target GPCRs to CCVs (14), we tested whether 2AR dephosphorylation and resensitization were dependent upon an intact CCV pathway To do this, we examined the effects of the overexpression of dynamin I-K44A on 2AR signaling, sequestration, dephosphorylation, and resensitization Dynamin I-K44A not only inhibited the maximum extent of agonist-promoted 2AR internalization by 64 4% (t 45 min) in HEK 293 cells but reduced the rate of 2AR sequestration as judged by the slope of the curves at t 0 (Fig Moreover, dynamin I-K44A had no effect on the capacity of the 2AR to signal through adenylyl cyclase, indicating that the effect of dynamin I-K44A on 2AR internalization is independent of receptor signaling (Fig In contrast, overexpression of dynamin I-K44A not only enhanced 2AR desensitization (42 2 versus 24 2% decrease in maximal response in control cells) but also abolished the resensitization of 2AR-mediated adenylyl cyclase activation as measured by the recovery in Vmax (Fig Overexpression of dynamin I-K44A increased the extent of 2AR desensitization at all time points tested (Fig To further characterize whether the inhibition of 2AR resensitization by dynamin I-K44A was the consequence of impaired 2AR dephosphorylation, we examined the effect of dynamin I-K44A overexpression on both the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of 2ARs expressed in HEK 293 cells In the absence of dynamin I-K44A, phosphorylation of the 2AR was observed following agonist stimulation with 10 M isoproterenol for 10 min (Fig Consistent with the observed increase in 2AR desensitization, overexpression of dynamin I-K44A with the 2AR significantly increased the maximal extent of 2AR phosphorylation (191 40% of control 2AR phosphorylation) (Fig In contrast, dynamin I-K44A significantly blocked 2AR dephosphorylation (27 6% dephosphorylation of matched control) (Fig The maximal extent of 2AR phosphorylation in the presence of dynamin I-K44A remained higher (141 33%) than control 2AR phosphorylation even when the cells were allowed to recover for 15 min in the absence of agonist (Fig The effect of dynamin I-K44A on 2AR phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in HEK 293 cells 12CA5 epitope-tagged 2ARs were transfected into HEK 293 cells with (1070 140 fmol/mg protein) or without (890 150 fmol/mg protein) dynamin I-K44A Using dynamin I-K44A, the present study implicates CCVs and consequently receptor internalization as a critical step in mediating 2AR resensitization

The dissociation of the fluorescent ligand can be followed over time *, kinetic data for both the D71A and R123G mutant receptors could only be fit to a single exponential rate suggesting an absence of the initial slow dissociation rate for these receptors (mean S.E.) The R123G mutant FPR represents an interesting intermediate However, our recent studies in HEK cells suggested that the FPR could internalize in an arrestinindependent manner.2 In the current study, when we examined the ability of the R123G mutant FPR to colocalize with arrestin in U937 cells, we found that no such interaction occurred, demonstrating that in a native myeloid cell line, FPR internalization occurs in the absence of arrestin binding It is interesting to note that the R123G mutant is recognized by the kinase, as we have demonstrated previously, resulting in substantial ligand-dependent phosphorylation This suggests that the R123G mutant may be able to form an overall active-like conformation state that can be recognized by the kinase but not by G protein or arrestin 3B, in which the ligand dissociation rate from the R123G mutant differs from that of the D71A mutant If the D71A mutant is incapable of forming an active conformation and wild type can form a fully active conformation, the R123G mutant may represent a new intermediate state of the receptor A D71A mutant FPR, which does not undergo activation or phosphorylation in response to ligand, did not colocalize with arrestin-2 Activation of the FPR is required for this association as demonstrated by the lack of arrestin colocalization with an inactive D71A mutant form of the FPR To characterize this interaction further, we employed two mutant forms of the FPR, R123G and D71A, that we have described previously (26) The R123G mutation is at the cytoplasmic boundary of the third transmembrane domain, and the D71A is located in the second transmembrane segment In our previous work we have demonstrated that neither the R123G nor the D71A mutant receptor was able to mediate a ligand-induced calcium response as seen with the wild type FPR To demonstrate the functional capabilities of the R123G and D71A mutants, we used membrane preparations to investigate receptor activity with respect to G protein coupling Interestingly, although both mutant receptors exhibit single rate dissociation kinetics, the R123G rate is slower than the D71A, suggesting that the Arg-123 receptor may be able to FIG To determine the extent to which the receptors internalize under the conditions used in microscopy experiments, cells expressing either wild type, R123G, or D71A FPR were treated with fluorescent agonist for 8 min and washed extensively to remove fluorescent ligand from the exterior of the cell Under the same conditions, there is essentially no internalization of the D71A receptor Fluorescence microscopy experiments were performed to determine whether either the R123G or D71A mutant receptor was able to colocalize with arrestin-2 The D71A receptor, however, remains diffuse over the cell surface reacting very differently to agonist treatment To support these findings, arrestin-2 translocation experiments were performed using the R123G and D71A cells lines These results indicate that receptor activation is required for receptor processing and arrestin binding as demonstrated by the D71A FPR mutant but that receptor phosphorylation alone, in the presence of ligand, is insufficient for arrestin binding as demonstrated by the R123G FPR mutant, which undergoes phosphorylation and internalization but does not activate G proteins The D71A mutant FPR appears totally inactive, exhibiting none of FIG U937 cells stably transfected to express either wild type (WT) FPR, or the mutant receptor R123G or D71A, were incubated for 8 min at 37 C with N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys fluorescein TABLE I Summary of properties of the wild type and mutant forms of the FPR The ligand binding, G protein interaction, internalization, and arrestin-2 binding properties are summarized for the wild type, D71A, and R123G mutant forms of the FPR expressed in U937 cells FPR Ligand affinity G protein binding Internalization Arrestin colocalization Wild type high/low D71A low R123G low FIG G protein coupling and internalization of the D71A and R123G mutants of the FPR Membrane preparations from wild type (WT), R123G, and D71A FPR-expressing cells were used in a fluorometric assay as described under "Experimental Procedures."

Although we had at first believed this mutant was inactive like the D71A mutant, we were surprised to discover that it became phosphorylated and internalized almost as well as the wild type receptor 3B, in which the ligand dissociation rate from the R123G mutant differs from that of the D71A mutant If the D71A mutant is incapable of forming an active conformation and wild type can form a fully active conformation, the R123G mutant may represent a new intermediate state of the receptor

10097088	Finally, we constructed a loss-offunction CCR2bY139F mutant that acted as a dominant negative, blocking signaling through the CCR2 wild-type receptor Third, we demonstrate that the previously described CCR2bY139F mutant form of CCR2b (15), which dimerizes after MCP-1 stimulation but does not trigger any signaling pathway, acts as a CCR2b dominant negative mutant, blocking chemokine responses through its ability to form nonproductive complexes with partners containing the functional tyrosine domain CCR2bY139F was constructed as described (15) YSK-tagged CCR2bY139F was obtained by using the above strategy For internalization studies, CCR2b- or CCR2bY139F-transfected HEK-293 cells were untreated or preincubated with 20 nM MCP-1 (10 106 cells ml, 20 min, 37C), and receptor levels were analyzed We previously showed that MCP-1 induces Ca2 mobilization in HEK-293 cells expressing the CCR2b wild-type receptor, but not when they express the CCR2bY139F mutant or are mock-transfected This result is because of the inability of the CCR2bY139F mutant to be phosphorylated on tyrosine, rendering it unable to recruit and trigger JAK2 phosphorylation, impeding Gi association to this mutant receptor and, thus, activation of the signaling pathway (15) Furthermore, using transfected HEK-293 cells, we tested the MCP-1-induced internalization of both CCR2b and CCR2bY139F Whereas CCR2b disappears from the cell surface after MCP-1 treatment (60% loss after 20 min), CCR2bY139F levels were unchanged, as demonstrated by flow cytometry analysis using anti-CCR2 antibodies (not shown) Wild-type and CCR2bY139F mutant receptor expression were identical in transfected HEK-293 cells, as measured by flow cytometry with specific antibodies (not shown) Coexpression of the wild-type CCR2b and the CCR2bY139F mutant in HEK-293 cells at a 1:2 ratio shows that the response to MCP-1 is impaired (Fig As a control, we show that coexpression of CCR5 and CCR2bY139F do not affect the response to RANTES (Fig Furthermore, MCP-1-triggered migration of CCR2b receptor-transfected HEK-293 cells is blocked when they are cotransfected with CCR2bY139F (Fig We also have observed that the CCR2bY139F mutant undergoes receptor dimerization in response to MCP-1, although it is unable to trigger downstream signals (Fig The possibility that our observations were the result of this process is discarded, as the CCR2bY139F mutant dimerizes in response to MCP-1 but does not internalize We therefore conclude that the CCR2bY139F acts as a CCR2b dominant negative mutant, which blocks chemokine responses by its ability to form nonproductive complexes with partners containing the functional domain, and demonstrates the biological significance of dimerization in chemokine responses CCR2bY139F loss-of-function mutant acts as a dominant negative mutant (A) HEK-293 cells were transfected with CCR2b and CCR2bY139F alone, cotransfected with CCR2b and CCR2bY139F, or cotransfected with CCR5 and CCR2bY139F, as indicated (C) HEK-293 cells transfected with YSK-tagged CCR2bY139F alone or cotransfected with Myc-CCR2b were stimulated with 10 nM MCP-1 for 1 min at 37C, crosslinked, and analyzed as in Fig 
9271350	This hypothesis was supported by the finding that a point mutation that converted Asp128 to Asn128 (D128N) diminished the ability of -selective agonists to inhibit cAMP accumulation while increasing the potency of morphine to reduce cAMP accumulation This differential agonist regulation of receptor function may reflect the distinct requirements of these agonists for receptor activation, a notion supported by functional studies on the D128N receptor mutant The mouse -opioid receptor and the D128N mutant cDNA were stably transfected into HEK 293 cells by a modification of the calcium phosphate protocol (17) Stable transformants were selected in growth medium containing 0.25 mg/ml geneticin (Life Technologies) for the wild-type and 1.0 mg/ml for the D128N mutant, and maintained in T 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks in 10% CO2 at 37 Receptor binding studies were performed using membranes from stably transfected HEK 293 cells expressing the -FLAG or D128N mutant cDNA Results To investigate the agonist regulation of the cloned -opioid receptor, the wild-type cDNA and a mutant form of the receptor that contained an aspartate-to-asparagine substitution at amino acid 128 (D128N) were stably expressed in HEK 293 cells To assess the effects of agonist TABLE 1 Relative potencies of opioid agonists in inhibiting forskolin-stimulated intracellular cAMP production for the cloned mouse -opioid receptor ( -WT) and the D128N mutant and agonist (1 M) pretreatment (3 hr) effects on opioid inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels for the -WT stably expressed in HEK 293 cells The ability of various opioid agonists to inhibit the forskolin-stimulated intracellular cAMP accumulation and the effects of agonist pretreatment on cAMP accumulation were determined Ligand -Opioid receptor/mutant -WT -WT agonist-pretreated cells D128N mutant EC50 Maximum inhibition EC50 Maximum inhibition EC50 Maximum inhibition nM % nM % nM % DSLET 0.02 0.01 81.5 2.2 0.4 0.1a 64.0 2.1b 12.4 7.4a 74.3 1.5 DPDPE 0.09 0.01 88.3 1.0 2.0 1.2a 73.5 4.1b 171 D128N mutant The mutant receptor, with asparagine at residue 128 (D128N), was stably expressed in HEK 293 cells Saturation binding analysis with the opioid antagonist [3H]naltrindole revealed that the Bmax and KD values for binding to the D128N mutant were 236.4 30.3 fmol/mg of protein (three experiments) and 1.45 0.17 nM, respectively (21) showing that the D128N mutant had lower affinity for -selective agonists, DADLE, DPDPE, SIOM, and DSLET were less potent in inhibiting cAMP accumulation in D128N mutant receptor-expressing HEK 293 cells than in cells expressing the wild-type receptor (Table 1, Fig Except for DPDPE, all of the selective agonists had similar maximal inhibitory effects on cAMP accumulation via the D128N and wild-type receptors but exhibited decreased potency, suggesting that Asp128 is critical for the affinity of the receptor for these agonists In contrast, the nonselective opioids etorphine, levorphanol, and EKC had similar potencies and efficacy to inhibit cAMP accumulation in HEK 293 cells expressing the wildtype and D128N mutant receptors (Table 1) This suggests the lower expression of the D128N mutant is not the cause of the reduced potency of the -selective ligands at the receptor and Asp128 is not critical for these nonselective agonists to activate the receptor In contrast to the -selective peptides, the clinically used opiates morphine and methadone were more potent and effective in inhibiting cAMP accumulation in cells with the D128N mutant than the wild-type receptor (Table 1, Fig The enhanced functional responses were mirrored by a higher receptor binding affinity of the D128N mutant for the Fig Mouse -Opioid Receptor Expressed in HEK 293 Cells 277 agonists than the wild-type receptor [Ki (nM), wild-type versus D128N mutant, morphine 1000 versus 2.3;

9670957	In contrast, when a CCR2B Tyr139Phe mutant is expressed in HEK293 cells, it is not phosphorylated in tyrosine and triggers neither JAK2/STAT3 activation nor Ca2 mobilization in response to MCP-1 In contrast, when a CCR2B Tyr139Phe mutant is expressed in HEK293 cells, it is not phosphorylated in tyrosine and triggers neither JAK2/STAT3 activation nor Ca2 mobilization in response to MCP-1 809 The Journal of Immunology The Tyr139 residue of CCR2 is critical in MCP-1-activated signaling To further investigate the significance of MCP-1-induced CCR2 receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, the CCR2B receptor Tyr139Phe mutant CCR2BY139F was constructed, expressed in HEK293 cells, and its response to MCP-1 analyzed The importance of the tyrosine in G protein activation is demonstrated here, as the Tyr139Phe mutation also impaired Ca2 mobilization triggered by MCP-1 binding and Gi association to the CCR2B receptor

Classical measurement of agonist-independent IP production was not suitable for screening and was poorly sensitive, as demonstrated with the N111A mutant, with only 50200% increase over control (data not shown; ref For the AT1A receptor mutant N111A, changes in affinity and efficacy have been experimentally demonstrated with CGP42112A, a classical AT2 ligand (19, 22, 23) A test based on the properties of CGP42112A fully satisfied the required specifications: (i) by using orin, a luminescent protein sensitive to intracellular calcium mobilization, it was easy to perform on thousands of clones; and (ii) in this assay, the EC50 for CGP42112A was 500 nM for the WT and 10 nM for the N111A mutant, resulting in luminescence levels 100-fold higher for the N111A mutant than for the WT, after stimulation with 200 nM CGP42112A Finally, Losartan was tested for its inverse agonist activity: i.e., its ability to stabilize the inactive conformation of the receptor and consequently decrease the basal IP levels of a CAM receptor, as previously demonstrated for the N111A mutant (19) For the AT1A receptor mutant N111A, changes in apparent affinity and efficacy have been demonstrated for the pseudopeptidic AT2 ligand CGP42112A (19, 22, 23) By using this strategy, the phenotype of 16 of the 17 clones was attributed to one of the following 13 amino acid substitutions:

these ligands in W351A mutant The WT, the truncated, and the F227A, F347A, and W351A mutated rat CCKB receptors were transiently expressed in Cos-7 cells, and radioligand binding experiments and IP assays were performed Except for cells expressing the W351A mutated receptor, the binding of [3H]pCCK8 to transfected cells was specific and saturable In the case of the W351A mutant receptor, the binding experiments performed with [3H]pCCK8 were difficult to interpret due to high nonspecific binding With this radioligand, specific and saturable binding was observed for both WT and W351A

potency toward the R327M mutant receptor could be due to the disruption of an ionic interaction between Arg327 and the Cterminal acidic function of NT, we determined the potencies of NT, NT-(8 13), and NT-(8 13)-NH2 for their ability to stimulate IP production in the wild type rNTR1 and the R327M mutant The potency of both NT and NT-(8 13) was decreased by 4 orders of magnitude in cells transfected with the R327M mutant as compared with the wild type receptor Actually, the amidated analog was 10 times more potent than its parent peptide NT-(8 13) in stimulating IP production in R327M

proposed that Asp139 might form ionic interactions with the guanidinium group of Arg8 or Arg9 in the NT sequence (30) Here, we mutated Asp139 to alanine, expressed the mutant receptor in COS M6 cells, and found that the D139A receptor was devoid of measurable 125I-NT and [3H]SR 48692 binding NT-stimulated IP production was then measured in D139A receptor-expressing cells Here, we show that the D139A mutant receptor is devoid of measurable NT and SR 48692 binding Rather, we think it more likely that the D139A mutation produces a major change in receptor conformation that affects both agonist

8626427	Although both serine mutations in the 2a-AR did produce a decrease in affinity with epinephrine and phenylephrine, only synephrine produced an attenuation of function with Ser204 3 Ala, the equivalent serine to Ser207 in the 2-AR In addition, when combined with a recently described constitutively active 1a-AR mutation (Met292 3 Leu), only the Ser188 3 Ala mutation and not Ser192 3 Ala relieved the high affinity binding and increased agonist potency observed with the Met292 3 Leu mutation We recently described a chimeric point mutation in the 1aAR, Met292 3 Leu, that was created to explore the agonist binding pocket differences between 1a- and 1b-ARs Since this 1a mutation, Met292 3 Leu, appeared to be operating through a conformational change of TMV, we explored the possibility that the serine residues on TMV might also be involved in manifesting its constitutive activity Therefore, we combined the constitutively active mutation, Met292 3 Leu, with either serine mutation, Ser192 3 Ala or Ser188 3 Ala, in a single receptor and evaluated the resulting double mutant for changes in potency, basal IP3 release, and agonist binding affinity The Met292 3 Leu mutation alone was constitutively active, as evidenced by its higher IP3 basal activity (Fig However, basal IP3 signal transduction remained higher when combined with either serine mutation (Met292 3 Leu/Ser192 3 Ala or Met292 3 Leu/Ser188 3 Ala), indicating an agonist-independent property of this mutant However, the high binding affinity for epinephrine as seen in Met292 3 Leu alone was abolished by combination with either serine mutation This is in contrast to the single serine mutations and most likely is due to both serines in the Met292 3 Leu mutant being moved closer to the agonist binding pocket Likewise, in dose-response studies with epinephrine, the Met292 3 Leu/Ser188 3 Ala combination virtually abolished the signal transduction and lowered the EC50 back to wild type values, essentially reversing the agonist-dependent manifestations of constitutive activity Binding of epinephrine or its monohydroxyl congeners, phenylephrine and synephrine, was not decreased when tested with alaninesubstitution

1a-ARs 1), we previously demonstrated that a Ser208 3 Ala mutation in the 1b-AR had no effect on agonist binding affinity and functional responsiveness (3) Binding of epinephrine or its monohydroxyl congeners, phenylephrine and synephrine, was not decreased when tested with alaninesubstitution mutants that lacked either Ser188 (Ser188 3 Ala) or Ser192 (Ser192 3 Ala) However, receptor-mediated inositol phosphate production was markedly attenuated only with the Ser188 3 Ala mutation and not with Ser192 3 Ala In support of the importance of Ser188, binding of phenylephrine (meta-hydroxyl only) by Ser192 3 Ala increased 7-fold over that observed with either the wild type receptor or the Ser188 3 Ala mutation Binding of synephrine (para-hydroxyl only) was unchanged with the Ser192 3 Ala mutation In addition, when combined with a recently described constitutively active 1a-AR mutation (Met292 3 Leu), only the Ser188 3 Ala mutation and not Ser192 3 Ala relieved the high affinity binding and increased agonist potency observed with the Met292 3 Leu mutation These receptors are denoted as Ser188 3 Ala, Ser192 3 Ala, and Ser188/192 3 Ala and correspond to the substitution of

For LSD and 5-HT, the change in binding energy ( G) introduced by the mutation T196A could be calculated both from the EC50 values determined in adenylyl cyclase stimulation assays and the Kd and Ki values determined in [3H]LSD binding experiments (Table 2) Stimulation of cAMP accumulation in HEK 293 cells expressing wildtype 5-HT6 receptor (f), mutant A154S (F), or mutant T196A (OE) by 5-HT (a) and LSD (b) The decreased potency of both 5-HT and LSD observed in the cAMP accumulation experiments with mutant T196A presumably is a direct consequence of the reduction in binding affinity that is detected in the [3H] LSD binding assays The increased affinity of mesulergine and methysergide could be the result of the elimination of an unfavorable steric interaction between the methyl group in the N1 position of these ligands and the hydroxyl and methyl group of Thr196 in the wild-type receptor that are removed in the T196A mutant (Fig Among 5-HT receptors, the interaction between agonists

Ballesteros and Weinstein, 1995; Baldwin et al., 1997) To elucidate the importance of the conserved aspartic acid (Asp-130) in the Asp-Arg-Tyr motif of the 2 adrenergic receptor ( 2AR), we mutated this residue to asparagine (D130N) to mimic its protonated state, and to alanine (D130A) to fully remove the functionality of the side chain In COS-7 cells expressing either D130N or D130A, basal levels of cAMP accumulation were clearly elevated compared with cells expressing the wild-type 2AR To test this hypothesis the aspartic acid in the DRY motif of the human 2AR (Asp-130; Asp3.49 according to the general nomenclature proposed in Ballesteros and Weinstein, 1995) was mutated to asparagine (D130N) to mimic the protonated state of the side chain and alanine (D130A) to completely remove its functionality The mutations of Asp-130 to D130N and D130A in the 2AR were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-mediated mutagenesis using the Pfu polymerase according the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) To assess the ability of ligands to affect receptor stability, membranes expressing the WT or the D130A mutant were incubated for 6 h at 37C in binding buffer containing protease inhibitors plus 10 M ( )-ISO with 10 mM ascorbate or 1 M ICI 118,551 For nickelpurification of the WT and the D130A mutant, Sf-9 cells were grown in 500-ml cultures at a density of 3 106 cells/ml, infected with a 1:30 dilution of a high titer virus stock and harvested after 48 h 1) was mutated to asparagine Mutation of a Conserved Aspartic Acid in the 2 Adrenergic Receptor 177 and alanine (D130N and D130A) D130N displayed the highest activity (slope 0.31 103 cpm pmol 1 mg protein 1) followed by D130A (slope 0.174 103 cpm pmol 1 mg protein 1) and WT (slope 0.013 103 cpm pmol 1 mg protein 1;

Ballesteros and Weinstein, 1995; Baldwin et al., 1997) The mutation of Cys-285 (C285S) was generated as described (Javitch et al., 1997) For transient expression in HEK-293 cells, the wild-type (WT) receptor, D130N, and D130N/C285S were cloned into pCIN4 (Javitch et al., 1997) The HEK 293 cells, grown in 35-mm dishes and transiently expressing the D130N or the D130N/C285S mutants, were washed in PBS, briefly treated with PBS containing 5 mM EDTA, and then dissociated in PBS (Javitch et al., 1997) we found that MTSEA inhibited binding of [3H]CGP-12177 up to around 40% in the D130N mutant, whereas concomitant mutation of Cys-285 (D130N/C285S) eliminated this inhibition (Fig In competition binding experiments with [3H]CGP-12177 on membranes from HEK 293 cells, a Ki value for ISO of 1.52 0.37 nM (mean S.E., n 3) was observed for D130N and 1.52 0.35 nM for D130N/C285S (mean S.E., n 3) Furthermore, both D130N and D130N/ C285S displayed the same affinity for [3H]CGP-12177 (Kd [D130N] 55 2 pM, Kd [D130N/C285S] 78 18 pM, means S.E., n 3) Effects of MTSEA treatment on specific [3H]CGP-12177 binding to D130N and D130N/C285S A, HEK 293 cells transiently expressing D130N (F) or D130N/C285S (E) were treated with indicated concentrations of MTSEA before determination of specific [3H]CGP-12177 binding To elucidate the importance of the conserved aspartic acid (Asp-130) in the Asp-Arg-Tyr motif of the 2 adrenergic receptor ( 2AR), we mutated this residue to asparagine (D130N) to mimic its protonated state, and to alanine (D130A) to fully remove the functionality of the side chain In COS-7 cells expressing either D130N or D130A, basal levels of cAMP accumulation were clearly elevated compared with cells expressing the wild-type 2AR In D130N, a cysteine in TM 6, Cys-285, which is not accessible in the wild-type 2AR, became accessible to methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium, a charged, sulfhydryl-reactive reagent To test this hypothesis the aspartic acid in the DRY motif of the human 2AR (Asp-130; Asp3.49 according to the general nomenclature proposed in Ballesteros and Weinstein, 1995) was mutated to asparagine (D130N) to mimic the protonated state of the side chain and alanine (D130A) to completely remove its functionality The mutations of Asp-130 to D130N and D130A in the 2AR were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-mediated mutagenesis using the Pfu polymerase according the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) For transient expression in HEK-293 cells, the wild-type (WT) receptor, D130N, and D130N/C285S were cloned into pCIN4 (Javitch et al., 1997) The cysteine (Cys-2856.47) that becomes partially accessible in the D130N mutant and in CAM (Javitch et al., 1997) is located in TM 6 and is indicated with a white letter in a dark shaded circle The HEK 293 cells, grown in 35-mm dishes and transiently expressing the D130N or the D130N/C285S mutants, were washed in PBS, briefly treated with PBS containing 5 mM EDTA, and then dissociated in PBS 1) was mutated to asparagine Mutation of a Conserved Aspartic Acid in the 2 Adrenergic Receptor 177 and alanine (D130N and D130A) D130N displayed the highest activity (slope 0.31 103 cpm pmol 1 mg protein 1) followed by D130A (slope 0.174 103 cpm pmol 1 mg protein 1) and WT (slope 0.013 103 cpm pmol 1 mg protein 1;

in the N295D construct (Fig Furthermore, certain mutations (e.g., V108A, H256A, and N295D of the current study) may affect the efficacy and not the affinity of ligands Importantly, the dramatic effect on receptor activation of the dualistic compounds caused by receptor substitutions such as V108A and N295D, which had minimal effect on their binding affinity and affected neither angiotensin binding

binding overlapped both mutations that reduced angiotensin binding (T287A) and mutations that impaired the binding of the pure antagonist L158,809 (N294A) at the top and middle of TM VII, respectively (Table 1) Thus, in the N295D rat AT1 construct, L-162,782, L-162,313, and L-162,389 all antagonized the angiotensin-induced phosphatidylinositol turnover with surprisingly similar IC50 values (90 180 nM), and they all bound with unaltered, high affinity (2236 nM) COS-7 cells (0.150.4 106) expressing the rat AT1 receptor or the V108A, H256A, or N295D mutant versions of this were cultivated for 24 hr in inositol-free medium (1885 Dulbecco with NaH2CO3, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, and 0.1 mg/ml gentamicin) in 6- or 12-well plates, with each well containing 5 Ci of myo-[3H]inositol (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL), as described previously (25) As previously reported (3, 14), a number of substitutions in TMs III (N111A) and VII (N294A, N295D, N298A) impaired the binding of the pure antagonist L-158,809 by 618-fold (Table 1) Dualist Nonpeptide Ligands for the AT1 Receptor 305 TABLE 1 Comparison of binding affinities for antagonists in wild-type and mutated AT

as determined in binding assays, the EC50 for the peptide was similar in the wild-type AT1 receptor (0.6 nM) and the mutants with either the V108A substitution in TM III (1.0 nM) or the N295D

legend to Fig The effect was most pronounced for L-162,313, which was unable to stimulate phosphatidylinositol turnover in the V108A mutant and showed only a much reduced response in the N295D construct (Fig The effects of the nonpeptide compounds were studied in greater detail in the N295D rat AT1 construct (Fig Interestingly, no clear bell-shaped dose-response curves were observed in the N295D rat AT1 construct for the nonpeptide compounds that here functioned as merely relatively poor, classic partial agonists (Fig In regard to antagonistic property, all three nonpeptide compounds surprisingly acted as equally potent inhibitors of the angiotensin-induced increase in phosphatidylinositol turnover in the N295D construct, with IC50 values of 90180 nM (Fig Thus, in the N295D construct, there was a relatively close relationship between the affinity of the compounds as determined in competition binding assays (IC50 2137 nM; Table 1) and the IC50 values obtained for these compounds as antagonists for a submaximal stimulatory dose of angiotensin (Fig In the N295D construct, the L-162,389 behaved as an insurmountable antagonist as it did in the wild-type AT1 receptor (data not shown), which unfortunately complicates a more thorough analysis of antagonist potency Phosphatidylinositol (IP) turnover in response to nonpeptide compounds administered alone or with angiotensin II in transiently transfected COS-7 cells expressing the N295D rat AT1 receptor The observations in the N295D rat AT1 receptor may provide some insight into the mechanism of action of the nonpeptide compounds on the wild-type AT1 receptor Surprisingly, we have not yet identified any receptor mutation that seriously affects the binding affinity of the prototype nonpeptide agonist L-162,313 (3) (Table 1), although some substitutions, such as N295D, certainly impair the ability of the compound to activate the receptor Furthermore, certain mutations (e.g., V108A, H256A, and N295D of the current study) may affect the efficacy and not the affinity of ligands Importantly, the dramatic effect on receptor activation of the dualistic compounds caused by receptor substitutions such as V108A and N295D, which had minimal effect on their binding affinity and affected neither angiotensin binding nor coupling, emphasizes that functional data are very important in mutational analysis of ligand/receptor interactions A series of point mutations in the transmembrane segments (TMs) of the AT1 receptor had only minor effect on the binding affinity of the nonpeptide compounds, with the exception of A104V at the top of TM III, which selectively impaired the binding of L-162,782 and L-162,389 The 8-fold reduction in the affinity of L-158,809 in response to the A104V substitution in TM III has not previously been reported (Table 1) Dualist Nonpeptide Ligands for the AT1 Receptor 305 TABLE 1 Comparison of binding affinities for antagonists in wild-type and mutated AT 1 receptors [Sar

(wild-type AT 1 receptor) The binding of L-162,389 was most seriously affected (26-fold) by the A104V substitution at the top of TM III, which also impaired L-158,809 binding by 8-fold The binding of L-162,782, the nonpeptide compound that was the most efficient agonist on the wild-type receptor, was also affected seriously by the A104V mutation (20-fold) but not by any of the other mutations (0.62.1-fold reduction in affinity) (Table 1) Thus, except for the A104V substitution, none of the tested mutations in the TM of the AT1 receptor had any major effect on the affinity of the nonpeptide partial agonist compounds as determined in competition binding assays, albeit slight effects were observed for the most antagonistic one, L-162,389 Nevertheless, one mutation, A104V, at the top of TM III impaired the binding of both compounds regardless of their biological properties Importantly, the high affinity binding of both agonist and antagonist nonpeptide compounds of the new biphenylimidazole series was affected by the A104V substitution in TM III As previously reported (3, 14), a number of substitutions in TMs III (N111A) and VII (N294A, N295D, N298A) impaired the

N597R) or gain of function (N593R and N597Q), this being the first evidence of a position in LHR that, depending upon the nature of the amino acid residue, can result in constitutive activation and/or diminished responsiveness to ligand 2 for competitive binding and ligand-mediated signaling of the N593A, C595A, and N597A LHR mutants 1) For the N593A and C595A mutants, receptor expression was comparable to or exceeded that of WT LHR, but responsiveness to hCG was diminished;

increases in [35S]GTP S binding (1025% above basal values determined in the absence of carbachol) (Fig Treatment of membranes with the oxidizing agent, Cu(II)-phenanthroline, had little or no effect

10496961	A mutant human M [HM5(S465Y, T466P)] receptor showed significant constitutive activity, increased agonist potency, and binding affinity (Spalding et al., 1995) In contrast to the high level of constitutive activity observed for HM5(S465Y, T466P) receptors, HM1(S388Y, T389P) receptors showed limited constitutive activity ( 20%) at high expression levels, but not at low expression levels ( X.-P However, the common features, enhanced agonist potency and binding affinity, observed at HM5(S465Y, T466P) and HM1(S388Y, T389P) receptors suggest that the junction of transmembrane domain (TM) VI and the N-terminal of the third extracellular loop (Ne3) has a conserved functional role in mAChRs Differential Modulation of Agonist Potency and Receptor Coupling by Mutations of Ser388Tyr and Thr389Pro at the Junction of Transmembrane Domain VI and the Third Extracellular Loop of Human M1 Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptors XI-PING HUANG, FREDERICK E To determine the functional role of individual mutations of Ser388Tyr and Thr389Pro, we created stable A9 L cell lines expressing HM1(S388Y) or HM1(T389P) receptors In ligand binding experiments, mutation of Ser388Tyr resulted in significantly increased agonist binding affinity These results demonstrate that the Ser388Tyr mutation is responsible for enhanced agonist potency and binding affinity, whereas the Thr389Pro mutation alters G protein interactions Here we present results indicating that the Ser388Tyr mutation is responsible for enhanced agonist potency and agonist binding affinity, whereas the Thr389Pro mutation is responsible for altering G protein interactions The sense primer for the Ser388Tyr mutation was 5 -GGTGCTGGTGTACACCTTCTGCAAGG-3 (with the changed base in bold), and the antisense primer was 5 -CCTTGCAGAAGGTGTACACCAGCACC-3 These data indicate that the mutation of Ser388Tyr resulted in enhanced agonist potency, an intrinsic property observed at HM1(S388Y, T389P) receptors (Huang et al., 1998) In the present study, the Ser388Tyr mutation did not result in a high level of constitutive activity in PI hydrolysis assays but rather produced significant increases in agonist potency and binding affinity In addition, mutations at Pro271 (equivalent to Ser388) in NK1 receptors increased substance P binding affinity and decreased the Hill slope (Gether et al., 1994), suggesting that mutations in this region improve G protein coupling, in a similar fashion to the Ser388Tyr mutation in HM1 receptors Taken together, the data indicate that the Ser388Tyr mutation is the major source of enhanced agonist potency and binding affinity, whereas the Thr389Pro mutation more subtly modified receptor interactions with G proteins The PI hydrolysis in A9 L cells expressing HM1(S388Y) receptors (160 33%, n 6) was comparable with untransfected A9 L cells or transfected A9 L cells expressing HM1(WT) receptors or HM1(N382A) mutant receptors (Huang et al., submitted for publication) Differential Modulation of Agonist Potency and Receptor Coupling by Mutations of Ser388Tyr and Thr389Pro at the Junction of Transmembrane Domain VI and the Third Extracellular Loop of Human M1 Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptors XI-PING HUANG, FREDERICK E To determine the functional role of individual mutations of Ser388Tyr and Thr389Pro, we created stable A9 L cell lines expressing HM1(S388Y) or HM1(T389P) receptors In contrast, mutation of Thr389Pro did not change agonist binding affinity but rendered multiple agonist binding sites, and the high-affinity binding was sensitive to GTP analogs These results demonstrate that the Ser388Tyr mutation is responsible for enhanced agonist potency and binding affinity, whereas the Thr389Pro mutation alters G protein interactions Here we present results indicating that the Ser388Tyr mutation is responsible for enhanced agonist potency and agonist binding affinity, whereas the Thr389Pro mutation is responsible for altering G protein

together, the data indicate that the Ser388Tyr mutation is the major source of enhanced agonist potency and binding affinity, whereas the Thr389Pro mutation more subtly modified receptor interactions with G proteins Mutations of Ser388 and Thr389 to Tyr and Pro, respectively, in HM1 receptors may induce the mutant receptor to form structurally and conformationally flexible states that are favorable for agonist binding and activation (Huang et al., 1998), as suggested recently in mutant 2-adrenergic receptors (Kobilka et al., 1998) The naturally occurring mutation of Ala593Pro in the human luteinizing hormone receptor (Ala593 corresponding to Thr389) does not change hormone binding affinity but abolishes Gs coupling (Kremer et al., 1995) A mutant human M [HM5(S465Y, T466P)] receptor showed significant constitutive activity, increased agonist potency, and binding affinity (Spalding et al., 1995) In contrast to the high level of constitutive activity observed for HM5(S465Y, T466P) receptors, HM1(S388Y, T389P) receptors showed limited constitutive activity ( 20%) at high expression levels, but not at low expression levels ( X.-P However, the common features,

extracellular loop (Ne3) has a conserved functional role in mAChRs In addition, Ser388Thr389 may harbor allosteric binding sites that regulate the binding of ligands at the primary site, although HM1(T389A) receptors did not exhibit changes in binding affinities for NMS, ACh, or an allosteric ligand, gallamine (Matsui et al., 1995) 
10574914	The affinity of selective 1b-adrenergic receptor antagonists for the switch mutant (D125K/K331D) was no different from the wild-type 1b-adrenergic receptor, suggesting that both receptors are maintaining similar tertiary structures in the cell membrane Finally, the switch mutant (D125K/K331D) displayed similar basal signaling activity as the wild-type receptor, reversing the constitutive activity of the single point mutations (D125K and K331D) This switch mutation (D125K/K331D) reversed the constitutive activity of the single receptor mutations (D125K or K331D) but, interestingly, was also equally activated as the WT receptor by either positively or negatively charged agonists This mutant 1b-D125K/K331D-AR switches the amino acids that constitute the previously described receptor salt-bridge constraint (3) Wild-type D125K/K331D Antagonists 125I-HEAT 83 10 pM 110 31 pM Prazosin 243 30 pM 299 99 pM Phentolamine 36 10 nM 29 20 nM Agonists Epinephrine 1.4 0.3 M 6.2 0.7 M * Phenylephrine 12.9 0.6 M 77.6 1.5 M * Oxymetazoline 0.9 0.2 M 5.0 1.0 M * 3-(2-Hydroxyphenyl)proprionic acid 2.9 0.9 mM 0.5 0.4 mM* 3-Methoxyphenyl acetic acid 5.7 1.4 mM 1.9 0.4 mM* 1b Adrenergic Receptor Activation Mechanism 34536 significantly 10-fold lower (2.0 0.8 versus 0.2 0.1 M , p 0.05) than the WT receptor Potency of phenylephrine to produce soluble IPs by activating the WT or switch 1b D125K/K331D AR mutant COS-1 cells expressing the WT 1b-AR (f) or the mutant D125K/K331D receptor ( ) were stimulated with increasing concentrations of phenylephrine to generate soluble inositol phosphates A half-maximal response for the switch mutant D125K/K331D receptor (2.0 0.8 M) was achieved at a significantly lower phenylephrine concentration (p 0.05) when compared with the WT 1b-AR (0.2 0.1 M) Receptor expression levels were 54 10 fmol/mg of membrane protein for the WT 1b-AR and 22 4 fmol/mg of membrane protein for the D125K/K331D receptor mutation The amount of basal IP3 generated from COS-1 cells (106 cells) transiently expressing either the WT, D125K, K331D, or D125K/K331D 1b-ARs was quantified and normalized to receptor number determined from parallel saturation binding experiments The density of expression was 59 7 fmol/mg membrane protein for the WT, 17 6 fmol/mg for D125K, 45 7 fmol/mg for K331D, and 21 4 fmol/mg for the D125K/K331D 1b-ARs In further experiments, these amino acids were switched in a double mutation (E113K/ K296E) of the rhodopsin receptor to substantiate this ionic constraint hypothesis Regeneration of the ionic pair in the switch mutant reversed the constitutive activity of the single mutant K296E For example, an 1b-D125A-AR mutant does not have a significantly different antagonist affinity value when compared with the WT receptor (3) The degree of decreased affinity of protonated amine agonists (4 6-fold) for the switch mutant is consistent with agonist affinity losses (317-fold) for the D125A 1b-AR mutation (3) In further experiments, these amino acids were switched in a double mutation (E113K/ K296E) of the rhodopsin receptor to substantiate this ionic constraint hypothesis However, functionality of the double and E113K mutations could not be verified because they could not reconstitute with the chromophore We have previously described the constitutive properties of the 1bD125K-AR and an analogous K331E mutation (3) The affinity of selective 1b-adrenergic receptor antagonists for the switch mutant (D125K/K331D) was no different from the wild-type 1b-adrenergic receptor, suggesting that both receptors are maintaining similar tertiary structures in the cell membrane Finally, the switch mutant (D125K/K331D) displayed similar basal signaling activity as the wild-type receptor, reversing the constitutive activity of the single point mutations (D125K and K331D) This switch mutation (D125K/K331D) reversed the constitutive activity of the single receptor mutations (D125K or K331D) but, interestingly, was also equally activated as the WT receptor by either positively or negatively charged agonists This mutant 1b-D125K/K331D-AR switches the amino acids that constitute the previously described receptor salt-bridge constraint (3) Wild-type D125K/K331D Antagonists 125I-HEAT 83 10 pM 110 31 pM Prazosin 243 30 pM 299 99 pM Phentolamine 36 10 nM 29 20 nM Agonists Epinephrine 1.4 0.3 M 6.2 0.7 M * Phenylephrine 12.9 0.6 M 77.6 1.5 M * Oxymetazoline 0.9 0.2 M 5.0 1.0 M * 3-(2-Hydroxyphenyl)proprionic acid 2.9 0.9 mM 0.5 0.4 mM* 3-Methoxyphenyl acetic acid 5.7 1.4 mM 1.9 0.4 mM* 1b Adrenergic Receptor Activation Mechanism 34536 significantly 10-fold lower (2.0 0.8 versus 0.2 0.1 M , p 0.05) than the WT receptor We also investigated the basal signaling properties for the switch mutation, the WT 1b-AR and the individual mutations (D125K or K331D) that make up the double mutant A similar 3-fold increase in basal IP3 production over the WT receptor was calculated for the newly characterized 1b-K331D-AR (55.2 3.6 pmol/fmol;

8999904	Similar results were obtained for M11.12, a mutant cAR1 in which Ser183 and Ser195 present in the third intracellular loop have been replaced with Gly residues by site-directed mutagenesis. Similar results were obtained for M11.12, a mutant cAR1 in which Ser183 and Ser195 present in the third intracellular loop have been replaced with Gly residues by site-directed mutagenesis. This is probably not due to replacement of the positively charged Lys207 residue or due to changes in the size of the amino acid side chain since mutant wtl-9 (Lys207 3 Ile) did not influence cAMP binding affinity This mutant has two alterations in amino acids (Ser183 3 Pro, Thr186 3 Ser) adjacent to the fifth transmembrane helix Mutant IV-7 also had a single mutation in this area as well as several other in the central and C-terminal side of the loop, including Tyr204 3 Asp Of the rest, 5 receptors were partially characterized and are not shown, 14 receptors contained the wild-type cAR1 sequence, 12 receptors had a single Lys207 3 Asn which was observed in clone Ia-9, 2 receptors had frameshift mutations, and the other 5 possessed sequences identical to certain of the mutant receptors presented in Table I This mutant has two alterations in amino acids (Ser183 3 Pro, Thr186 3 Ser) adjacent to the fifth transmembrane helix The proline substitution is likely the more important determinant of the IV-8 phenotype since mutant I-9, although not wtl, contains the same Thr186 3 Ser substitution and was able to elicit all responses and rescue development Mutant IIIa-1 had a single amino acid substitution Arg184 3 Gly close to the N-terminal side of the loop Mutant IIIa-2 altered the same amino acid residue Arg184 3 Cys, although it had several additional alterations

8631790	To uncouple the H2 receptor from the Gs-protein, we introduced the Leu124 3 Ala mutation in the second intracellular loop of the H2 receptor This H2 Leu124 3 Ala receptor mutant was partially uncoupled from its G-protein and proved to be a suitable tool for investigating the existence of possible cAMP-dependent and independent pathways in the process of agonist-induced H2 receptor down-regulation MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Culture--CHO cells expressing the rat histamine H2 receptor (CHOrH2) (13) and the mutated H2 Leu124 3 Ala receptor (CHOrH2Leu124Ala) were grown at 37 C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), containing 10% (v/v) dialyzed fetal calf serum supplemented with 2 mM Lglutamine, MEM amino acids, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 g/ml streptomycin Site-directed Mutagenesis--The H2 receptor mutant, in which leucine 124 was substituted by alanine (Leu124 3 Ala) (Fig Using 100 ng of pSVrH2 (13) as a template, 0.4 M S1, 0.4 M AS2, 40 M dNTPs, and 2.5 units of Amplitaq according to the manufacturer's protocol (Perkin Elmer), a 392-base pair DNA fragment of the H2 Leu124 3 Ala receptor mutant was amplified in 100 l using 30 cycles at 94 C for 1 min, 56 C for 1 min, and 72 C for 1.5 min and a final extension at 72 C for 10 min Subsequently, the coding sequence of the mutated H2 Leu124 3 Ala receptor was subcloned into the eukaryotic pSV expression vector Functional Analysis of the Leu124 3 Ala Mutation of the Rat Histamine H2 Receptor--Using the polymerase chain reaction, leucine 124 in the second intracellular loop of the rat histamine H2 receptor (Fig Transfection of the H2 Leu124 3 Ala receptor cDNA into CHO cells, resulted in the formation of several clonal cell lines expressing [125I]APT binding sites In contrast, the introduced Leu124 3 Ala mutation significantly affected the agonist binding characteristics Moreover, the Leu124 3 Ala mutation also affected the ability of histamine to induce the formation of cAMP in CHOrH2Leu124Ala cells (Fig Histamine-induced Down-regulation of Rat H2 Leu124 3 Ala Receptors--Long-term exposure (24 h) of CHOrH2Leu124Ala cells to increasing concentrations of histamine resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of [125I]APT binding sites (Fig Comparing the histamineinduced cAMP production and H2 Leu124 3 Ala receptor downregulation (Fig The physical uncoupling of the H2 Leu124 3 Ala mutant was paralleled by a functional uncoupling, characterized by an impairment of the histamine-induced cAMP production (160fold reduction of the EC50 value and 55% decrease of the maximal cAMP response) Effects of Leu124 3 Ala mutation on histamine-induced cAMP production and down-regulation B, effects of Leu124 3 Ala mutation on histamineinduced H2 receptor down-regulation (open circles) and cAMP production (filled circles, see also above) Remarkably, both the maximum histamine-induced and forskolin-induced down-regulation of H2 Leu124 3 Ala receptor were found to be more pronounced than for the wild-type H2 receptor, suggesting that the mutated receptor has become more susceptible to receptor down-regulation Although we do not have an explanation for this finding, we hypothesize that the Leu124 3 Ala mutation induces a conformational change in the second intracellular loop of the H2 receptor protein, causing an uncoupling from the Gs-protein but also an increase of the accessibility of molecular entities involved in receptor degradation Interestingly, the H2 Leu124 3 Ala mutant receptor was still downregulated by histamine, at concentrations which showed no increase of cAMP, thereby providing additional evidence for a cAMP-independent pathway in the process of agonist-induced H2 receptor down-regulation

(ii) in support of this model is the finding that overexpression of wild-type receptors can also initiate biochemical responses in the absence of agonist; (iii) accordingly, it has been proposed that receptors spontaneously resonate between a basal state, R, and an active state, R*, with only the latter being able to productively interact with G-protein, and (iv) as a corollary, constitutively active mutants, which partially mimic the active state, represent an intermediate receptor conformation, R (26) By contrast, and consistent with an R conformation, basal signaling was readily apparent with the unliganded A293E mutant Since the double mutants F310A/A293E and F310L/A293E also showed similar basal signaling in the absence of agonist, but impaired agonist-induced signaling, the Phe310-catechol ring interaction is likely not required for isomerization between R and R , but is critical for full receptor activation All lysine-substituted mutants showed wild-type membrane expression (Western blotting and in situ immunofluorescence), and as observed with MTSEA derivitization of F310Csubstituted receptors, the F310K mutants displayed loss of [125I]HEAT binding Saturation binding and immunoblotting studies indicated that the F303A, F303L, and Y348L mutants were expressed in the plasma membrane and processed (glycosylation) at levels almost equal to the wild-type 1B-AR (Table I and Fig All three mutants showed only small decreases (1.72.2-fold) in affinity for the antagonist radioligand, [125I]HEAT (Table I) and no change (Y348L) or an increase (520-fold, F303A and F303L) in affinity for the agonists, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and phenylephrine (Fig WT F310A F310L F311A F311L F303A F303L Y348L Amount of DNA transfected ( g/100-mm dish) 2 2 2 25 20 2 2 2 Receptor density Bmax (pmol/mg) 8.12 0.77 8.21 1.53 8.09 1.66 0.95 0.05a 1.70 0.34b 5.88 0.72 4.80 0.18b 6.18 0.51 KD (pM) 66.5 2.4 66.2 15.2 84.3 30 454 10a 60.2 17 121 32 116 36 145 26b a p 0.001 indicates significant differences versus the wild-type 1B-AR However, in contrast to the Phe310 mutants, plasma membrane expression was markedly impaired with both F311A and F311L, and could not be enhanced by increasing the amounts of plasmid transfected (Table I and Fig WT F310A F310L F311A F311L F303A F303L Y348L Amount of DNA transfected ( g/100-mm dish) 2 2 2 25 20 2 2 2 Receptor density Bmax (pmol/mg) 8.12 0.77 8.21 1.53 8.09 1.66 0.95 0.05a 1.70 0.34b 5.88 0.72 4.80 0.18b 6.18 0.51 KD (pM) 66.5 2.4 66.2 15.2 84.3 30 454 10a 60.2 17 121 32 116 36 145 26b a p 0.001 indicates significant differences versus the wild-type 1B-AR Cells were transfected with 2 g of cDNA for each construct, except that 25 and 20 g of the F311A and F311L constructs were used, respectively Antagonist WT F310A F310L F311A F311L Phentolamine 31.4 2.9 315 19a 233 37b 265 18a 276 18a (10) (7) (8) (9) Prazosin 0.77 0.06 33.8 3.2a 1.08 0.12 51.7 11.8a 72.2 6.5a (44) (1.4) (67) (94) 5-Methylurapidil 94.7 0.01 494 0.02a 762 15a 443 84a 648 61a (5) (8) (5) (7) a p 0.001 indicates significance differences versus the wild-type 1B-AR COS-1 cells expressing the wild-type ( ) or mutant (f, F310W;

chain of this residue mimics the MTSEA moiety that binds to cysteine, it should produce similar effects to MTSEA derivitization of F310C- or F311C-substituted wild-type or C128S/C129S/C137S receptors To more directly evaluate the involvement of Phe310 in catechol ring binding, it was mutated to alanine or leucine, and the resulting mutants (F310A and F310L), as well as the wildtype 1B-AR, were then evaluated in terms of membrane expression, ligand binding, and stimulation of PI hydrolysis 4A, the F310A mutant showed affinity losses of up to 1000-fold for the full agonists, but smaller losses (10 50-fold) for the partial agonists Consistent with the involvement of Phe310 in ligand binding, the F310L mutant in which the hydrophobicity but not the aromaticity of the wild-type phenylalanine residue is preserved, displayed lesser decreases in binding of both full agonists (30 40-fold) and partial agonists (310-fold), than the F310A mutant (Fig Whereas the affinity for epinephrine, phenylephrine, and halostachine was up to 1000fold lower with the F310A mutant than with the wild-type receptor, substitution of Phe310 with a tryptophan, which although slightly larger than the native phenylalanine, preserves both its hydrophobicity and aromaticity, resulted in a receptor protein with near wild-type agonist affinities WT F310A F310L F311A F311L F303A F303L Y348L

the wild-type 1B-AR), but also in efficacy of epinephrine-stimulated PI hydrolysis (Emax 60% of the wild-type response) (Fig Finally, to confirm that the effects of the F310A and F310L mutations on PI signaling are not due to a global change in receptor structure, we combined them with a previously described constitutively active mutant, A293E (25, 26), to produce the double mutants, F310A/A293E and F310L/A293E 8, signaling in the absence of agonist by the F310A or F310L mutants was not different from that observed with the wildtype 1B-AR Thus, F310A and F310L are not constitutively active Moreover, increased basal signaling by the A293E mutant, which is dependent on its level of expression, was not altered with the double mutants, F310A/A293E or F310L/ A293E (Fig COS-1 cells expressing the wild-type ( ) or mutant (f, F310W; E, F310L; q, F310A; , F311A; , F311L) 1B-ARs were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of each agonist for 30 min The expression levels of the wild-type

double mutant displayed a greater decrease in agonist potency (EC50 8020 nM) than F310L/A293E, as well as a decrease in efficacy (Fig Consistent with these changes in PI signaling, the increased epinephrine affinity observed with the A293E mutant (Ki 0.017 M ) compared with the wild-type 1B-AR (Ki 0.75 M ), was perturbed by additional substitution of Phe310 with leucine in the F310L/A293E double mutant (Ki 1.84 M), and further decreased in the F310A/A293E double mutant (Ki 64 M ) (Fig In addition, even loss of all bonding potential with alanine substitution of Phe310 does not impair spontaneous isomerization of the receptor to a partially activated conformation, as is evident with the F310A/ A293E double mutant Total inositol phosphates generated in the absence of agonist were determined in intact COS-1 cells transfected with vector alone (mock), or plasmid encoding the wild-type (WT), or F310A or F310L mutant 1B-ARs The expression levels of the wild-type, F310A, and F310L

L/A293E double mutants support this model based on the following considerations: (i) central to the recently revised ternary complex model of GPCR activation is the finding that mutant receptors can exist in a constitutively active state that allows signaling in the absence of agonist; (ii) in support of this model is the finding that overexpression of wild-type receptors can also initiate biochemical responses in the absence of agonist; (iii) accordingly, it has been proposed that receptors spontaneously resonate between a basal state, R, and an active state, R*, with only the latter being able to productively interact with G-protein, and (iv) as a corollary, constitutively active mutants, which partially mimic the active state, represent an intermediate receptor conformation, R (26) Moreover, signaling in the absence of agonist was similar with the F310A and F310L mutants, and, importantly, was not reduced below that observed with the unliganded wildtype 1B-AR, even though these mutants markedly impaired agonist-induced signaling Since the double mutants F310A/A293E and F310L/A293E also showed similar basal signaling in the absence of agonist, but impaired agonist-induced signaling, the Phe310-catechol ring interaction is likely not required for isomerization between R and R , but is critical for full receptor activation Saturation binding and immunoblotting studies indicated that the F303A, F303L, and Y348L mutants were expressed in the plasma membrane and processed (glycosylation) at levels almost equal to the wild-type 1B-AR (Table I and

produce the quadruple mutants F310C/C128S/C129S/C137S and F311C/C128S/ C129S/C137S (Table V) By contrast with the cysteine triple mutant (IC50 for MTSEA-induced inhibition of [125I]HEAT binding, 10

was observed with D121K Since a naturally occurring mouse MC1R variant containing a TM2 lysine in a position otherwise occupied by glutamic acid is constitutively active, we examined TM3 mutant D121K for constitutive activity Transfection of equalizing amounts of receptor plasmid DNA and binding studies were used to carefully control the level of receptor expression (wild-type hMC1R cells expressing 325 fmol/mg receptor protein and D121K expressing 341 fmol/mg) No increased basal cAMP production was observed with mutant D121K compared with the wild-type hMC1R If as our model proposes there is a direct ionic interaction between the negatively charged receptor residue Asp121 and the positively charged ligand residue Arg8 of NDP-MSH, introduction of a positive charge at this receptor position (as in mutant construct D121K) should further decrease agonist binding affinity and potency compared with either D121A or D121N because of the repellent effect of such a charge substitution Indeed, mutant D121K did display a greater loss of agonist binding affinity and potency than either of those mutants Regarding the process of receptor activation the discordance between agonist affinity and potency (values of IC50 one log less than EC50) that is observed with the double (D117A/D121A) and triple (E94A/D117A/D121A) mutants as well as the mutant D121K may be mechanistically significant In the case of mutant D121K which represents alteration of only a single member of the acidic triad (Glu94, Asp117, and Asp121) the discordance between IC50 and EC50 values may be due to charge interference which hampers ligand binding After carefully controlling for the level of receptor expression we compared the basal (unstimulated) cAMP production of the wild-type hMC1R and mutant D121K and found no increased cAMP production by the latter mutant Alanine substitution of two (mutant D117A/D121A) and three (mutant E94A/D117A/D121A) of these acidic residues produced TABLE I Effect

Glu94, Asp117, and Asp121 and Arg8 of NDP-MSH we examined the effects of substituting Asp121 with asparagine or lysine (mutants D121N and D121L) Both mutations caused changes in agonist affinity and potency that were more marked than those observed for D121A (D121K D121N) Initially it was somewhat surprising to us that the asparagine substitution of Asp121 (D121N) had more marked effects than the alanine substitution (D121A) If as our model proposes there is a direct ionic interaction between the negatively charged receptor residue Asp121 and the positively charged ligand residue Arg8 of NDP-MSH, introduction of a positive charge at this receptor position (as in mutant construct D121K) should further decrease agonist binding affinity and potency compared with either D121A or D121N because of the repellent effect of such a charge substitution Alanine substitution of two (mutant D117A/D121A) and three (mutant E94A/D117A/D121A) of these acidic residues produced TABLE I Effect of

169 22.88 a NR, no response to 10 6 M agonist Both mutations caused changes in agonist affinity and potency that were more marked than those observed for D121A (D121K D121N) As with D117A/D121A and E94A/D117A/ D121A a discordance between IC50 and EC50 values was observed with D121K Initially it was somewhat surprising to us that the asparagine substitution of Asp121 (D121N) had more marked effects than the alanine substitution (D121A) If as our model proposes there is a direct ionic interaction between the negatively charged receptor residue Asp121 and the positively charged ligand residue Arg8 of NDP-MSH, introduction of a positive charge at this receptor position (as in mutant construct D121K) should further decrease agonist binding affinity and potency compared with either D121A or D121N because of the repellent effect of such a charge substitution Effect of mutations of two acidic residues in TM3 (D117A/ D121A) or all three acidic residues in TM2 of TM3 (E94A/AD117A/D121A) on agonist binding affinity (left) and potency (right) Regarding the process of receptor activation the discordance between agonist affinity and potency (values of IC50 one log less than EC50) that is observed with the double (D117A/D121A) and triple (E94A/D117A/D121A) mutants as well as the mutant D121K may be mechanistically significant Notably a similar discordance between agonist affinity and potency was not observed for the individual alanine mutations of the same residues (mutant constructs E94A, D117A, and D121A) a single mutant with substituted amino acids E94A/D117A/ D121A plus F175A/F179A/Y182A/F196A) In terms of activation it is also notable that a naturally occurring mouse MC1R variant E92K (which is analogous to Glu94 of the human receptor) is the genotypic basis for the sombre Eso-3J mutation (21) 
9927627	On the other hand, for the constitutively active D142A and D142T mutants, the basal levels of phosphorylation were similar to those of the wild-type alpha-1b AR and did not appear to be further stimulated by epinephrine For phosphorylation assays, cells were plated in 55-mm dishes (1 106 cells) for most experiments and in 100-mm dishes (3 106 cells) for experiments involving the D142A and D142T mutants To compare the phosphorylation properties of the constitutively active receptors mutated at A293 or D142, we have chosen a mutant with high (D142T and A293E) and a mutant with intermediate (D142A and A293I) levels of constitutive activity for each series of receptors We previously reported that the maximal expression levels of the D142A and D142T mutants in COS-7 cells was 3- to 4-fold lower than that of the receptors mutated at position 293 Surprisingly, the constitutively active D142A and D142T mutants displayed basal levels of phosphorylation similar to those of the wild-type alpha-1b AR and did not appear to undergo any significant epinephrine-induced increase in phosphorylation (Figs Whereas for the A293E and A293I receptors, the level of constitutive activity was correlated with their increased values of basal phosphorylation, the D142T and D142A mutants did not exhibit a significant increase in basal or agonist-induced phosphorylation despite their high levels of constitutive activity A, COS-7 cells were transfected with the cDNA encoding the wild-type alpha-1b AR (WT) or its mutants D142A, D142T, A293E, A293I and D142A/A293E B, COS-7 cells were

mutants were subcloned in pRK5 (Didsbury et al., 1991), that of GRK2 and its K220R mutant (Kong et al., 1994) in pCMV5 (Andersson et al., 1989) and that of the -arrestin-1 mutant V53D (Ferguson et al., 1996) in pCDNA1 The amount of transfected DNA encoding GRK2, its K220R mutant and the -arrestin-1 mutant V53D was 3-fold higher than that of the receptors Overexpression of GRK2, of its mutant K220R and of -arrestin-1 mutant V53D was assessed on the cytosolic fractions of transfected cells as described previously (Diviani et al., 1996) For immunodetection of the -arrestin-1 mutant V53D, the antiserum (used at 1:1000 dilution) was raised against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein encoding residues 172268 of bovine -arrestin This was supported by the finding that a dominant negative mutant of -arrestin-1 (V53D) could partially inhibit receptor internalization (Ferguson et al., 1996) Thus, the internalization of the A293E and D142A mutants was compared with that of the wild-type alpha-1b AR in the absence or presence of a dominant negative mutant of -arrestin-1 (V53D) Overexpression of the V53D -arrestin-1 mutant reduced receptor internalization to 18% Interestingly, epinephrine-induced internalization of the constitutively active A293E mutant was significantly higher than that of the wild-type alpha-1b AR and this could be partially inhibited by overexpression of the V53D -arrestin-1 mutant (Fig However, overexpression of the V53D -arrestin-1 mutant did not have any significant effect on the phosphorylation of the D142A receptor (data not shown) COS-7 cells were transfected with the cDNA encoding the alpha-1b AR (WT) or its constitutively active D142A and A293E mutants alone (control) or in combination with the -arrestin mutant (V53D) a, P .05 as compared with the wild-type alpha-1b AR in the absence of -arrestin (V53D); b, P .05 as compared with the same receptor in the absence of -arrestin (V53D) Overexpression of the V53D -arrestin-1 mutant did not significantly increase the number of cell surface receptors for any of the receptors tested as compared with receptors expressed alone (data not shown) This was mainly demonstrated by the fact that coexpression of the alpha-1b AR with the dominant negative -arrestin-1 mutant V53D inhibited receptor internalization by 40% (Fig Caron for the dominant negative mutant of -arrestin1 (V53D); and Dr The cDNA encoding the hamster alpha-1b AR (Cotecchia et al., 1988) and its mutants were subcloned in pRK5 (Didsbury et al., 1991), that of GRK2 and its K220R mutant (Kong et al., 1994) in pCMV5 (Andersson et al., 1989) and that of the -arrestin-1 mutant V53D (Ferguson et al., 1996) in pCDNA1 The amount of transfected DNA encoding GRK2, its K220R mutant and the -arrestin-1 mutant V53D was 3-fold higher than that of the receptors Overexpression of GRK2, of its mutant K220R and of -arrestin-1 mutant V53D was assessed on the cytosolic fractions of transfected cells as described previously (Diviani et al., 1996) For immunodetection of GRK2 and its mutants K220R, the antiserum (used at 1:1000 dilution) was raised against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein encoding residues 467 to 688 of rat GRK3, as described previously (Diviani et al., 1996) GRK2 or its dominant negative mutant K220R (Kong et al., 1994) were transiently coexpressed with either the wild-type or mutated receptors in COS-7 cells (Fig Benovic for the K220R mutant of GRK2; Dr For the A293E and A293I mutants the levels of agonist-independent phosphorylation were 150% and 50% higher than those of the wild-type alpha-1b AR, respectively Overexpression of the guanyl nucleotide binding regulatory protein-coupled receptor kinase GRK2 further increases the basal phosphorylation of the A293E mutant, but not that of D142A mutant Both the wild-type alpha-1b AR and the A293E mutant could undergo -arrestin-mediated internalization The epinephrine-induced internalization of the constitutively active A293E mutant was significantly higher than that of the wild-type alpha-1b AR Interestingly, a double mutant A293E/D142A retained very high constitutive activity and regulatory properties of both the A293E and D142A receptors The transfected DNA per 106 cells was 0.0251.0 g for the alpha-1b AR and A293E mutant, 3 g for the D142A receptor, 0.5 g for the -arrestin-GFP, and 1 g for GRK2 To compare the phosphorylation properties of the constitutively active receptors mutated at A293 or D142, we have chosen a mutant with high (D142T and A293E) and a mutant with intermediate (D142A and A293I) levels of constitutive activity for each series of receptors As previously reported (Kjelsberg et al., 1992; Scheer et al., 1996), the IP response mediated by the constitutively active mutants could be stimulated by epinephrine with the exception of the A293E mutant for which the agonist-induced response was observed in previous studies only at its maximal expression levels Interestingly, the levels of basal phosphorylation of the A293I and A293E mutants were 50% and 140% greater than those of the wild-type receptor, respectively Stimulation of the A293I and A293E mutants with epinephrine could also significantly increase receptor phosphorylation above basal (Figs Whereas for the A293E and A293I receptors, the level of constitutive activity was correlated with their increased values of basal phosphorylation, the D142T and D142A mutants did not exhibit a significant increase in basal or agonist-induced phosphorylation despite their high levels of constitutive activity This cluster of serines was mutated in the wild-type alpha-1b AR as well as in the A293E and D142A mutants The cluster of serines containing the main sites of phosphorylation for GRK (Ser-404, Ser-408, and Ser-410) and PKC (Ser-394 and Ser-400) was mutated in the wild-type, A293E, and D142A, so as to construct receptors the S394 to 415A, A293E/S394 to 415A, and D142A/S394 to 415A, respectively The Ki of epinephrine for the A293E/S394 to 415A and Fig A, COS-7 cells were transfected with the cDNA encoding the wild-type alpha-1b AR (WT) or its mutants D142A, D142T, A293E, A293I and D142A/A293E B, COS-7 cells were transfected with the cDNA encoding the wild-type alpha-1b AR (WT) or its mutants D142A, D142T, A293E, A293I, D142A/A293E Regulation of Alpha-1b AR Constitutively Active Mutants 341 D142A/S394 to 415A was not significantly different than that of the A293E and D142A, respectively (data not shown) These results strongly suggest that the increased basal phosphorylation of the A293E mutant mainly occurs at the same sites involved in GRK- and PKC-mediated phosphorylation of the wild-type alpha-1b AR On the other hand, for both the A293E/S394 to 415A and D142A/S394 to 415A receptors, the agonist-independent IP response was 69% and 73% higher than that of the constitutively active A293E and D142 mutants, respectively (data not shown) However, such enhancement is too small to be appreciated at the wild-type alpha-1b AR, whereas it can be observed for the A293E and D142A mutants characterized by higher efficacy as compared with the wild-type receptor (Lee et al., 1996; Perez et al., 1996) Effects of GRK2 on Phosphorylation of A293E and D142A Mutants For these studies, the A293E and D142A mutants were chosen because they displayed similar constitutive activity when expressed at similar levels (Fig Overexpression of GRK2 resulted also in a significant increase of the basal phosphorylation of the A293E that was 31% above that of the receptor expressed alone This result strongly suggests that the constitutively active A293E mutant is a substrate for GRK2-mediated phosphorylation in Fig COS-7 cells were transfected with the cDNA encoding the wild-type alpha-1b AR (WT) (lanes 1 and 2) or its mutants A293E (lanes 3 and 4) and D142A (lanes 5 and 6) COS-7 cells were transfected with the cDNA encoding the alpha-1b AR (WT), the constitutively active receptors A293E and D142A or the receptor mutants S394 to 415A, A293E/S394 to 415A and D142A/S394 to 415A in which eight serines were mutated into alanine COS-7 cells were transfected with the cDNA encoding the alpha-1b AR (WT) or its mutants D142A and A293E alone or in combination with the cDNA encoding the bovine GRK2 a, P .05 as compared with the basal phosphorylation of each respective receptor in the absence of GRK2; b, P .05 as compared with the basal phosphorylation of the wild-type alpha-1b AR in the absence of GRK2; c, P .05 as compared with the epinephrine-induced phosphorylation of each respective receptor in the absence of GRK2; d, P .05 as compared with the basal phosphorylation of the A293E in the absence of GRK2 This hypothesis is further supported by the observation that coexpression of the dominant negative GRK2 mutant resulted in 50% decrease in the agonist-independent phosphorylation of the A293E mutant (data not shown) In contrast to what was observed for the A293E receptor, the basal phosphorylation of the D142A mutant was not significantly increased in the presence of GRK2 Together these findings reveal a striking difference between the A293E and D142A constitutively active mutants with respect to their interaction with GRK2 and their ability to undergo agonist-induced phosphorylation The A293E receptor seems to be a substrate of GRK2-mediated phosphorylation both in the absence and in the presence of the agonist To further investigate the relative role of the structural domains of the alpha-1b AR including A293 and D142 we constructed a receptor mutant A293E/ D142A carrying the double mutation 1A, the D142A/A293E mutant displayed a constitutive activity that was 71% and 93% higher as compared with that of the A293E or D142A receptors, respectively On the other hand, the levels of agonist-independent phosphorylation of the A293E/D142A mutant was significantly decreased by 40% as compared with that of the A293E receptor (Fig The Ki of epinephrine for the A293E/ D142A mutant was not significantly different than that of the D142A or A293E receptors Agonist-Induced Internalization of A293E and D142A Mutants Thus, the internalization of the A293E and D142A mutants was compared with that of the wild-type alpha-1b AR in the absence or presence of a dominant negative mutant of -arrestin-1 (V53D) Interestingly, epinephrine-induced internalization of the constitutively active A293E mutant was significantly higher than that of the wild-type alpha-1b AR and this could be partially inhibited by overexpression of the V53D -arrestin-1 mutant (Fig COS-7 cells were transfected with the cDNA encoding the alpha-1b AR (WT) or its constitutively active D142A and A293E mutants alone (control) or in combination with the -arrestin mutant (V53D) The transfected DNA per 1 106 cells was 1 g for the wild-type alpha-1b AR and A293E receptors, and 3 g for the D142A Receptor expression ranged from 180 to 270 fmol per 1 106 cells for the wild-type alpha-1b AR and the A293E receptors and 60 90 fmol per 1 106 cells for the D142A Regulation of Alpha-1b AR Constitutively Active Mutants 343 It could be expected that the A293E mutant displaying increased basal phosphorylation could also be constitutively internalized in the absence of the agonist However, these observations cannot exclude a tonic internalization of the A293E receptor mutant that would be hardly measurable in our experimental approach measuring ligand binding to intact cells Interestingly, in cells expressing the constitutively active A293E mutant the cell membrane fluorescence in the absence of epinephrine was clearly more pronounced than in cells expressing similar levels of the wild-type alpha-1b AR (Fig These findings strongly suggest that in cells expressing the constitutively active A293E receptor mutant -arrestin are, at least in part, constitutively translocated to the cell membrane The translocation of -arrestin-GFP in cells expressing either the alpha-1b AR or the A293E mutant was smaller when GRK2 was not overexpressed (data not shown) Altogether these findings suggest that the enhanced basal phosphorylation of the constitutively active A293E mutant might result in the constitutive translocation of -arrestin toward the receptor that could lead to increased agonistinduced internalization of the receptor mutant HEK cells were transfected with the cDNA encoding the alpha-1b AR (A and B) or its constitutively active D142A (C and D) and A293E mutants (E and F) in combination with the cDNAs coding for -arrestin-GFP and GRK2 Receptor expression was 3 pmol/mg of protein for the alpha-1b AR and A293E, and 0.7 pmol/mg of protein for the D142A The analysis of the A293E and A293I mutants suggests a correlation between the constitutive activity induced by the mutations of Ala-293 and agonist-independent phosphorylation of the receptor (Fig Three lines of evidence suggest that the increased basal phosphorylation of the A293E mutant is, at least in part, mediated by GRK2 1) Coexpression with GRK2 significantly increased both the basal and agonist-dependent phosphorylation of the A293E receptor (Fig 2) Mutations of the phosphorylation sites on the receptor, including those for GRK2, dramatically decreased both basal and agonistinduced phosphorylation of the A293E mutant (Fig 3) Overexpression of a kinase-deficient GRK2 mutant could partially reduce the basal phosphorylation of the A293E receptor (data not shown) A293E Mutant Displays Increased -Arrestin-Mediated Internalization Interestingly, the agonist-induced internalization of the constitutively active A293E mutant was significantly increased by 68% above that of the wild-type alpha-1b AR (Fig On one hand, the efficacy of a number of full or partial agonists at the A293E mutant is greater than at the wildtype alpha-1b AR, as reported previously (Perez et al., 1996) On the other hand, our findings strongly suggest that the affinity of the A293E mutant for -arrestin is increased as compared with that of the wild-type receptor This was mainly demonstrated by the fact that in cells expressing the constitutively active A293E mutant the -arrestin-GFP conjugate was, at least in part, constitutively translocated to the cell membrane as compared with cells expressing the wildtype alpha-1b AR (Fig The constitutive translocation of -arrestin toward the receptor as well as the enhanced agonist-induced receptor internalization are consistent with the increased basal phosphorylation of the constitutively active A293E mutant In addition, the basal phosphorylation of the double mutant D142A/ A293E was still significantly higher than that of the wildtype alpha-1b AR (Fig 2) A marked degree of constitutive activity is detectable for both the A293E and D142A mutants also in a membrane assay (in which desensitization should not occur) measuring receptor-mediated stimulation of GTP 35S binding to G q (our unpublished results) However, an intriguing hypothesis is that the output of both the D142A and A293E receptor mutants results from the balance between two opposite processes--activation and desensitization On the other hand, the constitutive activity of the A293E mutant might be underestimated because of its increased desensitization For the A293E and A293I mutants the levels of agonist-independent phosphorylation were 150% and 50% higher than those of the wild-type alpha-1b AR, respectively To compare the phosphorylation properties of the constitutively active receptors mutated at A293 or D142, we have chosen a mutant with high (D142T and A293E) and a mutant with intermediate (D142A and A293I) levels of constitutive

Stimulation of the A293I and A293E mutants with epinephrine could also significantly increase receptor phosphorylation above basal (Figs Whereas for the A293E and A293I receptors, the level of constitutive activity was correlated with their increased values of basal phosphorylation, the D142T and D142A mutants did not exhibit a significant increase in basal or agonist-induced phosphorylation despite their high levels of constitutive activity A, COS-7 cells were transfected with the cDNA encoding the wild-type alpha-1b AR (WT) or its mutants D142A, D142T, A293E, A293I and

suggests a correlation between the constitutive activity induced by the mutations of Ala-293 and agonist-independent phosphorylation of the receptor (Fig On the other hand, for the constitutively active D142A and D142T mutants, the basal levels of phosphorylation were similar to those of the wild-type alpha-1b AR and did not appear to be further stimulated by epinephrine Overexpression of the guanyl nucleotide binding regulatory protein-coupled receptor kinase GRK2 further increases the basal phosphorylation of the A293E mutant, but not that of D142A mutant In contrast, the D142A mutant was impaired in its ability to interact with -arrestin and to undergo agonist-induced internalization Interestingly, a double mutant A293E/D142A retained very high constitutive activity and regulatory properties of both the A293E and D142A receptors For phosphorylation assays, cells were plated in 55-mm dishes (1 106 cells) for most experiments and in 100-mm dishes (3 106 cells) for experiments involving the D142A and D142T mutants The transfected DNA per 106 cells was 0.0251.0 g for the alpha-1b AR and A293E mutant, 3 g for the D142A receptor, 0.5 g for the -arrestin-GFP, and 1 g for GRK2 To compare the phosphorylation properties of the constitutively active receptors mutated at A293 or D142, we have chosen a mutant with high (D142T and A293E) and a mutant with intermediate (D142A and A293I) levels of constitutive activity for each series of receptors We previously reported that the maximal expression levels of the D142A and D142T mutants in COS-7 cells was 3- to 4-fold lower than that of the receptors mutated at position 293 Surprisingly, the constitutively active D142A and D142T mutants displayed basal levels of phosphorylation similar to those of the wild-type alpha-1b AR and did not appear to undergo any significant epinephrine-induced increase in phosphorylation (Figs Whereas for the A293E and A293I receptors, the level of constitutive activity was correlated with their increased values of basal phosphorylation, the D142T and D142A mutants did not exhibit a significant increase in basal or agonist-induced phosphorylation despite their high levels of

415A, respectively A, COS-7 cells were transfected with the cDNA encoding the wild-type alpha-1b AR (WT) or its mutants D142A, D142T, A293E, A293I and D142A/A293E B, COS-7 cells were transfected with

significantly different than that of the A293E and D142A, respectively (data not shown) On the other hand, for both the A293E/S394 to 415A and D142A/S394 to 415A receptors, the agonist-independent IP response was 69% and 73% higher than that of the constitutively active A293E and D142 mutants, respectively (data not shown) However, such enhancement is too small to be appreciated at the wild-type alpha-1b AR, whereas it can be observed for the A293E and D142A mutants characterized by higher efficacy as compared with the wild-type receptor (Lee et al., 1996; Perez et al., 1996) Effects of GRK2 on Phosphorylation of A293E and D142A Mutants For these studies, the A293E and D142A mutants were chosen because they displayed similar constitutive activity when expressed at similar levels (Fig COS-7 cells were transfected with the cDNA encoding the wild-type alpha-1b AR (WT) (lanes 1 and 2) or its mutants A293E (lanes 3 and 4) and D142A (lanes 5 and 6) COS-7 cells were transfected with the cDNA encoding the alpha-1b AR (WT), the constitutively active receptors A293E and D142A or the receptor mutants S394 to 415A, A293E/S394 to 415A and D142A/S394 to 415A in which eight serines were mutated into alanine COS-7 cells were transfected with the cDNA encoding the alpha-1b AR (WT) or its mutants D142A and A293E alone or in combination with the cDNA encoding the bovine GRK2 Overexpression of the dominant negative GRK2 mutant partially impaired epinephrine-induced phosphorylation of the wild-type alpha-1b AR in agreement with previous findings (Diviani et al., 1996), but did not have any effect on that of the D142A mutant In contrast to what was observed for the A293E receptor, the basal phosphorylation of the D142A mutant was not significantly increased in the presence of GRK2 1B, stimulation of the D142A receptor with epinephrine did not significantly increase receptor phosphorylation However, a significant 50% increase of agonist-induced phosphorylation of the D142A above basal could be observed in cells overexpressing GRK2 (Fig Together these findings reveal a striking difference between the A293E and D142A constitutively active mutants with respect to their interaction with GRK2 and their ability to undergo agonist-induced phosphorylation On the other hand, the D142A mutant might be impaired in its interaction with GRK2 To further investigate the relative role of the structural domains of the alpha-1b AR including A293 and D142 we constructed a receptor mutant A293E/ D142A carrying the double mutation 1A, the D142A/A293E mutant displayed a constitutive activity that was 71% and 93% higher as compared with that of the A293E or D142A receptors, respectively On the other hand, the levels of agonist-independent phosphorylation of the A293E/D142A mutant was significantly decreased by 40% as compared with that of the A293E receptor (Fig The Ki of epinephrine for the A293E/ D142A mutant was not significantly different than that of the D142A or A293E receptors Agonist-Induced Internalization of A293E and D142A Mutants Thus, the internalization of the A293E and D142A mutants was compared with that of the wild-type alpha-1b AR in the absence or presence of a dominant negative mutant of -arrestin-1 (V53D) On the other hand, the D142A receptor mutant was impaired in its ability to undergo epinephrineinduced internalization that was never 6% However, overexpression of the V53D -arrestin-1 mutant did not have any significant effect on the phosphorylation of the D142A receptor (data not shown) COS-7 cells were transfected with the cDNA encoding the alpha-1b AR (WT) or its constitutively active D142A and A293E mutants alone (control) or in combination with the -arrestin mutant (V53D) The transfected DNA per 1 106 cells was 1 g for the wild-type alpha-1b AR and A293E receptors, and 3 g for the D142A Receptor expression ranged from 180 to 270 fmol per 1 106 cells for the wild-type alpha-1b AR and the A293E receptors and 60 90 fmol per 1 106 cells for the D142A On the other hand, agonist-induced stimulation of the constitutively active D142A receptor mutant did not induce any apparent translocation of the -arrestin-GFP that remained diffused throughout the cytosol both in the absence and presence of epinephrine (Fig To rule out that the reduced signal in the -arrestin-GFP translocation assay in cells expressing the D142A receptor derived from the lower expression of this mutant, arrestin translocation was compared in HEK cells expressing similar levels of D142A and wild-type alpha-1b AR However, when the alpha-1b AR was expressed at levels similar to those of the D142A agonist-induced translocation of arrestin was observed in cells expressing the wild type, but not in those expressing the mutated receptor (Fig On the other hand, the decreased ability of the D142A to undergo agonistinduced phosphorylation might result in its apparent lack of interaction with -arrestin HEK cells were transfected with the cDNA encoding the alpha-1b AR (A and B) or its constitutively active D142A (C and D) and A293E mutants (E and F) in combination with the cDNAs coding for -arrestin-GFP and GRK2 Receptor expression was 3 pmol/mg of protein for the alpha-1b AR and A293E, and 0.7 pmol/mg of protein for the D142A In fact, overexpression of GRK2 could partially rescue the phosphorylation of the D142A mutant resulting in a significant increase of epinephrine-induced phosphorylation of the receptor (Fig In addition, the basal phosphorylation of the double mutant D142A/ A293E was still significantly higher than that of the wildtype alpha-1b AR (Fig The expression of the D142A mutant was 3- to 5-fold lower than that of the wild-type alpha-1b AR Fluorescence microscopy of -arrestin-GFP distribution

the cDNAs coding for -arrestin-GFP and GRK2 The transfected DNA per 1 106 cells was 3 g for the D142A, 0.025 g for the alpha-1b AR in C and D, and 0.1 g for the alpha-1b AR in E and F Receptor expression was 2 pmol/mg of protein for the D142A and for the alpha-1b AR in C and D, and 4 pmol/mg of protein for the alpha-1b AR in E and F One might speculate that constitutive internalization might be responsible for the apparent lack of agonist-induced internalization of the constitutively active D142A mutant 1) Overexpression of the dominant negative mutant of -arrestin-1 did not increase the expression of the D142A mutant at the cell surface or agonist-induced phosphorylation of the receptor (data not shown) 2) in HEK cells that express high amounts of -arrestin agonist-induced stimulation of the D142A receptor did not induce any apparent translocation of the -arrestin-GFP conjugate to the cell membrane (Figs An important question is to what extent the apparent constitutive activity of the D142A mutant reflects enhanced activation versus reduced desensitization In addition, several lines of evidence seem to exclude that reduced desensitization is the main mechanism underlying the high degree of constitutive activity of the D142A mutant 2) A marked degree of constitutive activity is detectable for both the A293E and D142A mutants also in a membrane assay (in which desensitization should not occur) measuring receptor-mediated stimulation of GTP 35S binding to G q (our unpublished results) However, an intriguing hypothesis is that the output of both the D142A and A293E receptor mutants results from the balance between two opposite processes--activation and desensitization On one hand, the constitutive activity of the D142A mutant

phosphorylation and internalization suggests that, among the multiple conformations underlying receptor activation, not all favor the interaction of the receptor with GRK2 and/or -arrestin 
10860933	In the second mutant, two Ser residues in TM domain 5 (positions 194 and 197) were mutated to Ala residues and are designated Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR The construction of the Asp114Asn D2DR and Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR mutant receptors and their insertion into mammalian expression vectors have been described previously (Mansour et al., 1992) [3H]Nemonapride saturation binding was performed on membranes from COS-7 cells transiently expressing D2DR, Asp114Asn D2DR, or Ser194Ala/ Ser197Ala D2DR or coexpressing Asp114Asn D2DR and Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR Autoradiogram showing photoaffinity labeling by [125I]-azido-YM of membranes from COS-7 cells expressing D2DR (lanes 1 and 2), D2DR Asp114Asn D2DR (lanes 3 and 4), and D2DR Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR (lanes 5 and 6), and coexpressing D2DR Asp114Asn D2DR and D2DR Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR (lanes 7 and 8) Results Coexpression of Asp114Asn and Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR Mutants In cells expressing the Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR, agonist binding was diminished compared with wild-type D2DR, but nemonapride binding was not significantly different (Fig We hypothesized that, as a result of TM domain swapping, the number of detected binding sites would increase on coexpression of Asp114Asn D2DR with Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR because of the reconstitution of intact binding pockets (Fig However, when the point mutants were coexpressed, radioligand-detected receptor density was significantly diminished compared with that of cells only expressing Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR Densitometry showed that labeling of receptor monomer was reduced by 60% in cells coexpressing Asp114Asn D2DR and Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR compared with cells expressing Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR alone and that there was a 70% reduction in labeling of the receptor dimer It was observed that coexpression of the Asp114Asn D2DR with the Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR decreased the radioligand-detected receptor density When this mutant was coexpressed with Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR, which, when expressed alone, bound antagonist with high affinity, the number of binding sites was decreased This indicated that the function of the visualized monomeric and dimeric Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR was impaired The Asp residue in TM domain 3 (position 114) of the D2DR was mutated to Asn and is designated Asp114Asn The construction of the Asp114Asn D2DR and Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR mutant receptors and their insertion into mammalian expression vectors have been described previously (Mansour et al., 1992) [3H]Nemonapride saturation binding was performed on membranes from COS-7 cells transiently expressing D2DR, Asp114Asn D2DR, or Ser194Ala/ Ser197Ala D2DR or coexpressing Asp114Asn D2DR and Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR Autoradiogram showing photoaffinity labeling by [125I]-azido-YM of membranes from COS-7 cells expressing D2DR (lanes 1 and 2), D2DR Asp114Asn D2DR (lanes 3 and 4), and D2DR Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR (lanes 5 and 6), and coexpressing D2DR Asp114Asn D2DR and D2DR Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR (lanes 7 and 8) Results Coexpression of Asp114Asn and Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR Mutants Radioligand binding with the agonists [3H]dopamine and [3H]N-propyl-apomorphine and with the antagonist [3H]nemonapride was undetectable in cells expressing Asp114Asn D2DR (Fig We hypothesized that, as a result of TM domain swapping, the number of detected binding sites would increase on coexpression of Asp114Asn D2DR with Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR because of the reconstitution of intact binding pockets (Fig D2DR density detected by [3H]nemonapride binding in membranes from COS-7 cells transiently transfected with D2DR cDNA and increasing amounts of Asp114Asn D2DR cDNA The ratio of D2DR cDNA to Asp114Asn D2DR cDNA is indicated Densitometry showed that labeling of receptor monomer was reduced by 60% in cells coexpressing Asp114Asn D2DR and Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR compared with cells expressing Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR alone and that there was a 70% reduction in labeling of the receptor dimer Coexpression of Asp114Asn D2DR and Wild-Type D2DR Because coexpression of the Asp114Asn D2DR with the Ser194Ala/Ser197/Ala D2DR decreased the radioliganddetected receptor density, we examined the effects of Asp114Asn D2DR on the wild-type receptor When Asp114Asn D2DR was coexpressed with wild-type D2DR, radioliganddetected receptor density was attenuated (Fig As the ratio of Asp114Asn D2DR cDNA to wild-type D2DR cDNA used for transfection increased, the degree of binding inhibition also increased Coexpression of D2N and Asp114Asn D2DR adrenergic receptor chimera (Maggio et al., 1993a; Gouldson et al., 1997), coexpression of D2N with Asp114Asn would result in the recovery of D2DR binding (Fig To determine whether the coexpression of Asp114Asn D2DR with D2N could result in the recovery of ligand binding, cells coexpressing the receptor fragment and the point mutant were subjected to saturation binding assays using [3H]N-propyl-apomorphine and [3H]nemonapride It was observed that coexpression of the Asp114Asn D2DR with the Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR decreased the radioligand-detected receptor density To further test this, the Asp114Asn D2DR, D2N, and D2C were each coexpressed with wild-type D2DR The mutant Asp114Asn D2DR is incapable of binding ligand because of the substitution of the critical amino acid in TM domain 3 In the second mutant, two Ser residues in TM domain 5 (positions 194 and 197) were mutated to Ala residues and are designated Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR The construction of the Asp114Asn D2DR and Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR mutant receptors and their insertion into mammalian expression vectors have been described previously (Mansour et al., 1992) [3H]Nemonapride saturation binding was performed on membranes from COS-7 cells transiently expressing D2DR, Asp114Asn D2DR, or Ser194Ala/ Ser197Ala D2DR or coexpressing Asp114Asn D2DR and Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR Autoradiogram showing photoaffinity labeling by [125I]-azido-YM of membranes from COS-7 cells expressing D2DR (lanes 1 and 2), D2DR Asp114Asn D2DR (lanes 3 and 4), and D2DR Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR (lanes 5 and 6), and coexpressing D2DR Asp114Asn D2DR and D2DR Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR (lanes 7 and 8) Results Coexpression of Asp114Asn and Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR Mutants In cells expressing the Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR, agonist binding was diminished compared with wild-type D2DR, but nemonapride binding was not significantly different (Fig We hypothesized that, as a result of TM domain swapping, the number of detected binding sites would increase on coexpression of Asp114Asn D2DR with Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR because of the reconstitution of intact binding pockets (Fig However, when the point mutants were coexpressed, radioligand-detected receptor density was significantly diminished compared with that of cells only expressing Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR Densitometry showed that labeling of receptor monomer was reduced by 60% in cells coexpressing Asp114Asn D2DR and Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR compared with cells expressing Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR alone and that there was a 70% reduction in labeling of the receptor dimer Because coexpression of the Asp114Asn D2DR with the Ser194Ala/Ser197/Ala D2DR decreased the radioliganddetected receptor density, we examined the effects of Asp114Asn D2DR on the wild-type receptor It was observed that coexpression of the Asp114Asn D2DR with the Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR decreased the radioligand-detected receptor density When this mutant was coexpressed with Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR, which, when expressed alone, bound antagonist with high affinity, the number of binding sites was decreased This indicated that the function of the visualized monomeric and dimeric Ser194Ala/Ser197Ala D2DR was impaired

mutant CaRs (R185Q and R795W) exert dominant negative effects on the coexpressed wild-type CaR (wt) in cotransfected HEK cells (6) Enhancement of the [Ca2 ]o-Sensing Capability of the Mutant CaR, R185Q, by Cotransfection with the Truncated CaR, A877Stop R185Q is another mutation located within the CaR's ECD, which partially inactivates the CaR Unlike G143E and E297K, the mutant CaR, R185Q, elicits significant increases in [Ca2 ]i and IPs in response to extremely high concentrations of [Ca2 ]o with a defined EC50 (6, 8) To demonstrate that heterodimerization with A877Stop has positive effects on the partially active R185Q, we cotransfected A877Stop and R185Q 4, the mutant CaR, R185Q, elicited a maximal cumulative response of about 36% of that of wt with an elevated EC50 of 26 mM Cotransfection of R185Q with A877Stop increased the maximal [Ca2 ]i FIG The apparent Hill coefficients for R185Q and R185Q A877Stop were the same, 2.8, and were slightly less than for wt, 3.0 A877Stop could be coimmunoprecipitated with the cotransfected R185Q and did not significantly change surface expression of the cotransfected R185Q compared with that of singly transfected R185Q (data not shown) Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the heterodimeric CaRs (R185Q A877Stop) were likely to be the signaltransducing species producing the initial [Ca2 ]i response when [Ca2 ]o was increased from 5.5 to 10 mM in the cotransfected cells, because no significant [Ca2 ]i response was observed in cells transfected with R185Q or A877Stop alone in response to a similar change in

the human CB2 (wild-type), K109A or K109R receptors in HEK-293 cells In contrast to what had been found with the analogous lysine mutation in the CB1 receptor, [3H]CP-55,940 binding was unaffected in

1) The Ki values, shown in Table 2, demonstrate that the binding profile using these compounds in the K109A mutant cell lines is similar to that in wild-type CB2-transfected cells That the K109A receptor is fully functional is demonstrated by the potencies and maximal inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP with WIN 55,2122 (2.5 1.7 nM, 95% inhibition at 1 M) and CP55,940 (6.9 1.6 nM, 95%

positively stained cells was observed when compared with wild-type and K109A mutant-transfected cells Untransfected HEK-293 cells, CB2, and K109A transfected cells incubated with normal rabbit immunoglobulin G exhibited minimal fluorescence However, the fact that the K109A mutation in CB2 produces results very different from those of the corresponding CB1 mutation is an unexpected, intriguing, finding However, in the absence of this interaction site in the K109A mutant, an alternate binding mode with other residues within the pore of the transmembrane bundle is possible To test the hypothesis that Ser3.31(112) provides a critical hydrogen-bonding interaction in K109A, we constructed the K109AS112G double mutant The K109AS112G mutants lost the ability to bind CP-55,940,

K109AS112G double mutant Wild-type CB2 and K109A-transfected cells exhibited a pattern of immunostaining consistent with membrane-associated protein expression on the cell surface These findings are supported pharmacologically by the ligand binding and cAMP data that revealed comparable affinity and absolute levels of receptors for the K109A mutant when compared with the wild-type CB2-expressing cell line Collectively, these data suggest that the K109A mutant CB2 receptors are processed, transported, and compartmentalized in a normal fashion consistent with functional coupling On the other hand, cells transfected with the K109AS112G double mutant demonstrated an accumulation of immunostaining in a perinuclear arrangement To determine whether this analogous lysine residue was involved in

mutant cell line exhibited wild-type [3H]CP-55,940 binding (Kd 1.68 0.29 nM and Bmax 1.00 0.21 pmol/mg protein, Table 1) Similarly, the K109R cell line exhibited wild-type EC50s and inhibition of

at position 3.28(109) within the CB2 transmembrane bundle, the lack of an effect on ligand binding and efficacy may not be surprising These authors also found that only the conservative mutation K192R

9360556	In the case of the single amino acid deletion at codon 619 combined with an amino acid substitution at codon 620 (Thr620Ser), no constitutive activity was reported (19), whereas the recently identified deletion of four amino acids in the third extracellular loop (Del 658 661) displayed constitutive activity (17) TSHR mutations were localized in the third intracellular loop (Asp619Gly and Ala623Val), the sixth transmembrane segment (Phe631Leu and Thr632Ile, Asp633Glu) and the second extracellular loop (Ile568Thr) Distribution of TSHR mutations showed a predominance in the third intracellular loop (Asp619Gly and Ala623Val) and the sixth transmembrane TSHR segment (Phe631Leu, Thr632Ile, and Asp633Glu) One involves codon 656 in the third extracellular loop (Val656Phe) Cloning of new TSHR mutations Exon 10 of the TSHR gene was amplified by PCR, using genomic DNA extracted from the TTNs with the Val656Phe and Del613621 TSHR mutations as template The mutation at codon 656 (Val656Phe) showed a 4- to 5-fold increase in basal cAMP (10.6 2.0 pmol/well) compared to the wild-type TSHR (2.3 0.17 pmol/well) and a similar response to maximal TSH stimulation (31.9 3.1 and 29.0 5.8 pmol/well for the mutant receptor and the wildtype receptor, respectively; Fig Binding experiments showed similar binding capacities (Bmax) for the wild-type and Val656Phe mutant receptors (0.43 0.09 and 0.54 0.07, respectively), but a markedly decreased Bmax for the deletion (0.089 0.01) The Kd values (2.57 0.5 and 2.02 0.25 for the wild-type and Val656Phe mutant receptors, respectively) showed similar affinity for bovine TSH * The newly identified mutations in our study are Val656Phe and Del 613 621 As the Val656Phe mutation displays a 4- to 5-fold increase in basal cAMP levels, it is a mutation with a relatively high constitutive activity Antisense sequence of exon 10 of the TSHR in the toxic thyroid nodule with the Val656Phe mutation and corresponding antisense sequence of the wild-type receptor amplified from the adjacent normal thyroid tissue in the same patient One mutation was found in the extracellular TSHR domain (Ser281Asn) This TSHR mutation affects residue 281 in exon 9 (Ser281Asn) and has only very recently been reported by other investigators (17) TSHR mutations were localized in the third intracellular loop (Asp619Gly and Ala623Val), the sixth transmembrane segment (Phe631Leu and Thr632Ile, Asp633Glu) and the second extracellular loop (Ile568Thr) Distribution of TSHR mutations showed a predominance in the third intracellular loop (Asp619Gly and Ala623Val) and the sixth transmembrane TSHR segment (Phe631Leu, Thr632Ile, and Asp633Glu) TSHR mutations were localized in the third intracellular loop (Asp619Gly and Ala623Val), the sixth transmembrane segment (Phe631Leu and Thr632Ile, Asp633Glu) and the second extracellular loop (Ile568Thr) Distribution of TSHR mutations showed a predominance in the third intracellular loop (Asp619Gly and Ala623Val) and the sixth transmembrane TSHR segment (Phe631Leu, Thr632Ile, and Asp633Glu) the Asp619Gly and the Ala623Val mutations In contrast, the other hitherto identified point mutation in the third extracellular TSHR loop (Asn650Tyr) shows only a 2-fold increase in basal cAMP levels (4) To confirm the absence of gsp mutations at the previously described mutational hot spots at codons 201 and 227 (2, 15, 17, 18), an allele-specific PCR was performed for the mutations Arg201His/Cys and Gly227His/Arg TSHR mutations were localized in the third intracellular loop (Asp619Gly and Ala623Val), the sixth transmembrane segment (Phe631Leu and Thr632Ile, Asp633Glu) and the second extracellular loop (Ile568Thr) Distribution of TSHR mutations showed a predominance in the third intracellular loop (Asp619Gly and Ala623Val) and the sixth transmembrane TSHR segment (Phe631Leu, Thr632Ile, and Asp633Glu) TSHR mutations were localized in the third intracellular loop (Asp619Gly and Ala623Val), the sixth transmembrane segment (Phe631Leu and Thr632Ile, Asp633Glu) and the second extracellular loop (Ile568Thr) Distribution of TSHR mutations showed a predominance in the third intracellular loop (Asp619Gly and Ala623Val) and the sixth transmembrane TSHR segment (Phe631Leu, Thr632Ile, and Asp633Glu) the Asp619Gly and the Ala623Val mutations TSHR mutations were localized in the third intracellular loop (Asp619Gly and Ala623Val), the sixth transmembrane segment (Phe631Leu and Thr632Ile, Asp633Glu) and the second extracellular loop (Ile568Thr) One TSHR mutation was found in the second extracellular loop (Ile568Thr; Fig 
9360555	The absence of the Ser505Asn mutation in all other family members identifies the child's TSHR mutation as a sporadic germline mutation The Kd values (2.57 0.5 and 1.91 0.3 for the wild-type and mutant receptors, respectively) also showed similar affinities of the wild-type and Ser505Asn mutant TSHR for bTSH The amino acid transition in the mutated thyrotropin receptor of this child (Ser505Asn) is located in a position that has previously been found mutated to a different amino acid (Ser505Arg) in a case of autosomal dominant nonautoimmune hyperthyroidism (9) The Ser505Asn mutation showed a 5-fold increase in basal cAMP accumulation compared to the wild-type receptor, whereas the increase was only 2-fold for the Ser505Arg mutation (9) In vitro, all three sporadic mutations showed increased basal cAMP levels in comparison to the wild-type TSH receptor (7-fold basal cAMP for Met435Thr, 5- to 6-fold basal cAMP for Phe631Leu, and 5-fold basal cAMP for Ser505Asn) The amino acid transition in the mutated thyrotropin receptor of this child (Ser505Asn) is located in a position that has previously been found mutated to a different amino acid (Ser505Arg) in a case of autosomal dominant nonautoimmune hyperthyroidism (9) This child, therefore, presents a more active phenotype compared to the relatively mild phenotype of the familial Ser505Arg mutation (9, 11) The Ser505Asn mutation showed a 5-fold increase in basal cAMP accumulation compared to the wild-type receptor, whereas the increase was only 2-fold for the Ser505Arg mutation (9) In vitro, all three sporadic mutations showed increased basal cAMP levels in comparison to the wild-type TSH receptor (7-fold basal cAMP for Met435Thr, 5- to 6-fold basal cAMP for Phe631Leu, and 5-fold basal cAMP for Ser505Asn) The in vitro activity of the Phe631Leu mutation was directly compared with those of other sporadic and germline TSH receptor mutations in parallel transfection experiments (19) The fetal onset of hyperthyroidism for the Phe631Leu sporadic germline mutation does not correlate with its lower specific constitutive activity compared to that of the Cys672Tyr mutation, for which the earliest onset of hyperthyroidism was reported at the age of 18 months In vitro, all three sporadic mutations showed increased basal cAMP levels in comparison to the wild-type TSH receptor (7-fold basal cAMP for Met435Thr, 5- to 6-fold basal cAMP for Phe631Leu, and 5-fold basal cAMP for Ser505Asn) The fetal onset of hyperthyroidism for the Phe631Leu sporadic germline mutation does not correlate with its lower specific constitutive activity compared to that of the Cys672Tyr mutation, for which the earliest onset of hyperthyroidism was reported at the age of 18 months Even more significant differences were described for the in vitro activities for the Ile486Phe or Met mutations (5) 
9329388	The P556L mutation of the hyt/hyt mouse (6), resulting in severe hypothyroidism due to loss of hormone binding (7), is indicated as well (filled circles) The phenotype of this patient with congenital hypothyroidism and thyroid hypoplasia differs from the clinical picture of three siblings identified to be compound heterozygote for two different TSHR mutations in the extracellular domain (P162A/I167N), who were characterized to have normal thyroid function with elevated TSH levels and normal thyroid volume (9) The phenotype of this patient with congenital hypothyroidism and thyroid hypoplasia differs from the clinical picture of three siblings identified to be compound heterozygote for two different TSHR mutations in the extracellular domain (P162A/I167N), who were characterized to have normal thyroid function with elevated TSH levels and normal thyroid volume (9) Loss of function mutations in exon 6 of the human TSHR gene (9) (I162N, P167T) leading to hyporesponsiveness to TSH are indicated as filled circles The position of the missense point mutation of the patient under study is indicated as an enlarged open circle (C390W) Thus, the PCR fragment containing the paternal mutation (TSHR-C390W) was digested with MscI/Bsu36I; the fragment containing the maternal mutant (TSH-R-419trunc) was cut with MscI/BstEII Cell clones were tested for the expression of wild-type and mutant TSHR-C390W receptor in functional assays In the case of TSHR-C390W, only 5 of 14 stable cell clones showed TSH-inducible cAMP accumulation, with a range of 7- to 13-fold stimulation above basal In transiently transfected COS-7 cells, stimulation of the wild-type receptor and of the paternal mutant TSHR-C390W with saturating concentrations of TSH resulted in a robust increase in agonist-induced cAMP accumulation (Table 2) However, dose-response curves for TSH were shifted toward higher agonist concentrations in the case of TSHR-C390W compared to the wild-type reFIG The approximately 20-fold greater potency of TSH acting at the wild-type compared to the mutant (TSHR-C390W) receptor was the functional correlate of binding characteristics that were monitored in parallel (Fig increase in cAMP levels (-fold above basal) EC50 for bTSH (nmol/L) COS-7 (transient) wtTSH-R 12.0 2.0 0.19 0.02 5.6 0.4 0.7 0.3 TSHR-C390W 17.7 6.7 2.98 0.77 4.4 0.4 16.2 1.7 TSHR-419trunc --a -- --b -- CHO-K1 (permanent) wtTSHR 14.5 4.5 0.06 0.01 26.7 2.2 1.6 0.8 TSHR-C390W 100 50 4.71 2.2 13.0 1.6 30.7 2.9 TSHR-419trunc --a -- --b -- Wild-type and mutant TSH receptors were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells and permanently expressed in CHO-K1 cells In accordance with data obtained in COS-7 cells, the concentration of TSH required to half-maximally increase cAMP accumulation was approximately 20-fold higher in cells expressing the wild-type receptor compared to those expressing the TSHR-C390W mutant (Fig It is noteworthy, however, that to be able to detect agonist-induced cAMP accumulation in stably transfected CHO cells at all, TSHR-C390W clones had to be chosen that display 5- to 7-fold higher receptor densities than wild-type clones (Table 2) In binding studies performed in parallel, the reduced potency and efficacy of TSH interacting with the paternal mutant receptor were reflected by a drastically reduced affinity of TSHR-C390W to [125I]bTSH (Fig cAMP determinations (A and C) and [125I]bTSH displacement studies (B and D) were performed in COS-7 (transient transfection, A and B) and CHO-K1 (permanent expression, C and D) cells transfected with wild-type TSHR (f), TSHR-C390W (,), and TSHR-419trunc (E) cDNAs JCE & M 1997 Vol 82 No 10 abilized COS-7 cells transfected with a cDNA coding for the wild-type TSHR and for TSHR-C390W showed an intense staining of the plasma membrane (Fig After transient transfection of COS-7 cells, all three receptor proteins (wildtype, TSHR-C390W, and TSHR-419trunc) were expressed at similar levels (optical density at 492 nm 0.71.1) Cells expressing the wild-type TSHR (A and B), the TSHR-C390W (C and D), and the truncated TSHR (TSHR-419trunc: E and F) were probed with a monoclonal antibody (2C11) directed against the N-terminal portion of the human TSHR Functional characterization of the mutant paternal TSHR harboring a missense mutation at nucleotide position 1170 revealed a loss of affinity and a subsequent loss of potency of TSH acting at the mutant TSHR-C390W Thus, it was not surprising that the disruption of a putative disulfide bridge and the introduction of a bulky hydrophobic indol ring into a hydrophilic environment, as realized in the mutant TSHRC390W, interfered with hormone binding and signal transduction of the mutant receptor In contrast to studies with the wild-type receptor, TSH-induced cAMP accumulation via the mutant TSHR-C390W was hardly detectable if expressed at comparably low densities (10 50 fmol/mg protein) Therefore, we had to resort to a stable cell line homogeneously expressing higher densities of mutant receptors to functionally characterize TSHR-C390W In summary, one may surmise that in thyroid follicular cells, signal transduction involving TSHR-C390W is severely impaired regardless of elevated serum TSH concentrations The low residual T4 secretion observed in our patient may result from the residual signal transduction capability of the paternal TSHRC390W and may reflect basal T4 secretion as well The father and one younger sister who bear the TSHRC390W mutation were euthyroid
