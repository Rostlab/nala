mM, Hill n 2.0 0.3; hCaR(C60S)-GFP, 29 cells, EC50 2.9 0.19 mM, Hill n 2.8 0.6; hCaR(C131S)-GFP, 22 cells, EC50 4.0 0.33 mM, Hill n 2.2 0.39; hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP, 29 cells from at least five cells from at least two independent experiments for each mutant such that the average 340/380 ratio was 1; a, hCaR-GFP ( 340/380 ratio 1.02 0.05); b, hCaR(C60S)-GFP ( 340/380 ratio 1.06 0.04); c, hCaR(C131S)-GFP ( 340/ 380 ratio 1.12 0.03); d, hCaR(C101S/ C236S)-GFP ( 340/380 ratio 1.02 0.05) The double point mutant hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP was expressed more robustly than either C101S or C236S and covalent dimerization was eliminated hCaR(C101S/ C236S)-GFP had a decreased affinity for extracellular Ca2 and slower response kinetics upon increases or decreases in agonist concentration We found that the double point mutant hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP can be observed on SDS gels as a monomer in the absence of reducing agents Finally, we demonstrate that hCaR(C101S/ C236S)-GFP is functional when heterologously expressed in HEK 293 cells but displays a decreased affinity for agonist and significantly slower kinetics of activation and deactivation Point mutations converting cysteine residues into serine (C60S, C101S, C131S, and C236S) were individually introduced into the hCaR-GFP construct by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (38) The double point mutation (C101S/C236S) was made by performing a second round of mutagenesis in the background of the C101S point mutant We therefore made the double point mutation hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP Direct comparison of C101S, C236S, and C101S/C236S (Fig Membranes (3 g/lane) isolated from HEK 293 cells transfected with hCaR(C60S)-GFP (a), hCaR(C101S)-GFP (b), hCaR(C131S)-GFP (c), hCaR(C236S)-GFP (d), or hCaR(C101S/C236S)- GFP (e) were run either under nonreducing conditions ( ) or in the presence of 100 mM -mercaptoethanol ( ) on 4 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels Dimer/monomer comparisons for C101S, C236S, and C101S/C236S mutations Samples were hCaR(C101S)-GFP (12 g/lane) (a), hCaR(C236S)- GFP (12 g/lane) (b), and hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP (5 g/lane) (c) Cysteine Residues Contributing to CaR Dimerization 11631 Noncovalent Dimerization of hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP-- To ascertain whether hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP was correctly folded and processed, we determined its cellular localization by assessing GFP fluorescence (localization was comparable to that of wild type hCaR (37), data not shown), its ability to form noncovalent dimers, and its ability to activate Gq, resulting in increases in intracellular Ca2 (described below) hCaR(C101S/ C236S)-FLAG and hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP were transiently coexpressed in HEK 293 cells, and membranes were isolated To confirm that these results signify specific noncovalent dimerization of hCaR(C101S/C236S)-FLAG and hCaR(C101S/ C236S)-GFP, two control experiments were performed, as illustrated in Fig First, membranes isolated from HEK 293 cells transfected with hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP were immunoprecipitated with either the anti-FLAG (F) or anti-GFP (G) antibody, and the Western blot was probed with the antiGFP antibody (Fig These results suggest that hCaR(C101S/C236S)-FLAG and hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP form noncovalent dimers when coexpressed in HEK 293 cells Functional Consequences of Cys 3 Ser Mutations in CaR ECD--The functional consequences of cysteine 3 serine mutations were examined for those receptor mutations that expressed robustly in HEK 293 cells, namely, C60S, C131S, and C101S/C236S 6a), hCaR(C60S)-GFP (b), hCaR(C131S)-GFP (c), and hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP (d) In contrast, the dose/response relationship for Ca2 -dependent activation of hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP was linear over the range of Ca2 from 0.5 to 30 mM (Fig Similar experiments were performed on hCaR(C101S)-GFP and hCaR(C236S)-GFP, but expression levels were extremely low (as corroborated by the Western blots illustrated in Fig Although sufficient data could not be obtained, a few positive cells for each clone presented behavior qualitatively similar to hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP, i.e A second feature unique to hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP is a distinct difference in the kinetics of the response to extracellular Ca2 In contrast, the responses of hCaR(C101S/ C236S)-GFP were slow (Fig Furthermore, the kinetics of washout from 30 to 0.5 mM Ca2 were also slow for hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP, taking 81.6 3.5 s for the intracellular Ca2 to drop from the level in 30 mM bath Ca2 to the baseline intracellular Ca2 observed in 0.5 mM bath Ca2 Noncovalent dimerization of

immunoprecipitation of a membrane preparation derived from HEK 293 cells transfected with hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP When a construct containing both point mutations, C101S/C236S, was expressed, protein levels were significantly increased, and dimerization was eliminated in the absence/presence of reducing agents Our conclusion is based upon several criteria: 1) hCaR(C101S/C236S) is present as a monomer in the absence/presence of reducing agents; 2) expression levels of the single point mutations, hCaR(C101S), and hCaR(C236S) are weak, and monomerization, although present, is variable, whereas the double point mutation hCaR (C101S/C236S) expresses more robustly and is present as a monomer in the absence of reduction (these results are reminiscent of what has been observed in mutagenesis studies designed to identified partners in salt bridges in proteins, i.e Mutants examined were hCaR-GFP (closed circles), hCaR(C60S)-GFP (closed triangles), hCaR(C131S)-GFP (closed diamonds), and hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP (closed inverted triangles) Lines represent fits of averaged data to the Hill equation for all clones except hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP Fit parameters were as follows:

albeit with alterations in properties; and, finally, 5) hCaR(C101S/C236S) folds in a manner that maintains noncovalent dimerization of the receptor Now that the residues contributing to covalent dimerization of CaR have been identified, the contribution(s) of noncovalent interactions to CaR function can be addressed in the hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP background Studies on hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP reveal a significant contribution(s) of disulfide bond-mediated dimerization to normal hCaR function Significantly higher concentrations of Ca2 are required for modest activation of hCaR(C101S/C236S)- GFP The most striking difference in the behavior of hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP was the slowing of response kinetics to both increases and decreases in extracellular Ca2 The double point mutant

(Tables 2 and 3) Increasing intrinsic activity (defined as the maximum K channel current elicited by an opioid ligand relative to the full agonist DAMGO) at H297N was observed for the alkaloid antagonist structure-activity series proceeding from naloxone to naltrexone to diprenorphine (Fig The effect of DEPC pretreatment of wild-type (WT), H297N, and H297Q receptors on [3H]DAMGO binding (5

exhibit similar agonist properties at H297N (Fig The continuum of increased "antagonist" intrinsic activity at the H297N receptor, extending from naloxone to naltrexone to diprenorphine, also extended beyond diprenorphine to buprenorphine, a documented receptor partial agonist (27) The increased intrinsic activity of buprenorphine was quantified at 43 6.4% of the normorphine peak amplitude at the

H297N and H297Q receptors with the wild-type receptor, whereas the EC50 value for morphine was several-fold higher when His297 was replaced with asparagine The intrinsic activities of the peptide

affinities within 1 order of magnitude of the wild-type receptor The affinity constants (Table 1) obtained for binding of nonradioactive alkaloid opiates and opioid peptides at the H297N and H297Q receptors suggest that although no single property of the histidine side chain accounts for its role, side chain length and hydrogen bonding potential at this position may be critical in retaining ligand binding at or near wildtype levels The hydrogen bonding potential may be especially important; the leucine substitution mutant (H297L), lacking this potential but essentially isosteric with the asparagine side chain of the H297N receptor, was considerably less effective than H297N in binding certain ligands Although the aspartic acid and glutamic acid side chains offer - and -oxygen atoms for hydrogen bonding, respectively, their anionic character likely creates a charge repulsion that accounts for their ranking immediately after H297Q and H297N Classic opiate alkaloid antagonists mediated opening of a G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channel in the presence of the H297N (Fig Quantitative analysis of this increase in agonist potential at H297N and H297Q receptors

affinities and agonist properties of several opiate alkaloids at these three receptors to test whether H297N and H297Q can truly discriminate between opiate ligands at this level A second and closely related explanation for the general increase in opiate alkaloid agonism at the H297N and H297Q receptors is that the equilibrium between opiate agonist and antagonist binding sites has been shifted to

NK2 and mutant F248S was further evaluated by Ca2 efflux assay (11) Activation of either NK2 or mutant F248S by NKA or GR64349, at 0.11 M concentrations, produced identical acceleration of 45Ca2

Tryptophan residues seemed implicated in the recognition of specific ligand classes, with reduced binding for endogenous peptides at W173A mutant (up to 40-fold) and for nonselective alkaloids at W274A mutant (up to 65-fold) Noticeably, TIPP binding was enhanced at W274A receptor by 5-fold For saturation experiments, eight concentrations of [3H]diprenorphine ranging from 0.05 to 10 nM (for WT, Y129F, W173A, F218A, Y308F) and eight concentrations of [3H]naltrindole ranging from 0.1 to 12 nM (for WT, Y129A, F222A, W274A) were used Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 2 M (for

alanine (W173A, F218A, F222A, and W274A), thus removing the side chains which seem to constitute the aromatic pocket proposed by the model For three mutant receptors (Y129A, F222A, and W274A) [3H]diprenorphine binding appeared weak Expression levels of Y129F, Y129A, F218A, and Y308F mutants are not significantly modified, Bmax values at W173A and W274A mutants are slightly decreased (by

9920910	After conversion of TM3 sites Thr-91 to Ala-91, and Gln-92 to Ala-92, the affinity for N6-substituted agonists was reduced, and binding of ligands without N6 substituents was eliminated Next, we tested the roles of Val-87, Leu-88, Thr-91 in TM3 by converting these sites to alanine residues. Following conversion of Pro-86 to Phe-86, the affinity for N6-substituted agonists was lost, and the affinity for ligands without N6 substitution was reduced However, after conversion of Pro-86 to Phe-86, the binding of N6-substituted ligands (CPA, R-PIA) to the mutant construct was reduced more than 10-fold (Table II) Following conversion of Val-87 to Ala-87, no changes in ligand binding characteristics were seen (Table III) Therefore, we examined the role of carboxamine sites within TMs 1-4 (Asn-70, Gln-92). These amino acids contain oxygen and nitrogen atoms that may form hydrogen bonds with similar atoms in adenosine. Ala-70 and Ala-92 constructs were thus generated and tested. In contrast, when the WTA1AR and the Gly-14 3 Thr-14 constructs were compared, markedly increased affinity for agonists was seen for the mutant receptor, and when the Pro-25 3 Leu-25 construct was examined, the affinity for agonists fell (Tables 1 and 2) In contrast, when the WTA1AR and the Gly-14 3 Thr-14 constructs were compared, markedly increased affinity for agonists was seen for the mutant receptor, and when the Pro-25 3 Leu-25 construct was examined, the affinity for agonists fell (Tables 1 and 2) First, we performed additional A1/ A2AAR transposition studies at sites in TM3 (Pro-86 3 Phe-86, Leu-96 3 Phe-96) After conversion of TM3 sites Thr-91 to Ala-91, and Gln-92 to Ala-92, the affinity for N6-substituted agonists was reduced, and binding of ligands without N6 substituents was eliminated

7559596	(23) demonstrated that ARK1-K220W could inhibit both the phosphorylation and sequestration of the m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtype, but this was dependent upon the level of endogenously expressed kinase In addition, both sequestration and phosphorylation of the wild-type 2AR could be attenuated by overexpressing a dominant-negative mutant of ARK1 (C20 ARK1K220M) A point mutation in bovine ARK1 (K220M) was generated by polymerase chain reaction using a 5 primer encompassing an AccI (position 614) 5 of the lysine to be mutated An MscI-RsrII cassette in pcDNA1/Amp C20 ARK1 was replaced with the same cassette isolated from the pBC construct to create C20 ARK1K220M in pcDNA1/Amp For these experiments, geranylgeranylated (C20 isoprenylated) versions of ARK1 or ARK1-K220M (C20 ARK1) in pcDNA1/Amp were used A kinase mutant with a methionine residue substituted for lysine 220 in the catalytic domain of C20 ARK1 (C20 ARK1K220M) was overexpressed using a pcDNA1/Amp expression vector (Fig 7 is a dose-response curve for agonistpromoted wild-type 2AR sequestration in either the presence or absence of 1 g of cotransfected C20 ARK1-K220M cDNA Rescue of Sequestration by ARK 24786 Overexpression of C20 ARK1-K220M significantly reduced the maximal response for sequestration, 25 5.8% (p 0.05) The EC50 values in the presence and absence of C20 ARK1-K220M were 11 2.9 nM and 12 1.7 nM, respectively Under similar conditions, 2AR-Y326A mutant sequestration was unaffected by C20 ARK1-K220M, which is presumably consistent with the inability of C20 ARK1-K220M to rescue phosphorylation of the mutant receptor (data not shown) The effect of C20 ARK1-K220M overexpression on the phosphorylation of wild-type 2AR and 2AR-Y326A mutant 293 cells were transfected with 0, 1, or 2.5 g of pcDNA1/Amp C20 ARK1K220M cDNA along with pcDNA1/Amp cDNA coding for wild-type 2AR (1409 104 fmol/mg of whole cell protein) or 2AR-Y326A (994 164 fmol/mg of whole cell protein) and assayed for whole cell phosphorylation as described under "Experimental Procedures." A, immunoblot of the overexpression of C20 ARK1-K220M protein with increasing amounts of transfected cDNA Two major molecular weight species were also detected with ARK1/2 antibody, when C20 ARK1-K220M was overexpressed using the pcDNA1/Amp expression vector (see Fig B, autoradiograph showing a representative whole cell phosphorylation of wild-type 2AR following coexpression with increasing amounts of C20 ARK1-K220M incubated for 15 min in the absence ( ) or presence ( ) of 10 M ISO The basal phosphorylation of either receptor was unaffected by the coexpression of increasing amounts of C20 ARK1-K220M The dominant-negative ARK1-K220M, while able to inhibit both the phosphorylation and sequestration of 2AR to equivalent extents in 293 cells, was not overwhelmingly effective at inhibiting either process, 31 11% and 25 6%, respectively However, a modest effect of ARK1-K220M on the sequestration of the wild-type 2AR might be expected, since complete FIG Dose response for the inhibition of wild-type 2AR sequestration by C20 ARK1-K220M 293 cells were transfected with pcDNA1/Amp cDNA either coding wild-type 2AR with (1435 319 fmol/mg of whole cell protein) or without (1345 150 fmol/mg of whole cell protein) 1 g of pcDNA1/Amp C20 ARK1-K220M cDNA and assayed for agonist-promoted sequestration as described under "Experimental Procedures" except that sequestration was measured following 30-min stimulation with 10 10 to 10 5 M ISO The basal sequestration of the 2AR in these experiments in the presence or absence C20 ARK1-K220M cDNA was 33 1.2% and 30 0.8%, respectively The R values for the curve fits in the presence and absence of C20 ARK1-K220M were 0.96 and 0.98, respectively In the present study, a similar result was obtained for C20 ARK1-K220M, which attenuated both whole cell phosphorylation and sequestration of the 2AR Mutation of tyrosine residue 326 to an alanine resulted in a 2AR mutant ( 2AR-Y326A) that was defective in its ability to sequester and was less well coupled to adenylyl cyclase than the wild-type 2AR When expressed in 293 cells, the maximal response for phosphorylation of the 2AR-Y326A mutant was impaired by 75% Further characterization of this phosphorylation, using either forskolin stimulation or phosphorylation site-deficient 2AR-Y326A mutants, demonstrated that the 2AR-Y326A mutant can be phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) but does not serve as a substrate for the -adrenergic receptor kinase 1 ( ARK1) However, overexpression of ARK1 led to the agonist-dependent phosphorylation of the 2AR-Y326A mutant and rescue of its sequestration ARK1-mediated rescue of 2AR-Y326A sequestration could be prevented by mutating putative ARK phosphorylation sites, but not PKA phosphorylation sites 24782 ( 2AR-Y326A) (15) The 2AR-Y326A mutant, while unable to sequester, could desensitize, down-regulate, and be phosphorylated in response to agonist and, although its coupling was impaired, was able to maximally stimulate adenylyl cyclase in membranes (15) This suggested that the 2AR-Y326A mutant might provide an excellent tool for directly testing if agonist-promoted receptor sequestration played a role in receptor dephosphorylation However, further examination of the ability of the 2AR-Y326A mutant to be phosphorylated revealed that the 2AR-Y326A mutant could not be used to study receptor dephosphorylation since, while it was a substrate for PKA phosphorylation, it did not serve as a substrate for phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinases Interestingly though, we have used the 2AR-Y326A mutant in conjunction with ARK1 overexpression, as well as a dominant-negative ARK1, to demonstrate that ARK phosphorylation can facilitate 2AR sequestration (3) and the 12CA5 epitope-tagged 2AR and 2ARY326A in pBC (15) were used as templates for construction of PKA and ARK phosphorylation site-deficient 2AR-Y326A mutants The first mutated PKA site in the third intracellular loop of the PKA site-deficient 2AR was excised with NcoI-HpaI and used to replace the identical cassette of the 12CA5 epitope tagged 2AR-Y326A cloned into pBC The second mutated PKA site was created by replacing the NcoI-FspI cassette of the PKA phosphorylation site-deficient 2AR in pBC with the identical cassette from 2AR-Y326A containing the first mutated PKA site A ARK phosphorylation site-deficient 12CA5 epitope-tagged 2ARY326A mutant in pBC was obtained by replacing the StuI-AccI cassette containing all the potential ARK phosphorylation sites with the same cassette from the ARK site-deficient 2AR in pBC RESULTS Comparison of Wild-type 2AR and 2AR-Y326A Mutant Phosphorylation--Initial experiments tested the time course for the whole cell phosphorylation of wild-type 2AR and 2ARY326A expressed at similar levels in 293 cells, in response to 10 M ISO stimulation (Fig This resulted in a maximum increase in phosphorylation of 5.2 1.0-fold over basal for the 2AR, but only 2.6 0.7-fold over basal for the 2AR-Y326A mutant (a similar result was obtained for permanently transfected CHO cells, data not shown) Maximal phosphorylation of each receptor was observed within 35 min of agonist stimulation (t1/2 41 14 s for the 2AR versus 76 13 for the 2AR-Y326A, p 0.05) Although the wild-type 2AR and 2AR-Y326A mutant phosphorylate at somewhat different rates, this could not account for the large differences in the extent of phosphorylation observed for these two receptors Therefore, the 2AR-Y326A mutant was tested for its ability to be phosphorylated by these two types of kinases First, wild-type 2ARs and 2AR-Y326A mutants, expressed in 293 cells, were challenged for 15 min with either 10 M ISO or 25 M forskolin (in the presence of 1 mM IBMX) to stimulate adenylyl cyclase and raise intracellular cAMP levels in the presence or absence of receptor activation, respectively Under these conditions, the magnitude of agonist- and forskolin-induced phosphorylation of the 2Y326A mutant was identical (26 5.7% and 23 7.6% of wild-type 2AR phosphorylation, respectively) Second, wild-type 2AR and 2AR-Y326A mutants were prepared in which their putative sites of PKA and ARK phosphorylation were removed Comparison of the whole cell phosphorylation of wildtype 2ARs and 2AR-Y326A mutants 293 cells were transfected with pcDNA1/Amp cDNA encoding 2AR and 2AR-Y326A and assayed for whole cell phosphorylation as described under "Experimental Procedures." A, time course for the phosphorylation of wild-type 2AR (725 261 fmol/mg of whole cell protein) and 2AR-Y326A mutant (646 175 fmol/mg of whole cell protein) in response to stimulation with 10 M ISO (15 s to 20 min) The R values for the curve fits for 2AR and 2AR-Y326A mutant phosphorylation time courses were 0.97 and 0.98, respectively B, the comparison of agonist-induced (10 M ISO) phosphorylation with forskolin (FSK)-mediated (25 M in the presence of 1 mM IBMX) phosphorylation of the wild-type 2AR (772 457 fmol/mg of whole cell protein) and 2AR-Y326A mutants (763 385 fmol/mg of whole cell protein) Basal phosphorylation (agonist-independent phosphorylation) of the 2AR and 2AR-Y326A mutant in A and B was identical as quantitated using the Molecular Dynamics phosphorimaging system Rescue of Sequestration by ARK 24784 ARK phosphorylation sites in either the wild-type 2AR or 2AR-Y326A did not prevent the mobilization of an adenylyl cyclase response by any of the phosphorylation site-deficient mutants (Ref However, the 2AR-Y326A served solely as a PKA substrate, as the level of its phosphorylation was unchanged by the removal of ARK phosphorylation sites (20 7.5% versus 17 2.3%) 2AR-Y326A mutant phosphorylation was essentially inhibited upon the removal of its PKA phosphorylation sites (Fig Rescue of 2AR-Y326A Mutant Phosphorylation and Sequestration--It was clear that the 2AR-Y326A mutant, under the experimental conditions tested, did not serve as a substrate for phosphorylation at ARK phosphorylation sites and served only as a substrate for PKA in 293 cells However, the possibility existed that the Y326A mutation reduced the effectiveness of the activated mutant receptor as a substrate for ARK phosphorylation Therefore, we tested whether ARK1 overexpression could overcome the presumed impairment as a substrate for ARK phosphorylation of the 2AR-Y326A mutant 3B, ARK1, when overexpressed, rescued the phosphorylation of the 2AR-Y326A mutant, such that the extent of phosphorylation of the mutant receptor was equivalent to wild-type 2AR phosphorylation if both receptors where coexpressed with 10 g of ARK1 cDNA The level of agonist-induced 2AR-Y326A mutant phosphorylation was increased 5-fold from 26.9 2.6% to a maximum of 146 36% of wild-type 2AR phosphorylation (Fig Therefore, the Y326A mutation appears to decrease the effectiveness of 2AR as a substrate for ARK phosphorylation Since the 2AR-Y326A mutant phosphorylation deficit could be reversed by overexpressing ARK1, we reasoned that agonist-promoted sequestration might also be influenced by the overexpression of ARK1 Under control conditions, 42 3.1% of wild-type 2ARs and 5 1.9% of 2AR-Y326A mutants sequestered in response to 10 M ISO stimulation (Fig 3A) produced a progressive rescue of 2AR-Y326A mutant sequestration essentially back to wild-type 2AR levels In addition to 293 cells, the ability of the 2AR-Y326A mutant to sequester was also tested in CHO, CHW, and COS7 cells In each case, the sequestration of the 2AR-Y326A mutant was impaired to an equivalent or greater extent than reported here for its sequestration in 293 cells, indicating that its inability to sequester in response to agonist was not the consequence of the cellular environment in which it was tested (data not shown) Role of Phosphorylation in Sequestration-- ARK1 rescued both the phosphorylation and sequestration of the 2AR-Y326A mutant First, we tested the ability of ARK1 overexpression to rescue the sequestration of phosphorylation site-deficient 2AR-Y326A mutants Phosphorylation of wild-type 2AR and 2AR-Y326A phosphorylation site-deficient mutants 293 cells were transfected with pcDNA1/Amp cDNA encoding wild-type (WT), ARK phosphorylation site-deficient ( ARK-) or PKA phosphorylation site-deficient (PKA-) 2AR and 2AR-Y326A and assayed for whole cell phosphorylation as described under "Experimental Procedures."

The major species of the 2AR expressed in 293 cells is a glycoprotein of a molecular mass ranging from 56 to 85 kDa Effect of the overexpression of ARK1 on 2AR and 2AR-Y326A mutant sequestration 293 cells were transfected with 0, 1, 2.5, or 10 g of ARK1 cDNA in a pcDNA1 expression vector along with pcDNA1/Amp cDNA either coding for wild-type 2AR (967 85 fmol/mg of whole cell protein) or 2AR-Y326A mutant (812 94 fmol/mg of whole cell protein) and assayed for agonist-promoted sequestration as described under "Experimental Procedures." Basal sequestration of both the 2AR and 2AR-Y326A mutant were unaffected by coexpression with increasing amounts of ARK1 Basally sequestered receptors represented 27 4% and 31 2.4% of total cellular 2AR and 2AR-Y326A, respectively, in these experiments p 0.005 ( ) or p 0.0005 ( ) versus control agonist-promoted 2AR-Y326A mutant sequestration Under similar conditions, 2AR-Y326A mutant sequestration was unaffected by C20 ARK1-K220M, which is presumably consistent with the inability of C20 ARK1-K220M to rescue phosphorylation of the mutant receptor (data not shown) First, ARK1, when overexpressed, rescues both the phosphorylation and the sequestration of the 2AR-Y326A mutant which was defective in its ability to be phosphorylated by ARK and to sequester in response to agonist stimulation Second, overexpressed ARK1 can rescue the sequestration of PKA phosphorylation site-deficient, but not ARK phosphorylation site-deficient, 2AR-Y326A mutants The conclusion that ARK1 phosphorylation is involved in 2AR sequestration evolved from experiments testing the role of sequestration in receptor dephosphorylation using the 2ARY326A mutant This result indicated that the 2AR-Y326A mutant could not be used to study receptor dephosphorylation Effect of C20 ARK1 on the sequestration of wild-type 2AR and 2AR-Y326A phosphorylation site-deficient mutants 293 cells were transfected with 1 g of pcDNA1/Amp C20 ARK1 cDNA along with pcDNA1/Amp cDNA encoding one of the following: wild-type (WT), ARK phosphorylation site-deficient ( ARK-), or PKA phosphorylation site-deficient (PKA-) 2AR and 2AR-Y326A and assayed for agonist-promoted sequestration as described under "Experimental Procedures." The basal sequestration of each of the receptors was equivalent and was not affected by coexpression of 1 g of C20 ARK1 cDNA The expression levels for each receptor (fmol/mg of whole cell protein) were as follows 2AR-WT 1102 173, 2AR- ARK 1108 243, 2AR-PKA 1440 252, 2ARY326A-WT 757 112, 2AR-Y326A- ARK 795 161 and 2ARY326A-PKA 951 161 p 0.05 ( ) or p 0.005 ( ) versus agonist-promoted wild-type 2AR-Y326A mutant sequestration The effect of C20 ARK1-K220M overexpression on the phosphorylation of wild-type 2AR and 2AR-Y326A mutant 293 cells were transfected with 0, 1, or 2.5 g of pcDNA1/Amp C20 ARK1K220M cDNA along with pcDNA1/Amp cDNA coding for wild-type 2AR (1409 104 fmol/mg of whole cell protein) or 2AR-Y326A (994 164 fmol/mg of whole cell protein) and assayed for whole cell phosphorylation as described under "Experimental Procedures." A, immunoblot of the overexpression of C20 ARK1-K220M protein with increasing amounts of transfected cDNA Rescue of Sequestration by ARK 24787 Therefore, the desensitization of the 2AR-Y326A mutant previously reported (15) was likely the consequence of PKA- rather than ARK-mediated phosphorylation of the receptor, since both mechanisms have been demonstrated to effectively desensitize the wild-type 2AR (3, 4) We have tested the ability of the 2AR-Y326A mutant to sequester in four different cell lines (CHO, 293, CHW, and COS7) and in each case the mutant was impaired in its ability to sequester This suggests that the inability of this receptor to sequester and be phosphorylated by ARK is likely an intrinsic property of the 2AR-Y326A mutant receptor rather than the consequence of the cell type in which it has been expressed It is likely that the intrinsic properties of the 2AR-Y326A mutant have allowed us to uncover a previously unappreciated role for phosphorylation in the 2AR sequestration process ARK1 phosphorylation of the 2AR-Y326A mutant effectively rescues its complete lack of sequestration, whereas removal of the ARK phosphorylation sites in the wild-type 2AR only reduces sequestration by 50% in 293 cells This indicates that the basis for the sequestration impairment of the 2AR-Y326A mutant goes beyond a simple lack of phosphorylation In fact, a smaller proportion of 2AR-Y326A mutant receptors exhibit high-affinity agonist binding (15) Thus, an impairment in the active conformation of the 2AR-Y326A mutant may explain a lack of phosphorylation by the normal endogenous complement of G protein-coupled receptor kinase in 293 cells, but that overexpression of ARK1 in these cells can overcome this deficit (29) demonstrated that ARK1-K220R did not inhibit 2AR sequestration (29) reported that ARK-K220R, while able to inhibit in vitro 2AR phosphorylation, was impaired in its G targeting and had no effect on sequestration

experiments We confirmed that the antagonists butaclamol, clozapine, epidepride, haloperidol, and spiperone potentiate isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP via D2S and via S197A To verify that the loss of the ability to detect inverse agonism via S193A and S194A was the result of mutation-induced decreases in the constitutive activity of the receptors rather than an effect of the mutations on the inverse agonism of the drugs, we determined that treatment with PTX enhanced isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation in C6-D2S and C6-S197A cells but not in C6-S193A or C6-S194A cells We used rat D2S dopamine receptor mutants, each containing a serine-toalanine substitution (S193A, S194A, S197A), to investigate the mechanism through which these residues affect activation of the receptor Activation of the mutant receptor S194A was abolished in an agonist-dependent manner, such that dopamine no longer inhibited cAMP accumulation in C6 glioma cells or activated G protein-regulated K channels in Xenopus laevis oocytes, whereas the efficacy of several other agonists was unaffected Dihydrexidine did not inhibit cAMP accumulation at either S193A or S194A The decreased efficacy of dihydrexidine at S193A and S194A and dopamine at S194A was associated with a decreased ability to detect a GTP-sensitive high affinity binding state for these agonists The ability of dopamine to

was prevented by prior inactivation of PTXsensitive G proteins (25 ng/ml PTX for 1824 hr, data not shown) Furthermore, inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity by 7-OH-DPAT via S194A was inhibited by dopamine in an apparently competitive manner, as indicated by parallel rightward shifts in the dose-response curve for 7-OH-DPAT in the presence of increasing concentrations of dopamine (Fig The pA2 value for dopamine at S194A, calculated by the Schild analysis (Fig Thus, the potency of dopamine was significantly decreased at S193A compared with that of D2S, and the potency of quinpirole was significantly decreased at S194A compared with that of D2S NPA had decreased potency for inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity via S193A and S194A, although the decreases were not statistically significant due to higher variability in the responses To determine whether activation of signaling pathways in addition to inhibition of adenylate cyclase was altered by mutation of S194, we assessed the ability of D2S and S194A to activate Kir3 potassium channels in X In oocytes expressing S194A and Kir3.1/3.2, in contrast, small responses were observed only at 1 and 3 M dopamine Analysis of the dose -response curve for dopamine at S194A resulted in an EC50 value of 0.2 M, although this value should be interpreted with caution because of the lack of any data points on the rising portion of the curve Oocytes expressing D2S or S194A did not significantly differ in their responses to quinpirole (Fig Inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity by 7-OH-DPAT (1 M) via the S194A mutant receptor is antagonized by dopamine The decrease in affinity was greatest for the high affinity (KH) component of binding, which was completely abolished for DHX at S193A or S194A Effects of each mutation on the affinity of noncatecholamine agonists were lesser and did not reach statistical significance, with the exception of a significant decrease in the low affinity (KL) site for quinpirole at S194A The

or for dopamine binding to S194A in three of seven experiments To confirm the apparent deficit in G protein coupling of S193A and S194A receptors suggested by the decreased affinity of the G protein state for some agonists, we assessed the ability of agonists to modulate G protein activation by quantifying receptor-stimulated binding of [35S]GTP S Dopamine-stimulated [35S]GTP S binding via S194A

S197A, 86 12 pmol/well) Data are from a single experiment representative of four or five independent experiments, each carried out in triplicate, and are expressed as the percentage of isoproterenolstimulated cAMP accumulation in the absence of butaclamol (D2S, 142 pmol/well; S193A, 15 9 pmol/well; S194A, 65 20 pmol/well; S197A, 73 15 pmol/well) No curve is shown for the S193A and S194A mutants because there was no detectable potentiation by butaclamol at these receptors Our prior characterization of mutant D2S receptors, in which each of the serine residues in TM5 was converted to an alanine, demonstrated the unique result that the S194A mutant displays an agonist-dependent loss of inhibition of adenylate cyclase (Cox et al., 1992) Here, we confirmed that dopamine does not inhibit cAMP accumulation via S194A, although the efficacy of several other agonists (NPA, 7-OHDPAT, and quinpirole) at S194A was similar to that of the wild-type D2S receptor The loss of efficacy for inhibition of cAMP accumulation by dopamine via S194A occurred despite only modest changes in the affinity of the mutant for dopamine, determined in radioligand binding assays in the presence of GTP Because an antagonist is a drug with binding affinity but no efficacy (Kenakin, 1996), we determined that dopamine acted as an antagonist at S194A, shifting the dose-response curve for 7-OH-DPAT rightward in an apparently competitive manner In addition to dopamine and para-tyramine (Cox et al., 1992), the current results show that DHX was unable to inhibit cAMP accumulation via S194A The mutation-induced loss of efficacy does not seem to be related to the efficacy of the agonists at the wild-type receptor because both full (dopamine) and partial (para-tyramine) agonists lost efficacy at S194A, whereas other full (quinpirole) and partial (meta-tyramine) agonists retained efficacy at the mutant receptor (current results and Cox et al., 1992) Alterations in signaling by the S194A mutant were not confined to one signaling pathway Here, we used an oocyte expression system to show that the ability of dopamine to activate the Kir3.1/Kir3.2 heteromultimer was dramatically reduced by mutation of Ser194, whereas quinpirole and 7-OH-DPAT were as active at S194A as at the wild-type D2S receptor Thus, the pattern of agonistdependent efficacy via S194A was similar for both G protein and subunit-regulated pathways We observed decreases in the high affinity binding of some agonists to S193A and S194A similar to those observed for TM5 serine mutants in studies of the human and rat D2L dopamine receptors (Mansour et al., 1992; Woodward et al., 1996) The ratio KL/KH, on the other hand, was changed by the serine mutations in an agonist-selective manner, being greatly decreased as a result of larger mutation-induced reductions in high affinity compared with low affinity binding for dopamine at S194A, NPA at S193A and S194A, quinpirole at S193A, and S197A, and 7-OH-DPAT at S194A (Table 3) These results are consistent with the prediction that KL/KH correlates with agonist efficacy (Wreggett and De Lean, 1984; Lahti et al., 1992; Harley et al., 1995) insofar as both the greatest decreases in KL/KH and the loss of efficacy for inhibition of cAMP accumulation were observed for dopamine at S194A and DHX at S193A and S194A Still, it is surprising that substantial reductions in KL/KH were observed, such as the decrease for NPA from a ratio of 1000 at D2S to 100 at S194A, without any detectable effect on the efficacy of the agonist Data are expressed as the percentage of isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation in cells not treated with PTX (C6, 232 48 pmol/well; D2S, 128 11 pmol/well; S193A, 23 6 pmol/well; S194A, 84 14 pmol/well; S197A, 61 21 pmol/well) and are the mean standard error of four to six independent experiments Consistent with the selective loss of efficacy by dopamine at S194A, the ability of dopamine to stimulate the binding of [35S]GTP S was significantly decreased via S194A while maximal stimulation of binding by 7-OH-DPAT and quinpirole was not significantly decreased Although there was a tendency for the binding stimulated by the latter two drugs to be decreased at S194A, the effect of the mutation on the efficacy of dopamine was qualitatively different because the residual dopamine-stimulated binding of [35S]GTP S via S194A was completely insensitive to treatment with PTX Dissociation of subunits from this G protein may contribute to the small dopamine-activated potassium current mediated by S194A In this case, our finding of a selective loss of efficacy for some agonists at S194A, S193A, or both would support the hypothesis that a receptor can assume multiple active conformations and that the chemical structure of the agonist determines which form predominates (Gardner, 1995; Kenakin, 1995, 1996; Krumins and Barber, 1997) None of the antagonists tested potentiated cAMP responses to isoproterenol in C6S193A and C6-S194A cells To verify that the loss of the ability to detect inverse agonism via S193A and S194A was the result of mutation-induced decreases in the constitutive activity of the receptors rather than an effect of the mutations on the inverse agonism of the drugs, we determined that treatment with PTX enhanced isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation in C6-D2S and C6-S197A cells but not in C6-S193A or C6-S194A cells The demonstration that S193A and S194A were not constitutively active supports the hypothesis that the inability of these mutants to respond to certain agonists of the wild-type D2S receptor reflected their decreased ability to adopt an active conformation, in agreement with results of experiments involving the 1A-adrenergic receptor (Hwa and Perez, 1996) EC50S values are expressed as the geometric mean followed by the limits defined by the asymmetrical standard error from at least three independent experiments We used rat D2S dopamine receptor mutants, each containing a serine-toalanine substitution (S193A, S194A, S197A), to investigate the mechanism through which these residues affect activation of the receptor Dihydrexidine did not inhibit cAMP accumulation at either S193A or S194A The decreased efficacy of dihydrexidine at S193A and S194A and dopamine at S194A was associated with a decreased ability to detect a GTP-sensitive high affinity binding state for these agonists ABBREVIATIONS: TM5, fifth-transmembrane domain; 7-OH-DPAT, 7-hydroxy-2-dipropylaminotetralin; GTP S, guanosine-5

D2S, 48 (4354) pM for S193A, 37 (3243) pM for S194A, and 37 (2847) pM for S197A The average density of the receptors was similar (Bmax 1119 195 fmol/mg for D2S, 1654 233 fmol/mg for S193A, 1073 223 fmol/mg for S194A, and 1221 223 fmol/mg for S197A; five or more experiments for each cell line) In agreement with our previous work (Cox et al., 1992), dopamine produced no inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity in cells expressing S194A (C6-S194A), although maximal inhibition in C6-S193A or C6-S197A cells was similar to that for C6-D2S (Table 1) The D1 receptor catecholamine agonist DHX also was an agonist at D2S and S197A receptors but lacked efficacy for inhibition of adenylate cyclase via S193A or S194A Thus, the potency of dopamine was significantly decreased at S193A compared with that of D2S, and the potency of quinpirole was significantly decreased at S194A compared with that of D2S NPA had decreased potency for inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity via S193A and S194A, although the decreases were not statistically significant due to higher variability in the responses The decrease in affinity was greatest for the high affinity (KH) component of binding, which was completely abolished for DHX at S193A or S194A The proportion of sites in the high affinity state for most agonists was not altered (Table 4), except that the high affinity state was not detectable for DHX binding to S193A and S194A in any experiments or for dopamine binding to S194A in three of seven experiments To confirm the apparent deficit in G protein coupling of S193A and S194A receptors suggested by the decreased affinity of the G protein state for some agonists, we assessed the ability of agonists to modulate G protein activation by quantifying receptor-stimulated binding of [35S]GTP S Dopamine-stimulated [35S]GTP S binding via S194A was significantly decreased compared with wild-type, S193A, or S197A receptors (Fig PTX treatment also eliminated dopamine-stimulated

inhibition of cAMP accumulation by S193A and S194A, we measured [35S]GTP S binding in the presence of the inverse agonist butaclamol Basal [35S]GTP S binding in untransfected C6 cells (100 fmol/mg) or in C6-S193A (91 fmol/mg) and C6-S194A (99 fmol/mg) cells was not affected by butaclamol, again indicating a lack of inverse agonism (Fig The data are expressed as the percent increase over binding in

experiments, each carried out in triplicate, and are expressed as the percentage of isoproterenolstimulated cAMP accumulation in the absence of butaclamol (D2S, 142 pmol/well; S193A, 15 9 pmol/well; S194A, 65 20 pmol/well; S197A, 73 15 pmol/well) No curve is shown for the S193A and S194A mutants because there was no detectable potentiation by butaclamol at these receptors We observed decreases in the high affinity binding of some agonists to S193A and S194A similar to those observed for TM5 serine mutants in studies of the human and rat D2L dopamine receptors (Mansour et al., 1992; Woodward et al., 1996) The ratio KL/KH, on the other hand, was changed by the serine mutations in an agonist-selective manner, being greatly decreased as a result of larger mutation-induced reductions in high affinity compared with low affinity binding for dopamine at S194A, NPA at S193A and S194A, quinpirole at S193A, and S197A, and 7-OH-DPAT at S194A (Table 3) These results are consistent with the prediction that KL/KH correlates with agonist efficacy (Wreggett and De Lean, 1984; Lahti et al., 1992; Harley et al., 1995) insofar as both the greatest decreases in KL/KH and the loss of efficacy for inhibition of cAMP accumulation were observed for dopamine at S194A and DHX at S193A and S194A Data are expressed as the percentage of isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation in cells not treated with PTX (C6, 232 48 pmol/well; D2S, 128 11 pmol/well; S193A, 23 6 pmol/well; S194A, 84 14 pmol/well; S197A, 61 21 pmol/well) and are the mean standard error of four to six independent experiments In this case, our finding of a selective loss of efficacy for some agonists at S194A, S193A, or both would support the hypothesis that a receptor can assume multiple active conformations and that the chemical structure of the agonist determines which form predominates (Gardner, 1995; Kenakin, 1995, 1996; Krumins and Barber, 1997) None of the antagonists tested potentiated cAMP responses to isoproterenol in C6S193A and C6-S194A cells To verify that the loss of the ability to detect inverse agonism via S193A and S194A was the result of mutation-induced decreases in the constitutive activity of the receptors rather than an effect of the mutations on the inverse agonism of the drugs, we determined that treatment with PTX enhanced isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation in C6-D2S and C6-S197A cells but not in C6-S193A or C6-S194A cells The demonstration that S193A and S194A were not constitutively active supports the hypothesis that the inability of these mutants to respond to certain agonists of the wild-type D2S receptor reflected their decreased ability to adopt an active conformation, in agreement with results of experiments involving the 1A-adrenergic receptor (Hwa and Perez, 1996)

UV-vis spectra in Inset The UV-vis spectra as well as the CD spectra for P23H-I are shown in Fig The gel pattern obtained on SDS PAGE of P23H-II is shown in Fig The purified fraction of P23H-II showed the absorption spectrum (II) (Fig The CD spectrum shown in the same panel showed about 76% helicity relative to that of P23H-I The correctly folded D190A-I and misfolded opsin D190A-II were separated as above for the P23H proteins 2, the mutant G188R showed a main opsin band at 40 kDa and two lower bands at 33 and 30 kDa, similar to that of the misfolded P23H-II (lane 4) and D190A-II (lane 6) proteins The intensities of the bands were similar to those observed in both the P23H-II and D190A-II opsins 5B shows the behavior of the mutant rhodopsin P23H-I and the mutant opsin P23H-II in response to trypsin P23H-I was susceptible to proteolysis and formed a 30-kDa band as the major product (this result is also repeated below in Fig Further, P23H-II was degraded to a number of smaller fragments under the same conditions Tryptic digestion of wild-type ROS and COS cell rhodopsins and of purified protein fractions from the rhodopsin mutants P23H, D190A, G188R, and Y191-Y192 (B) Purified retinal-binding fraction P23H-I and non-retinal-binding fraction P23H-II Further characterization of the products formed on tryptic degradation of the retinal-binding fraction P23H-I (A) 35S-labeled P23H-I at 0 time and after 3 h of tryptic digestion The sizes of the fragments generated by trypsin digestion are also similar to that of P23H-II Trypsin Degradation of the Mutant Rhodopsin P23H-I In comparison with the wild-type rhodopsin, P23H-I showed higher susceptibility to trypsin (see Fig The mode of degradation of P23H-I by trypsin was examined in further detail Thus, the folding of P23H-I to the rhodopsin-like structure is abnormal relative to the wild-type rhodopsin in that it has a site that is vulnerable to cleavage by trypsin, presumably near the N terminus In this study, we used the same method to separate the proteins expressed from rhodopsin mutants P23H and D190A into pure retinal-binding and non-retinal-binding fractions Thus, the present study has clearly shown that the two ADRP mutations, P23H and G188R, cause partial and total misfolding, respectively However, the retinal-binding fraction from the mutant P23H (P23H-I) also showed a subtle difference in the folding pattern from the wild-type rhodopsin This was indicated by the sensitivity to cleavage by trypsin at the new site in P23H-I that resulted in the formation of the new fragment ( 30 kDa) (Fig Thus, the results indicate that, whereas P23H-I folded to form a correct 11-cis-retinal binding pocket, there was an abnormality in the folding

G121L/M257A, G121L/V258A, and G121L/W265Y) did not display such a rescuing effect (not shown) The dark activities for double mutants E113A/G121L (46.5%), G121L/I219A (34.0%), G121L/M257A (78.9%), G121L/V258A (14.2%), and G121L/W265Y (32.5%) are all greater than their respective opsin activities; furthermore, they are equal to or greater than that of G121L In contrast, the G121L mutant regenerated with 11-cis-retinal displayed an abnormally high level of Gt activation in the dark (Fig Upon illumination, mutant pigment G121L and Rho exhibited identical abilities to catalyze GTP S uptake by Gt (Fig The purified sample of mutant G121L is a mixture of G121L pigment with a visible max value of 475 nm and free G121L opsin as judged by the high spectral ratio (A280/A475) of 8.2 1.1 (14) Since G121L opsin purified in parallel did not activate Gt, the Gt activation shown in Fig 1A originated from G121L pigment rather than from constitutive activity of the G121L opsin This paper is available on line at http://www.jbc.org 23081 that G121L incorporated ATR much faster than the 11-cis isomer (14) To control for these possible artifacts, the G121L mutant opsin was incubated with ATR and then subjected to the same purification procedure These findings argue against the possibility that the dark activity of the G121L pigment is due to the presence of ATR during ligand incorporation We regenerated wild-type opsin as well as mutant opsins G121V and G121L with Ret-7 The pigments Rho-7, G121V-7, and G121L-7 were purified in DM G121L-7 was also very similar to G121L as shown in Fig The max of G121L-7 (470 nm) was slightly blue-shifted from that of G121L (475 nm), and the absorbance at the max is also lowered compared with G121L Purified pigments G121L-7 and G121L were tested in parallel for their ability to activate Gt in the dark (Fig Four independent experiments resulted in a mean of 2.1 0.4 for the ratio of the dark activity of G121L-7 versus that of G121L These results demonstrate that although Ret-7 cannot be converted to ATR either thermally or photochemically, it can still cause purified G121L-7 to activate Gt These results strongly suggest that the 11-cis form of retinal, a strong inverse agonist for wild-type opsin and constitutively active mutants tested, functions as a partial agonist for the G121L mutant Rho mutant G121L catalyzed GTP S uptake by Gt in the dark The mutant pigment G121L was purified after incubation with 11-cis-retinal A, pigment G121L displayed significant ability to activate Gt in darkness B, under continuous illumination, mutant pigment G121L and Rho were nearly identical in catalyzing GTP S uptake by Gt B, UV-visible absorption spectra of mutant pigment G121L and G121L opsin regenerated with the chromophore analogue Ret-7 (G121L-7) G121L and G121L-7 were purified after incubation with 11-cis-retinal and Ret-7, respectively The visible max values of G121L and G121L-7 were 475 nm and 470 nm, respectively Gt activation in the dark by purified pigments G121L and G121L-7 is shown in the inset Likewise, the high level of dark activity of mutant G121L could be reversed by second-site Phe261 mutation (Fig A series of Phe261 second-site mutants was tested for the ability to suppress the high dark activity of G121L Mutants G121L/F261A, G121L/F261T, G121L/F261V, and G121L/F261W were prepared While the F261A mutation completely suppressed the dark activity of G121L, F261W did not show any effect Other double mutants tested (G121L/ I219A, G121L/M257A, G121L/V258A, and G121L/W265Y) did not display such a rescuing effect (not shown) These secondsite mutations failed to rescue other phenotypes of the G121L mutant as well (15) The opsin activity and dark activity of Phe261 single mutants F261A, F261T, F261V, and F261W and their respective G121L double mutants G121L/F261A, G121L/ F261T, G121L/F261V, and G121L/F261W were measured (Table I) The F261A replacement reduced the dark activity of G121L/F261A to 4.4% from 14.6% observed in G121L G121L/F261A displayed significant constitutive activity (9.4%), which could be partially suppressed by the presence of 11-cis-retinal Therefore, 11-cis-retinal acts as an inverse agonist for G121L/F261A mutant opsin (as it does for wild-type opsin), rather than as a partial agonist The double mutant G121L/F261A not only has decreased dark activity compared with G121L, but the second-site mutation reverts the nature of the agonism of the 11-cis-retinal ligand G121L/F261T also displayed significant constitutive activity FIG Light-independent Gt activation by mutant pigment G121L can be suppressed by a second-site mutation at position Phe261 The ability of mutant pigment G121L to catalyze GTP S uptake by Gt in the dark was compared with that of double mutants G121L/F261W, G121L/F261V, G121L/F261T, and G121L/F261A The suppression of the G121L dark activity was progressively lessened as the size of the amino acid side chain at position 261 was increased Although the dark activity of G121L/F261T is similar to that of G121L, the difference between dark and opsin activities is greatly reduced Therefore, the second-site F261T mutation is capable of rescuing the dark activity of G121L, changing 11-cis-retinal from a partial agonist to an antagonist G121L/F261V exhibits a very high level of constitutive activity (47.9%) that can be partially suppressed (27.0% dark activity) by 11-cis-retinal, which functions as an inverse agonist Although the apparent dark activity of G121L/F261V is higher than that of G121L, F261V is still capable of suppressing the G121L dark activity judging by the difference of dark activity minus opsin activity of the double mutant G121L/F261W displays essentially the same dark activity as G121L, which is expected since Phe261 is replaced by a larger residue Several other positions were also tested for their ability to rescue the dark activity of G121L mutants The dark activities for double mutants E113A/G121L (46.5%), G121L/I219A (34.0%), G121L/M257A (78.9%), G121L/V258A (14.2%), and G121L/W265Y (32.5%) are all greater than their respective opsin activities; furthermore, they are equal to or greater than that of G121L The dark activity of G121L opsin in the presence of 11-cis-retinal does not change significantly over a period of up to 4 h (not shown) We have shown previously that the ligand-binding site of G121L mutant opsin is altered such that it incorporates ATR faster than 11-cis-retinal ATR can also directly activate G121L TABLE I Opsin and 11-cis-retinal dark activities in

referred to as CHOdhfr ) They, too, despite an apparent variability, did not change in a significant manner throughout the responsive receptors; the only exception was the H198A mutant, which showed both lower expression and reduced affinity for the antagonist ligands (Table 1) H198A The affinity of NKA for the H198A tachykinin NK2 receptor was then estimated to be decreased by about 143- and 159fold using [3H]SR 48968 and [3H]MEN 11420 as tracers, respectively (Table 2), whereas no binding affinity could be estimated for NKB or SP (Table 2) In the case of the H198A mutant, a significant reduction in the Bmax value accompanied the decrease in affinity for the recognized antagonists From the present data, we have evidence that each one of the H198A, Y266F, F270A, and Y289F mutant receptors maintained high-affinity binding for at least one of the three radioligands used Displacement curves of [3H]SR 48968 binding to CHO cell membranes transfected with wild-type (A), H198A (B), Y266F (C), and F270A (D) hNK2R by GR 159897 (f), MEN 11420 (OE), and SR 48968 (F) On the other hand, SP displayed a weak but sizable binding to the wild-type tachykinin NK2 receptor (Ki 1.8 M against [125I]NKA), which was lost in the H198A mutant (Ki 10 M) With regard to the binding of SR 48968 at the H198A mutant receptor, we found a sizable but limited decrease in affinity (about 16-fold): in this respect, our data differ from those of Huang et al (1995), who reported that the binding of SR 48968 is unaffected by the H198A mutation, and from those of Bhogal et al (1994), who reported that binding of SR 48968 is abrogated by the H198A mutation An interesting further observation is that relative to the ligand-dependent variation of the affinity of GR 159897 for the H198A mutant receptor, the affinity of GR 159897 was about 4-fold higher if measured in competition with [3H]MEN 11420 than with [3H]SR 48968 (Ki 58 and 214 nM, respectively) 
8999963	The R137H V2R mutant receptor that binds vasopressin with wild type-like affinity and does not couple to Gs (Rosenthal, W., Antaramian, A., Gilbert, S., and Birnbaumer, M Additionally, we provide evidence that the uncoupled R137H mutant V2R occupied by AVP undergoes a conformational change that leads to receptor recognition by GRK and the sequestration apparatus, but it is not sufficient to activate Gs The R137H mutant V2R, previously characterized by Rosenthal et al As previously reported, the R137H V2R is expressed at a lower level than the wild type receptor, 0.7 compared to 6.0 106 sites/cell in our latest experiments Quantification of ligand-dependent phosphorylation with the PhosphorImager detected 7.5 0.4% phosphorylation in the R137H mutant compared to 100% for the wild type V2R As illustrated, it was evident that that the R137H V2R was phosphorylated in an AVP-dependent manner Agonist effect on V2RQ and V2RQ-R137H receptor phosphorylation The usual volume of extract containing the V2R R137H samples, 20 l, was loaded along 2 l of extract containing wild type receptor 3 and analyzed along the R137H and the wild type V2R 11, the R137H V2R mutant expressed in stably transfected L cells can be sequestered in 10-min exposure to 100 nM AVP to a similar extent as the wild type receptor Agonist effect on V2RQ and V2RQ-R137H receptor sequestration Stably transfected L cells expressing the wild type V2R (wt) or the V2R-R137H (Q23) were treated for 10 min at 37 C with vehicle or 100 nM AVP Agonist effect on V2RQ, V2RQ358t, and V2RQ-R137H receptor phosphorylation The observation that the uncoupled R137H mutant V2R is phosphorylated in response to agonist, indicates that it is possible to dissociate G protein activation from GRK activation as different functions of an activated receptor (27) Despite its functional flaws, the R137H V2R is recognized by the sequestration apparatus with only a small reduction in efficiency, and it can recycle to the cell surface after removal of the ligand in a manner similar to the wild type receptor The phosphorylation in the absence of ligand detected for the R137H V2R is probably a unique property of the mutant receptor Construction of Mutant V2 Receptors--The N22Q mutation and the premature stop codons were introduced into the V2R using a polymerase chain reaction-based approach (13) 
10964911	Mutation of Ser-203 to Ala, Val, or Cys reduced the binding affinity and adenylyl cyclase-activating potency of agonists containing a meta-OH, whereas their affinities and potencies were largely preserved by mutation of Ser-203 to Thr, which maintained an OH at this position Reactions with Methanethiosulfonate (MTS) Reagents--The experiments for the reaction of methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium (MTSEA) with the WT 2AR and the S203C mutant as well as the experiments for the protection of this reaction by isoproterenol were performed as described previously (20) The Ser at position 2035.42 was mutated to Ala (S203A), Val (S203V), Thr (S203T), or Cys (S203C); the Ser at position 2045.43 was mutated to Ala (S204A) Indeed, removal of the OH at position 203 (S203V, S203C, S203A) increased the affinity of propranolol 2-, 5-, and 11-fold, respectively MTSEA, however, potently inhibited [3H]CGP-12177 binding to the S203C mutant (Fig Isoproterenol (1 M ), a catecholamine with a structure similar to that of epinephrine but with a propyl moiety instead of a methyl attached to the protonated amine, substantially retarded the reaction of MTSEA with the S203C mutant (data not shown), suggesting that the residue is on the surface of the binding-site crevice and is sterically protected by bound agonist In contrast, the addition of the mOH did not increase intrinsic

increase of the affinity of the S203A, S203V, and S203C mutants for propranolol, suggesting that the drug binds better when the side chain at position 2035.42 is hydrophobic and/or favorable for interaction with the aromatic ring structure of propranolol The Ser at position 2035.42 was mutated to Ala (S203A), Val (S203V), Thr (S203T), or Cys (S203C); the Ser at position 2045.43 was mutated to Ala (S204A) In three other mutants, two of Ser2035.42, Ser-2045.43, and Ser-2075.46 were simultaneously mutated to Ala (S204A/S207A, S203A/S204A, S203A/S207A) to create a series of constructs in which each Ser was the only residue in this region capable of H-bonding to a catechol hydroxyl The affinity of S204A for epinephrine was decreased 34-fold relative to WT If removal of the OH side chain at the Ser-204 position eliminated interaction with the mOH, we would have expected that removal of the mOH from epinephrine (synephrine) would not lower its affinity for S204A Moreover the affinity of HAL-mOH was higher than that of HAL in S204A, also consistent with a preserved interaction of the mOH Thus the affinity of epinephrine for S203A/ S204A was similar to that of HAL for WT Moreover, removal of the mOH from epinephrine (synephrine) did not further decrease its affinity for S203A/S204A, consistent with the absence of a H bond with the mOH For S204A, S203A/S204A, and S203A/S207A, the Kd values (pM) for [3H]CGP-12177 binding were 189 10, 562 112, and 237 48, respectively This synergism was preserved as well in S204A The addition of the mOH alone (phenylephrine) produced an increase in intrinsic activity relative to HAL in the constructs that contain a hydroxyl at position 2035.42, WT, S203T, S204A, and S204A/S207A (Fig In contrast, the addition of the mOH did not

than HAL-pOH, demonstrating a persistent role of the mOH even in the absence of Ser-2045.43 Based on the results of mutation of Ser2035.42 described above, we infer that the persistent effect of the mOH in S204A comes from an interaction with Ser-2035.42 Whereas in S203A/S204A and in S203A/S207A, HAL-mOH was no better than HAL at activating, in S204A/S207A HALmOH was better able to activate the receptor than was HAL, consistent with a crucial role for an interaction of the mOH with Ser-2035.42 in activation Thus, although the effect of the presence of the mOH alone on potency and maximal activation was essentially abolished by mutation of Ser-2045.43 to Ala, consistent with the conclusion of an interaction between the mOH and Ser-2045.43, the effect of the simultaneous addition of the mOH (which was ineffective alone) and the pOH (which was also ineffective alone) was substantial in S204A In three other mutants, two of Ser2035.42, Ser-2045.43, and Ser-2075.46 were simultaneously mutated to Ala (S204A/S207A, S203A/S204A, S203A/S207A) to create a series of constructs in which each Ser was the only residue in this region capable of H-bonding to a catechol hydroxyl For S204A,

the affinities (Ki) of HAL-mOHpOH before (epinephrine (EPI)) and after removal (DRUG) of one or both OHs from its aromatic ring to 2AR before (WT) and after the mutation of Ser-2035.42 to Thr, Ala, Val, or Cys (S203X) For example, Ki(EPI/WT) and Ki(EPI/S203X) represent the affinities of EPI for the WT and for the S203X mutant, respectively, whereas Ki(DRUG/ WT) and Ki(DRUG/S203X) represent the affinities of EPI after removal of either the mOH, the pOH, or both for the WT and for the S203X mutant, respectively X1 Ki(EPI/WT)/Ki(DRUG/WT), X2 Ki(EPI/ S203X)/Ki(DRUG/S203X), Y1 Ki(DRUG/WT)/Ki(DRUG/S203X), Y2 Ki(EPI/WT)/Ki(EPI/S203X) The affinity change from the EPI/WT interaction to DRUG/S203X interaction must be the same regardless of the pathway followed The factor, X1/X2 Y2/Y1 [ Ki(EPI/WT)/Ki(DRUG/WT) ]/[ Ki(EPI/S203X)/Ki(DRUG/ S203X) ], the coupling coefficient, reflects the extent of interaction between the residue at position 2035.42 and the catechol OHs (for details see "Results") B, three-dimensional plot of 1/ values, calculated according to the above equation, for the pairs of S203X mutants (X is Thr, Ala, Val, or Cys) with epinephrine before and after the removal of mOH (SYN, synephrine), pOH (PHE, phenylephrine), or both ring OHs (HALO, halostachine) 
9694886	For two receptors with two mutations each (T888V/ S895A and T888V/S915A) and one with three mutations (T888V/S895A/ S915A), CJ236 cells were separately transformed with a mutated cassette 6 carrying a single mutation (S895A or T888V) or two mutations (T888V/S915A) the three mutations in the tail (T888V, S895A, and S915A), substantially reduced the EC50[Ca2 o] of the CaR, as shown in Fig Of the three mutations in the tail, T888V had the greatest impact on the function of the receptor, reducing the EC50[Ca2 o] from 4.0 0.1 mM (n 32) to 2.9 0.1 mM (n 5) (p 0.05) Moreover, receptors with two mutations that included T888V (T888V/S895A and T888V/ S915A) had EC50[Ca2 o] values similar to that of the T888V mutant alone The receptor with three mutated PKC sites, T888V/S895A/S915A, was slightly more sensitive to Ca2 o than that with the single mutation, T888V In sharp contrast, PMA produced only small increases in the EC50[Ca2 o] values of all of the mutant receptors containing T888V The receptor with T888V alone showed some decrease in its Ca2 i responses at 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 mM Ca2 o (data not shown) Receptors with one more mutation in addition to Thr888, such as T888V/S895A and T888V/S915A, did not show any alterations in the pattern of the Ca2 i responses observed with the mutant receptor with T888V alone (data not shown) However, receptors with two or more additional mutations, such as the triply mutated (T888V/S895A/S915A) and quintuply mutated CaRs, exhibited markedly reduced inhibitory effects of PMA, only showing some decrease in the Ca2 i response at 1.5 mM Ca2 o (data not shown) The receptors with the most critical PKC site mutated, T888V, which showed the smallest increases in their EC50[Ca2 o] values upon treatment with PMA, were least affected by treatment with staurosporine In summary, the presence of the T888V mutation abolished most of modulatory effects of PKC on the function of the CaR Mutation EC50 [Ca2 ]o Control PMAa

10648631	The R413E mutant displayed a small, but significant increase in basal phosphorylation despite being severely impaired in receptor-mediated response The minimized coordinates of the wild-type 1b-AR and of the A293E constitutively active mutant were then used as starting points for 1050 ps of MD runs Because the first 100 ps were representative of the 1-ns period of simulation for both the wild-type 1b-AR and the A293E constitutively active mutant, for all the other mutants considered in this work, MD runs were reduced to 150 ps, using the same heating and equilibration setup as that employed for the longer simulations To further challenge the role of R143 in receptor activation, we introduced the mutation of R143 to alanine into either the D142A or the A293E constitutively active receptor The constitutive activity of the receptor double mutants D142A/R143A and A293E/R143A was dramatically reduced compared with that of the D142A and A293E receptors In addition, the epinephrine-induced IP response mediated by the D142A/R143A and A293E/R143A mutants was profoundly reduced compared with that of the wild-type 1b-AR (Table 1) Receptor [125I]HEAT binding IP

recently shown that two constitutively active mutants of the 1b-AR displayed opposing phosphorylation features (basal phosphorylation was enhanced for the A293E, but not for the D142A mutant) (Mhaouty-Kodja et al., 1999) Following the same computational approach as reported previously (Scheer et al., 1996; Scheer et al., 1997; Fanelli et al., 1999b), the trajectories of the receptor mutants were compared with those of the wild-type 1b-AR on the one hand and with those of the constitutively active mutants D142A and A293E on the other In the constitutively active mutants D142A and A293E, the motions of the helices, although triggered differently, induce the breakage of the D91-R143 interaction 3, substitution of R143 with lysine produces an average arrangement that shares some structural similarities with the constitutively active mutants A293E and D142A (i.e., the cytosolic exposure of R288 and K291) as well as the configuration of the cytosolic crevice formed by the i2 loop, the cytosolic extension of helices 5 and 6, and the stretch of amino acids 242 to 259 in the middle of the i3 loop (Fig In fact, the shorter amino acid side chain that results from mutation of the arginine to lysine does not favor the interaction of this residue with D91 (helix 2), thus mimicking the breakage of the D91-R143 interaction observed in the A293E and D142A mutants This interaction pattern results in the opening of a site in the cytosolic domains that is similar to that found in the structures of the constitutively active mutants D142A and A293E In accordance with the experimental findings (Table 1), the computer-simulated structures of the mutants D142A/R143A or A293E/R143A displayed none of the structural/dynamic "hallmarks" of either of the constitutively active mutants, D142A or A293E (results not shown) The four panels display the results of MD simulations carried on the wild-type 1b-AR (ground state), the constitutively active mutants A293E and R143K, and the activation-deficient mutant R143E Comparison of the Constitutively Active Receptors R143K and A293E with the Inactive Mutant R143E To better understand the nature of the increased affinity for agonist binding of the activation-defective R143 mutants, we compared the ligand-binding properties of the inactive receptor R143E with those of the two constitutively active mutants, R143K and A293E First, we assessed the intrinsic activities of seven structurally different agonists; second, we measured the binding affinity of the various agonists at the wild-type 1b-AR, R143E, R143K, and A293E receptors The two constitutively active mutations, A293E and R143K, produced similar affinity shifts for all the agonists tested, whereas the shifts induced by R143E were much greater The affinity of epinephrine for the wild-type as well as for the three receptor mutants (A293E, R143K, and R143E) was not influenced by Fig Relationship between the intrinsic activity and the affinity

the affinity shifts caused by the mutations R143E, R143K, and A293E for the seven different agonists were plotted as a function of the agonist intrinsic activities measured at wildtype receptor (Fig The increase in isomerization constant is similar for the constitutively active mutants A293E and R143K, but it seems to be much greater for the activation-deficient mutant R143E Therefore, compared with the constitutively active mutants R143K and A293E, the inactive mutant R143E exhibits a similar pattern but with a much greater efficacy-related shift in binding affinity Thus, an alternative explanation is that the R143E mutation enhances J to a much greater extent than R143K and A293E mutations, but unlike those constitutive activating mutations, it also produces a dramatic reduction of the constant First, the inactivating mutation of R143 to alanine severely impaired both the constitutive and agonist-induced activity of the A293E and D142A mutants (Table 1) Similar findings were also obtained for the previously described constitutively active mutant A293E (Fig The relationship between the affinity shift and the intrinsic activity of the ligands observed for the A293E, R143K, and R143E mutants suggests that the isomerization equilibrium constant of the receptor (J), starting from a very small pre-existing value of the wild-type receptor, is progressively increased for the different mutants [i.e., wild-type 1b-AR A293E R143K R143E (Fig For A293E and R143K, the increase of the J value is consistent with the fact that these mutants are constitutively active [i.e., the isomerization equilibrium is displaced toward the active (R*) states] However, only in the R143K, R143H, and R143D mutants, which display various levels of constitutive activity, does the arrangement and the orientation of the cytosolic loops form structures that are similar to those described previously for the "active" forms of the receptor (compare R143K and A293E in Fig On the other hand, in the activation-deficient mutants, the arrangement of the cytosolic loops is different than that of the active receptors, A293E and R143K (Fig Receptor [125I]HEAT binding IP accumulation Receptor

complete loss of activity (Table 1 and Fig In contrast to R143K and R143H receptors, neither R143A, R143N, R143I, nor R143E displayed any constitutive activity Thus, to further characterize the properties of the 1b-AR mutants carrying mutations of R143, we measured the phosphorylation of the R143A, R143E, and R143K receptors in intact cells For both the activation-defective mutants R143A and R143E, epinephrine did not significantly increase receptor phosphorylation above the basal level However, basal phosphorylation was 40% greater than that of the wild-type receptor for the R143E, but not for the R143A mutant The fact that both the R143A and R143E mutants were impaired in their ability to undergo agonist-induced phosphorylation seems to rule out the possibility that enhanced phosphorylation and desensitization is the mechanism underlying decreased receptor-mediated response for mutations of R143 Indeed, these findings suggest that the R143E might represent a receptor conformation, which favors its phosphorylation in the absence of the agonist, despite the impairment in its signaling response Here we report that the activation-deficient R143E mutant displays increased basal phosphorylation in a manner similar to that observed for some uncoupled mutants of rhodospin (Shi et al., 1998) and V2 receptor (Innamorati et al., 1997) COS-7 cells were transfected with the cDNA encoding the wild-type 1b-AR (WT) or its mutants R143K, R143H, R143D, R143A, R143N, R143I, and R143E A striking feature of all the activation-deficient mutants (R143E, R143A, R143I, and R143N) is their failure to permit the translocation of positively charged amino acids of the i3 loop (i.e., R288, K291) toward the cytosol In the case of R143E shown in Fig However, two main features predict that the R143E mutant is inactive: 1) K291 is buried because of its interaction with E143 and 2) the conformation of the i3 loop is such that the stretch of amino acids 242 to 259 is arranged differently than that of the active receptor forms and might therefore not create a good electrostatic and shape complementarity with the G protein COS-7 cells were transfected with the cDNA encoding the wild-type 1b-AR (WT) or its mutants R143A, R143E, and R143K The four panels display the results of MD simulations carried on the wild-type 1b-AR (ground state), the constitutively active mutants A293E and R143K, and the activation-deficient mutant R143E Surprisingly, the inactive mutants R143E and R143I exhibited the highest affinity for agonists in this series of receptor mutants In particular, the affinity of the R143E mutant for epinephrine was 250-fold higher than that of the wild-type 1b-AR and even 10-fold higher than that of the constitutively active receptor R143K Comparison of the Constitutively Active Receptors R143K and A293E with the Inactive Mutant R143E To better understand the nature of the increased affinity for agonist binding of the

caused by the mutations R143E, R143K, and A293E for the seven different agonists were plotted as a function of the agonist intrinsic activities measured at wildtype receptor (Fig The increase in isomerization constant is similar for the constitutively active mutants A293E and R143K, but it seems to be much greater for the activation-deficient mutant R143E Therefore, compared with the constitutively active mutants R143K and A293E, the inactive mutant R143E exhibits a similar pattern but with a much greater efficacy-related shift in binding affinity This means that R143E, although unable to activate the G protein, seems to have an isomerization equilibrium that is displaced toward the active form R* to an even greater extent than constitutively active receptors themselves In terms of the parameters of the allosteric model (see Appendix), this implies that the R143E mutation enhances J but concurrently reduces the binding affinity M to the point that no receptor-mediated signaling can occur 2 and 4 in the Appendix), this hypothesis could not explain the very large shift in agonist binding affinity observed for the R143E mutant Thus, an alternative explanation is that the R143E mutation enhances J to a much greater extent than R143K and A293E mutations, but unlike those constitutive activating mutations, it also produces a dramatic reduction of the constant From a structural point of view, it is equivalent to state that R143E may be converted into a state that fully matches the high-affinity agonist binding conformation and also binds to the G protein, but in which the network of interactions that transmit conformational perturbation through the G protein interface is disrupted Finally, the fact that the R143A and R143E mutants were unable to undergo agonist-induced phosphorylation seems to exclude enhanced phosphorylation and desensitization as the main mechanism underlying the decrease in the receptor-mediated response for the mutants carrying neutral or negative amino acids at position 143 In particular, for both the constitutively active R143K and the activation-deficient R143E mutants, the affinity shift was 226 Scheer et al The relationship between the affinity shift and the intrinsic activity of the ligands observed for the A293E, R143K, and R143E mutants suggests that the isomerization equilibrium constant of the receptor (J), starting from a very small pre-existing value of the wild-type receptor, is progressively increased for the different mutants [i.e., wild-type 1b-AR A293E R143K R143E (Fig However, the apparent large increase of J for the R143E mutant is in patent conflict with the lack of activity of this receptor (Fig As pointed out under Results, a concurrent reduction of the receptor affinity for the G protein (M) caused by the mutation could explain the loss of signaling, but it was not consistent with the large enhancement of agonist binding affinity observed for the R143E mutant In the context of the "cubic ternary complex model" (Weiss et al., 1996a), the behavior of the R143E mutant can be explained by the fact that mutation of R143 to glutamic acid enhances J but also dramatically reduces the constant , which represents the effect of the G protein on the J constant We may speculate that the R143E isomerizes to a state that favors high affinity for agonists but is unable to either bind the G protein or induce its activation Based on the structural features of R143E, we speculate that this mutant might represent an "active-like" state of the receptor (i.e., a conformational state that might interact with the G protein but is unable to mediate the activation of the G protein) The fact that the agonist affinity shift for the R143E mutant was greater than for all the other mutated receptors suggests that mutation of R143 to glutamic acid results in the highest degree of isomerization of the 1b-AR Interestingly, the R143E displayed a small but significant increase in basal phosphorylation, that was not observed for the other Fig Thus, R143E might represent a substrate for GPCR kinases and/or other regulatory proteins in the absence of agonist, despite being impaired in the receptor-mediated response However, the results of thermodynamic analysis and of MD simulations of the receptor mutants could provide some hypothesis suggesting that R143 in the 1b-AR plays a role in receptor isomerization toward different states, which are best represented by the mutants R143K and R143E The other mutants of R143 share features of both the R143K and R143E receptors These findings seem to support the hypothesis of our MD simulations on the 1b-AR mutants showing that the conformational state of R143E might interact with the G protein but is unable to mediate the activation of the G protein We may conclude from this analysis that an increase of J with a parallel decrease of explains the difference in properties between the defective R143E mutant and the constitutively active mutants compared in this study Other substitutions of R143 resulted in receptor mutants with either a small increase in constitutive activity (R143H and R143D), impairment (R143H, R143D), or complete loss of receptor-mediated response (R143E, R143A, R143N, R143I) Receptor [125I]HEAT binding IP accumulation Receptor expression (pmol/mg of protein) pKi Rmax (% above

the A293E, but not for the D142A mutant) (Mhaouty-Kodja et al., 1999) Following the same computational approach as reported previously (Scheer et al., 1996; Scheer et al., 1997; Fanelli et al., 1999b), the trajectories of the receptor mutants were compared with those of the wild-type 1b-AR on the one hand and with those of the constitutively active mutants D142A and A293E on the other In the constitutively active mutants D142A and A293E, the motions of the helices, although triggered differently, induce the breakage of the D91-R143 interaction 3, substitution of R143 with lysine produces an average arrangement that shares some structural similarities with the constitutively active mutants A293E and D142A (i.e., the cytosolic exposure of R288 and K291) as well as the configuration of the cytosolic crevice formed by the i2 loop, the cytosolic extension of helices 5 and 6, and the stretch of amino acids 242 to 259 in the middle of the i3 loop (Fig In fact, the shorter amino acid side chain that results from mutation of the arginine to lysine does not favor the interaction of this residue with D91 (helix 2), thus mimicking the breakage of the D91-R143 interaction observed in the A293E and D142A mutants This interaction pattern results in the opening of a site in the cytosolic domains that is similar to that found in the structures of the constitutively active mutants

R143, displayed a small degree of agonist-independent activity and was modestly impaired in its ability to mediate the epinephrine-induced IP response (Table 1 and Fig In contrast to R143K and R143H

R143A, R143N, R143I, and R143E Similar structural changes are also found in the weakly constitutively active mutant R143H, in which the protonated H143 is surrounded by a cluster of aromatic amino acids (F83, Y144, Y348, and F355), whereas D91 is involved in H-bonding interactions with N63 and N344 (results not shown) However, the lower constitutive activity of R143H with respect to R143K may be attributable, at least in part, to the fact that a fraction of uncharged H143 might exist at physiological pH because it is close to positively charged amino acids that may contribute to decrease its pKa In the R143D mutant, which also displays a low level of constitutive activity, the interactions of D91 resemble those found in the R143H mutant (results not shown) A small increase in the

mutant, the basal IP accumulation was over 200% above that of cells expressing the wild-type receptor This constitutive activity of the R143K mutant was inhibited by the 1-antagonist prazosin (results not shown) In contrast to R143K and R143H receptors, neither R143A, R143N, R143I, nor R143E displayed any constitutive activity Thus, to further characterize the properties of the 1b-AR mutants carrying mutations of R143, we measured the phosphorylation of the R143A, R143E, and R143K receptors in intact cells 2, for the constitutively active R143K receptor, both the basal and agonist-induced phosphorylation levels were significantly increased by 50% above those of the wild-type 1b-AR The enhanced basal phosphorylation observed for the R143K mutant is reminiscent of the properties of other constitutively active adrenergic receptor mutants (Ren et al., 1993; Pei et al., 1994), which might represent substrates for GPCR kinases even in the absence of the agonist COS-7 cells were transfected with the cDNA encoding the wild-type 1b-AR (WT) or its mutants R143K, R143H, R143D, R143A, R143N, R143I, and R143E However, the lower constitutive activity of R143H with respect to R143K may be attributable, at least in part, to the fact that a fraction of uncharged H143 might exist at physiological pH because it is close to positively charged amino acids that may contribute to decrease its pKa However, although the cytosolic domains of R143D reveal a site exposed to the solvent, K291 in the i3 loop is less exposed to the cytosol than in the highly constitutively active mutant R143K because it interacts with the aspartate substituted at position 143 COS-7 cells were transfected with the cDNA encoding the wild-type 1b-AR (WT) or its mutants R143A, R143E, and R143K The four panels display the results of MD simulations carried on the wild-type 1b-AR (ground state), the constitutively active mutants A293E and R143K, and the activation-deficient mutant R143E Consistent with its increased binding affinity, the potency of epinephrine at the R143K mutant was greater than at the wild-type receptor (EC50 values from one experiment were 2.9 10 8 M and 5 10 9 M at the 1b-AR and R143K mutant, respectively) In particular, the affinity of the R143E mutant for epinephrine was 250-fold higher than that of the wild-type 1b-AR and even 10-fold higher than that of the constitutively active receptor R143K Comparison of the Constitutively Active Receptors R143K and A293E with the Inactive Mutant R143E To better understand the nature of the increased affinity for agonist binding of the activation-defective R143 mutants, we compared the ligand-binding properties of the inactive receptor R143E with those of the two constitutively active mutants, R143K and A293E First, we assessed the intrinsic activities of seven structurally different agonists; second, we measured the binding affinity of the various agonists at the wild-type 1b-AR, R143E, R143K, and A293E receptors The two constitutively active mutations, A293E and R143K, produced similar affinity shifts for all the agonists tested, whereas the shifts induced by R143E were much greater The affinity of epinephrine for the wild-type as well as for the three receptor mutants (A293E, R143K, and R143E) was not influenced by Fig Relationship between the intrinsic activity and the affinity shift for various ligands at the receptor mutants A293E, R143K, and R143E The Ki of different agonists was assessed in membranes from COS-7 cells expressing the wild type 1bAR or its mutants A293E, R143K, and

affinity shifts caused by the mutations R143E, R143K, and A293E for the seven different agonists were plotted as a function of the agonist intrinsic activities measured at wildtype receptor (Fig The increase in isomerization constant is similar for the constitutively active mutants A293E and R143K, but it seems to be much greater for the activation-deficient mutant R143E Therefore, compared with the constitutively active mutants R143K and A293E, the inactive mutant R143E exhibits a similar pattern but with a much greater efficacy-related shift in binding affinity Thus, an alternative explanation is that the R143E mutation enhances J to a much greater extent than R143K and A293E mutations, but unlike those constitutive activating mutations, it also produces a dramatic reduction of the constant In fact, mutations of R143 with either neutral or negatively charged amino acids (Ala, Asn, Ile, Asp, and Glu) profoundly impaired the agonist-induced receptor response, which was preserved only in the R143K mutant (Fig In fact, the R143K mutant displayed several features characteristic of constitutively active receptors, including increased constitutive activity (Fig In particular, for both the constitutively active R143K and the activation-deficient R143E mutants, the affinity shift was 226 Scheer et al The relationship between the affinity shift and the intrinsic activity of the ligands observed for the A293E, R143K, and R143E mutants suggests that the isomerization equilibrium constant of the receptor (J), starting from a very small pre-existing value of the wild-type receptor, is progressively increased for the different mutants [i.e., wild-type 1b-AR A293E R143K R143E (Fig For A293E and R143K, the increase of the J value is consistent with the fact that these mutants are constitutively active [i.e., the isomerization equilibrium is displaced toward the active (R*) states] However, only in the R143K, R143H, and R143D mutants, which display various levels of constitutive activity, does the arrangement and the orientation of the cytosolic loops form structures that are similar to those described previously for the "active" forms of the receptor (compare R143K and A293E in Fig On the other hand, in the activation-deficient mutants, the arrangement of the cytosolic loops is different than that of the active receptors, A293E and R143K (Fig However, the results of thermodynamic analysis and of MD simulations of the receptor mutants could provide some hypothesis suggesting that R143 in the 1b-AR plays a role in receptor isomerization toward different states, which are best represented by the mutants R143K and R143E The other mutants of R143 share features of both the R143K and R143E receptors

mutant Concentration-response curves for NT-stimulated IP production (A) and inhibition of NT-stimulated IP production by SR 48692 (B), SR 48527 (C), and SR 49711 (D) in cells transfected with the wild type rNTR1 (open symbols) and the R327M mutant (closed symbols) SR 48692 Binding Site in Neurotensin Receptor 16354 The large decrease in potency of SR 48692 observed with the R327M mutant receptor is compatible with the side chain of Arg327 making an ionic link with the carboxylic function of the antagonist To assess this hypothesis, two enantiomeric SR 48692 analogs, SR 48527 and SR 49711, were tested for their ability to inhibit NT-stimulated IP production in COS M6 transfected with either the wild type rNTR1 or the R327M mutant receptor Therefore, we reasoned that the R327M mutation should much more greatly affect the interaction of SR 48527 than that of SR 49711 with the rNTR1 In cells expressing the R327M mutant, the potency of SR 48527 to antagonize NT-stimulated IP production was reduced by a 100-fold, whereas that of SR 49711 was barely affected One important step in the TABLE III Potencies of SR 48692 and its analogs for inhibiting neurotensin-stimulated IP production in wild type rNTR1and R327M rNTR1-transfected COS M6 cells COS M6 cells were transfected with the wild type rNTR1 and the R327M mutant and NT-stimulated IP production was measured as described under "Experimental Procedures." EC50 values for NT are derived from Fig Wild type R327M nM NT, EC50 0.57 0.20 11,900 3300 SR 48692, Ki 2.45 0.60 1570 470 SR 48527, Ki 24.4 6.3 1670 610 SR 49711, Ki 11,200 2800 14,900 7600 FIG The R327M mutant receptor was devoid of measurable SR 48692 and NT binding Indeed, we have observed with the wild type rNTR1 that maximally stimulated IP production is directly related to the amount of transfected receptor.4 In addition, this shows that the R327M mutant is accessible to NT and functional, and, therefore, provides indirect evidence that its conformation was not dramatically changed by the mutation SR 48692 inhibited NT-stimulated IP production with a 600-fold decreased potency in COS M6 cells transfected with the R327M mutant as compared with the wild type receptor The fact that the inhibitory potency of SR 49711 was not affected by the R327M mutation, in contrast to that of SR 48692 and SR 48527, strongly argues in favor of the existence of an ionic link between Arg327 and the carboxylic function of the antagonist In contrast, mutations Y324A and F331A in TM 6, and Y351A and Y359A in TM 7, yielded receptors that showed no measurable [3H]SR 48692 binding These mutations either did not affect the affinity of NT (Y324A, F358A, and Y359A) or resulted in a 10-fold decrease in affinity (F331A, Y351A) (Table I) The Y351A mutant, the Y324A and F331A mutants, and the Y359A

9452461	This finding is similar to the result observed in an analogous C128F mutation of the 1bAR, which exhibits selective constitutive coupling to inositol metabolism over the arachidonic acid pathway (13) Work in our laboratory with C116F 2AR and C128F 1bAR has formed the basis of an emerging hypothesis suggesting that receptors are * This work was supported in part by National Institutes of Health Grant RO152544 and an unrestricted grant from Glaxo Wellcome (to D Since we have postulated that the equivalent mutation in the 1bAR (C128F) is involved in modulation of an important salt bridge constraint that stabilizes the inactive conformation (25), it is possible to envision that C116F is influencing a similar constraining factor Analogous to the C116F 2AR, a C128F mutation of the 1bAR exhibited a selective constitutive coupling to one second messenger over another Comparatively, an A293E mutation of this receptor exhibited constitutive activity (32) that was distinct from the C128F mutant because of constitutive coupling to both pathways (13) The ability of the C128F mutant to achieve a presumed Gq-coupled/Gi/o-uncoupled state in the absence of agonist could simply be a manifestation of more efficient coupling to Gq, the supposed primary second messenger pathway in the 1bAR system It was argued, however, that the R state of the C128F mutant receptor did not isomerize to a single active conformation Given the results of this earlier study, either the G 13/NHE1 pathway is a more efficient coupler to 2ARs than the Gs/cAMP pathway, or the conclusions of the C128F 1bAR study are valid This selectivity was identified by comparing binding and signaling characteristics of wild-type (WT) versus C116F mutant receptors transiently transfected into COS-1 cells Indicating constitutive activity, ligand binding to the C116F mutant showed a 78-fold higher than WT affinity for isoproterenol and a 40-fold lower than WT affinity for ICI 118551 Although agonist-independent activation of cAMP production was not exhibited by the C116F mutant, a constitutive stimulation of the Na /H exchanger (NHE1) was observed Due to a higher rate of H efflux through NHE1, C116F transfectants exhibited a significantly higher pHi (7.42) than did WT transfectants (7.1) These findings, which show that a C116F mutation of the 2-adrenergic receptor evokes selective constitutive coupling to NHE1 over cAMP, form the basis of our prediction that multiple and distinct activation states can exist in G protein-coupled receptors Interestingly, the C116F mutation induces a receptor conformation that constitutively activates Na /H exchange while only maintaining competent coupling to cAMP Work in our laboratory with C116F 2AR and C128F 1bAR has formed the basis of an emerging hypothesis suggesting that receptors are * This work was supported in part by National Institutes of Health Grant RO152544 and an unrestricted grant from Glaxo Wellcome (to D To minimize variation, WT and C116F 2AR binding experiments were always performed simultaneously cAMP Determination--Accumulation of cAMP in WT and C116F 2AR transfectants was measured using a commercially available cAMP assay system (Amersham Corp.) according to the directions supplied by the manufacturer RESULTS Pharmacological Comparison of WT and Mutant Receptors-- Receptor density and [125I]CYP binding affinity were determined in COS-1 cells transfected with either the WT 2AR cDNA or the C116F mutant Binding of the radioligand was statistically best fit to a one-site model with mean KD values for the WT and C116F receptors of 97.3 and 125.1 pM, respectively (data not shown) The potency of various ligands to inhibit specific [125I]CYP binding to membranes from WT or C116F receptor-transfected COS-1 cells is shown in Table I 2-Agonists and partial agonists that were tested showed a 6 78-fold higher binding affinity for C116F mutant receptors than for WT receptors Comparatively, the antagonists ICI 188551, pindolol, and alprenolol exhibited the binding properties of inverse agonism by showing a 3 40-fold higher affinity for the WT receptor than for the C116F mutant Untransfected and WT and C116F 2AR-transfected COS-1 cells were loaded with BCECF and prepared for fluorescence assay The standard curves seen in untransfected and WT and C116F receptortransfected cells were similar Selective Constitutive Signaling in 2-Adrenergic Receptors 3402 shift of agonist affinity seen for the C116F mutant was examined by performing competition studies in the absence and presence of 0.1 mM Gpp(NH)p Stimulation of cAMP Formation--Functional coupling of WT and C116F 2ARs to the cAMP pathway was examined by measuring accumulation of cAMP For this experiment, the transfection protocol was modified to assure similar receptor expression levels in WT and C116F transfectants 2 compares the isoproterenol concentration dependence of cAMP production in cells expressing similar levels of either WT or C116F receptors Arguing against constitutive coupling to G s and cAMP production, the C116F mutant receptor did not evoke a response in the absence of isoproterenol, and it did not affect the potency of isoproterenol to evoke a response compared with the WT receptor Like isoproterenol, epinephrine concentration-response curves and EC50 values seen in WT and C116F transfectants were not different (data not shown) Stimulation of Na /H Exchange--A possible alternative constitutive coupling of C116F 2ARs to G 13 and downstream NHE1 was initially examined by studying the effect of this hypothetical constitutive activity on basal pHi Continuous stimulation of H extrusion through the Na /H exchanger by a constitutively active C116F mutant receptor would likely cause cytosolic alkalosis 3 illustrates that C116F receptortransfected cells had a significantly more alkaline pHi (7.42) than either WT transfectants (7.1) or untransfected cells (7.04) As expected, intracellular alkalosis in the C116F transfectants was inhibited by inactivating the mutant receptors with the inverse agonist ICI 188551 (10 5 M) The apparent constitutive coupling of the C116F 2AR to Na /H exchange was further examined by measuring the rate of pHi recovery from cellular acid load COS-1 cells transfected with either the WT or C116F 2AR cDNA were loaded with H by a 6-min exposure to 20 mM NH4Cl Rate of recovery from this acid load (dpHi/dt) was compared in WT and C116F transfectants under various conditions A time course of the pHi changes that occur during acid load in C116F receptor-transfected cells is shown in Fig The efficacy of isoproterenol to evoke a cAMP response was tested in COS-1 cells transfected with either the WT or C116F 2AR Mean receptor expression in WT and C116F receptor-transfected cells was 0.063 and 0.056 pmol/mg, respectively TABLE I Pharmacological characterization of WT and C116F 2ARs COS-1 membranes, prepared from cells transfected with

expressing either WT or C116F 2ARs A significantly more rapid recovery was seen in C116F transfectants than in either WT transfectants or untransfected control cells (Fig Furthermore, activation of WT receptors with 10 6 M epinephrine stimulated dpHi/dt to the rate seen in C116F transfectants, whereas treatment with 10 5 M ICI 118551 had no effect Comparatively, treatment of the C116F mutant receptor with 10 5 M ICI 118551 significantly reduced dpHi/dt to a value near that seen in WT transfectants, whereas stimulation with 10 6 M epinephrine had no effect Effect of the C116F mutation on pHi pHi was determined in BCECF-loaded COS-1 cells that either were untransfected (UT) or were transfected with the WT 2AR cDNA (WT), the C116F 2AR cDNA (C116F), or the mutant cDNA and then treated with 10 5 M ICI 118551 for 16 h prior to and during assay (C116F ICI) Mean receptor expression in WT and C116F receptortransfected cells was 0.398 and 0.058 pmol/mg of protein, respectively COS-1 cells transfected with the C116F 2AR cDNA were loaded with BCECF and prepared for fluorescence assay COS-1 cells that either were untransfected (UT) or were transfected with the WT 2AR cDNA (WT) or the C116F 2AR cDNA (C116F) were loaded with BCECF and prepared for fluorescence assay B, the rate of pHi recovery from acid load, termed dpHi/dt, was determined in untransfected cells and in WT and C116F transfectants under various conditions Besides the untreated cases that summarize the pHi tracings shown in A, 10 5 M ICI 118551 was added to both WT and C116F transfectants for 16 h prior to and during assay (WT ICI and C116F ICI, respectively) Epinephrine (10 6 M) was also given to both WT and mutant transfectants for 15 min prior to and during assay (WT Epi and C116F Epi, respectively) Mean receptor expression in WT and C116F receptor-transfected cells was 0.398 and 0.058 pmol/mg of protein, respectively Based on these tenets of the model, the higher than WT binding affinity of common 2-agonists seen for the C116F 2AR (Table I) is strongly suggestive of constitutive receptor activity Also supporting this hypothesis, the 2-inverse agonist ICI 118551 exhibited a higher affinity for the WT receptor than for the C116F mutant (Table I) The C116F mutation could evoke these shifts in ligand binding affinity in one of two ways Since we have postulated that the equivalent mutation in the 1bAR (C128F) is involved in modulation of an important salt bridge constraint that stabilizes the inactive conformation (25), it is possible to envision that C116F is influencing a similar constraining factor Even though the binding data allude to a constitutive activity induced by the C116F mutation, agonist-independent generation of a second messenger signal must be identified to firmly establish this hypothesis Based on this, agonist-dependent and -independent effects on cAMP production were compared in WT and C116F receptor-transfected COS-1 cells Not only did the C116F mutation fail to potentiate the isoproterenol dose response (EC50) relative to the WT receptor, it also failed to evoke a response in the absence of the agonist (Fig These findings indicate that the C116F mutation does not facilitate constitutive coupling to G s If the 2AR indeed only signals through a coupling to G s, these data would suggest that the C116F mutation affects ligand binding without inducing the receptor to assume an activated conformation that is competent to couple to a second messenger signal With G s-independent coupling of 2ARs to NHE1 having been established, questions are raised about possible effects of the C116F 2AR mutant on Na /H exchange Basal pHi was determined in WT and C116F receptor-transfected COS-1 cells Due to continuous H extrusion during the posttransfection period, possible constitutive activation of NHE1 induced by the C116F mutation would be detected via identification of a cytosolic alkalosis relative to pHi values seen in the WT case However, since pHi is not a direct measure of NHE1 activity, the actual rate of NHE1 function was also determined in WT and C116F transfectants by measuring the rate of pHi recovery following NH4Cl-induced cellular acid load In the first experiment, intracellular alkalosis was evident in C116F receptor-transfected COS-1 cells relative to pHi levels seen in WT transfectants (Fig This was despite a 6.8-fold lower number of receptors in the C116F case These findings not only provide strong evidence of a constitutive activation of Na /H exchange in C116F receptor-transfected cells, but the effect is shown to be 2-receptor-specific based on inhibition by the 2-selective inverse agonist In the second experiment, cells transfected with the C116F 2AR showed a significantly faster rate of pHi recovery from acid load than WT transfectants As before, this significant difference was seen despite a 6.8-fold lower receptor number in the C116F receptor-transfected cells Further implicating the 2AR as a regulator of NHE1, activation of the WT receptor with epinephrine caused an increase in dpHi/dt to values seen in the C116F case, whereas inactivation of the C116F receptor with ICI 118551 reduced dpHi/dt to values seen in the WT case These results (a) corroborate earlier findings demonstrating coupling of 2ARs to NHE1, (b) indicate selective constitutive coupling of the C116F 2AR to NHE1, and (c) establish a role for Cys-116 in regulating selective coupling of the 2AR to either the cAMP pathway or NHE1 Interestingly, epinephrine did not affect the rate of H extrusion seen in C116F receptor-transfected cells (Fig It is possible that the C116F mutation had itself induced a maximal Selective Constitutive Signaling in 2-Adrenergic Receptors 3405 shift of receptor equilibrium toward R* Based on the data presented in this report, a model is established that shows selective constitutive activation of NHE1 over cAMP in 2ARs possessing a C116F mutation (Fig The model predicts that under basal conditions, the C116F mutant will preferentially isomerize to a conformation that couples putatively to G 13 (R* G 13) DRY, an important functional domain for the binding of G proteins and the catalysis of GDP release (31), provides a convenient reference for comparing the C116F 2 mutation with similar point mutations in 1bARs, AT1 receptors (Fig Analogous to the C116F 2AR, a C128F mutation of the 1bAR exhibited a selective constitutive coupling to one second messenger over another Selective constitutive activation of NHE1 by the C116F 2AR Under basal conditions (without agonist present), the C116F 2AR isomerizes preferentially to the G 13-coupled active state (R* G 13) In the AT1 system, the constitutively active mutant N111G exhibited higher than WT activation of inositol metabolism under basal conditions (33) (33) suggested that the N111G mutation induced a transition of the receptor from R to a partially activated intermediate (R ) Supporting their model, agonistic ligands induced full activation of inositol metabolism by the N111G mutant, suggesting that transition of the mutant receptor from R to the fully activated R* conformation could be achieved Comparatively, an A293E mutation of this receptor exhibited constitutive activity (32) that was distinct from the C128F mutant because of constitutive coupling to both pathways (13)

10074102	We also substituted alanine for tyrosine (Y184A) and isoleucine residues (I185A) and replaced phenylalanine residues by glycine (F199G) or leucine (F201G) All of these mutants mediated infection of U373MG-CD4 cells by HIV-1LAI with an efficiency similar or even higher than WT rat CXCR4, but none of them, including D192N, S193D, or their combination, mediated detectable HIV-1NDK infection (Fig The mutation of the corresponding residue in rat CXCR4 (M196V) also markedly reduced expression The D182G, I185A, F199G, and F201L mutations increased the efficiency of infection by one or FIG Some mutants did not have the c-MYC tag (D182G, D193R, D193N, and D193E) or were not tested (F201L) but reacted with the 12G5 MAb-like WT human CXCR4 Several mutations resulted in a lower efficiency of infection, either for all of the strains tested (R183A, R188A, and D193A) or for certain strains only (D181A, Y184A, I185A, and D187A) Also, the gain of a negative charge (N192D) was associated with a reduced efficiency of infection by HIV-1LAI and HIV-1NDK, as were mutations resulting in the loss of a positive charge (R183A and R188A) Except for D182G, D193E, D193N, and D193R, all mutants were created in the epitope-tagged human or rat CXCR4, obtained by subcloning the corresponding cDNA in the pcDNA3-Myc vector (38) To address the possible role of electrostatic interactions between ECL2 and HIV-1 gp120, we have tested CXCR4 mutants in which a charged residue (Asp181, Asp187, Arg183, or Arg188) was replaced by an alanine, along with the previously described D182G and D193A mutants The D182G, I185A, F199G, and F201L mutations increased the efficiency of infection by one or FIG The WT human and rat CXCR4 and all derived mutants (excepted D182G) bear a MYC epitope tag at their amino terminus Some mutants did not have the c-MYC tag (D182G, D193R, D193N, and D193E) or were not tested (F201L) but reacted with the 12G5 MAb-like WT human CXCR4 This was not the case for the D182G mutant, for which the surface expression was tested with the 6H8 MAb raised against the amino-terminal extracellular domain of CXCR4 All mutants (excepted D182G) and WT were MYC tagged While the Asp193 mutations reduced the efficiency of infection by all strains tested, no consistent pattern emerged for mutations resulting in a loss of net negative charge (D181A, D182G, and D187A) or their effects were strain selective All mutants (excepted D182G) are MYC tagged We also substituted alanine for tyrosine (Y184A) and isoleucine residues (I185A) and replaced phenylalanine residues by glycine (F199G) or leucine (F201G) Several mutations resulted in a lower efficiency of infection, either for all of the strains tested (R183A, R188A, and D193A) or for certain strains only (D181A, Y184A, I185A, and D187A) The D182G, I185A, F199G, and F201L mutations increased the efficiency of infection by one or FIG All of these mutants, except V196M (Fig The V196M mutation prevented expression of CXCR4 at the cell surface, thereby explaining the lack of HIV-1 coreceptor activity of this mutant All other mutants tested (excluding V196M) yielded fractions of 12G5-positive cells comparable to WT human CXCR4 Except for D182G, D193E, D193N, and D193R, all mutants were created in the epitope-tagged human or rat CXCR4, obtained by subcloning the corresponding cDNA in the pcDNA3-Myc vector (38) A reduced efficiency of infection was seen upon replacing Asp193 by a serine (D193S), an asparagine (D193N), or an arginine (D193R) Some mutants did not have the c-MYC tag (D182G, D193R, D193N, and D193E) or were not tested (F201L) but reacted with the 12G5 MAb-like WT human CXCR4 Several mutations resulted in a lower efficiency of infection, either for all of the strains tested (R183A, R188A, and D193A) or for certain strains only (D181A, Y184A, I185A, and D187A) In contrast, when a series of human CXCR4 mutants in which residues in ECL2 had been replaced with alanine were assayed for the ability to support fusion mediated by FIV, three mutations were detected that either markedly reduced the efficiency of human CXCR4 to support fusion (40 to 50% with the D181A and Y184A mutants) or abolished receptor function completely (D187A mutant) While the Asp193 mutations reduced the efficiency of infection by all strains tested, no consistent pattern emerged for mutations resulting in a loss of net negative charge (D181A, D182G, and D187A) or their effects were strain selective Interestingly, the D187A mutation allowed fusion with an R5 HIV-1 strain (55), suggesting that the chemokine receptor binding site in HIV gp120 is a relatively conserved structure and that minor changes in either the chemokine receptor or the viral gp120 determine the specificity of coreceptor usage In this study, we observed that the D187A mutation completely ablated the usage of CXCR4 as a receptor by FIV, suggesting that the conservation of gp120 structure may extend to the feline lentiviruses Except for D182G, D193E, D193N, and D193R, all mutants were created in the epitope-tagged human or rat CXCR4, obtained by subcloning the corresponding cDNA in the pcDNA3-Myc vector (38) Substitutions of a glutamic acid (D193E) or an alanine (D193A) had no apparent effect on HIV-1 infection (or only for HIV-1OUA in the case of D193A) The results obtained with the D193E mutant indicated that the negative charge was not the only feature supporting the role of Asp193 The coreceptor activity of the D193E was indistinguishable from WT CXCR4 for the three other HIV-1 strains tested, while other mutations were associated with reduced efficiency of infection by one or several of these strains Some mutants did not have the c-MYC tag (D182G, D193R, D193N, and D193E) or were not tested (F201L) but reacted with the 12G5 MAb-like WT human CXCR4 Like all of the mutations of Asp193 tested, the D193E mutation markedly reduced the efficiency of HIV-1NDK infection Interestingly, most Asp193 mutations, but not D193E, also reduced the efficiency of infection by HIV-1LAI and other strains Substitutions of a glutamic acid (D193E) or an alanine (D193A) had no apparent effect on HIV-1 infection (or only for HIV-1OUA in the case of D193A) To address the possible role of electrostatic interactions between ECL2 and HIV-1 gp120, we have tested CXCR4 mutants in which a charged residue (Asp181, Asp187, Arg183, or Arg188) was replaced by an alanine, along with the previously described D182G and D193A mutants Several mutations resulted in a lower efficiency of infection, either for all of the strains tested (R183A, R188A, and D193A) or for certain strains only (D181A, Y184A, I185A, and D187A) However, the numbers of infected cells were at least 40% of those observed with WT CXCR4, except for HIV-1NDK infection mediated by the D193A mutant The D193A and D193S mutants are MYC tagged Certain Asp193 mutations (D193S and D193A) apparently reduced the reactivity with 12G5, but others had no such effect (e.g., D193R), suggesting that this residue is not directly part of the epitope Several mutations resulted in a lower efficiency of infection, either for all of the strains tested (R183A, R188A, and D193A) or for certain strains only (D181A, Y184A, I185A, and D187A) In contrast, when a series of human CXCR4 mutants in which residues in ECL2

and isoleucine residues (I185A) and replaced phenylalanine residues by glycine (F199G) or leucine (F201G) The D182G, I185A, F199G, and F201L mutations increased the efficiency of infection by one or FIG The higher efficiency of infection mediated by the F199G mutant was not due to an increased level of expression Except for D182G, D193E, D193N, and D193R, all mutants were created in the epitope-tagged human or rat CXCR4, obtained by subcloning the corresponding cDNA in the pcDNA3-Myc vector (38) A reduced efficiency of infection was seen upon replacing Asp193 by a serine (D193S), an asparagine (D193N), or an arginine (D193R) In particular, the D193R mutant was apparently unable to mediate infection by this strain Some mutants did not have the c-MYC tag (D182G, D193R, D193N, and D193E) or were not tested (F201L) but reacted with the 12G5 MAb-like WT human CXCR4 Certain Asp193 mutations (D193S and D193A) apparently reduced the reactivity with 12G5, but others had no such effect (e.g., D193R), suggesting that this residue is not directly part of the epitope Noteworthy, the negative effect of the D193S mutation was compensated for by another mutation (N192D) impairing HIV-1LAI infection Since the D193S mutation prevented usage of the human CXCR4 coreceptor by HIV-1NDK and impaired its utilization by HIV-1LAI, we have tested the effect of substituting other amino acids for Asp193 A reduced efficiency of infection was seen upon replacing Asp193 by a serine (D193S), an asparagine (D193N), or an arginine (D193R) Some human CXCR4 mutants displaying a reduced HIV-1 coreceptor activity, in particular D193S, were expressed at a relatively low level The D193A and D193S mutants are MYC tagged Certain Asp193 mutations (D193S and D193A) apparently reduced the reactivity with 12G5, but others had no such effect (e.g., D193R), suggesting that this residue is not directly part of the epitope Noteworthy, the negative effect of the D193S mutation was compensated for by another mutation (N192D) impairing HIV-1LAI infection Also, the gain of a negative charge (N192D) was associated with a reduced efficiency of infection by HIV-1LAI and HIV-1NDK, as were mutations resulting in the loss of a positive charge (R183A and R188A) We also substituted alanine for tyrosine (Y184A) and isoleucine residues (I185A) and replaced phenylalanine residues by glycine (F199G) or leucine (F201G) Several mutations resulted in a lower efficiency of infection, either for all of the strains tested (R183A, R188A, and D193A) or for certain strains only (D181A,

three mutations were detected that either markedly reduced the efficiency of human CXCR4 to support fusion (40 to 50% with the D181A and Y184A mutants) or abolished receptor function completely (D187A mutant) All of these mutants mediated infection of U373MG-CD4 cells by HIV-1LAI with an efficiency similar or even higher than WT rat CXCR4, but none of them, including D192N, S193D, or their combination, mediated detectable HIV-1NDK infection (Fig Several mutations resulted in a lower efficiency of infection, either for all of the strains tested (R183A, R188A, and D193A) or for certain strains only (D181A, Y184A, I185A, and D187A) Also, the gain of a negative charge (N192D) was associated with a reduced efficiency of infection by HIV-1LAI and HIV-1NDK, as were mutations resulting in

affinity of CPPMA, we brought together the V91F, F110L, and Y408V mutations in various combinations Combination of V91F with F110L or with Y408V did not result in a substantial additional gain in affinity for CPPMA The combination of F110L and Y408V, however, resulted in an additive gain in affinity of 16-fold, and the simultaneous combination of all three mutations led to a receptor with 151-fold higher affinity than D2 receptor (Table 3 and Fig In an attempt to construct a D2 receptor mutant with D4-like affinity for CPPMA, we further mutated, in the V91F/F110L/Y408V background, the nonconserved, accessible residues adjacent to Val91 and/or Phe110 Mutation of Val111 to Met, the aligned D4 residue, combined with V91F/ F110L/Y408V resulted in a receptor with an affinity for CPPMA 4800-fold higher than the D2 receptor (Table 3 and Fig W90L/V91F/L94S/F110L/V111M/Y408V also displayed D4-like affinity for CPPMA and N-methylspiperone As we observed for CPPMA, mutation of

values were calculated as described in Experimental Procedures The combination of the four mutations V91F/F110L/V111M/ Y408V in the D2 receptor increased the binding affinity of CPPMA by three orders of magnitude to D4-like affinity (Fig Although the solitary mutation of Val111(3.29) to Met did not affect CPPMA affinity, combination of this mutation with V91F/F110L/Y408V led to a greater than 30-fold increase in CPPMA affinity to D4-like levels Ro 61-6270 had properties similar to those of CPPMA, in that mutation of the four residues (V91F/F110L/ V111M/Y408V) was sufficient to convert the receptor fully to D4-like affinity with this, the mutation of W90L and L94S combined with V91F/F110L/V111M/Y408V more fully converted the affinity of Ro 62-4599 and Ro 10-4548 toward D4-like values Combining the substitutions of the five residues in M2 and M3 of the D4 receptor nonconserved and accessible in the D2 receptor (L90W/F91V/S94L/L111F/M112V) reduced the affinity of CPPMA 600-fold,

affinities of antagonists for wild-type D4 and D2 receptors and mutant D4 receptors KD values and KI values were calculated as described in Experimental Procedures The combination of the four mutations V91F/F110L/V111M/ Y408V in the D2 receptor increased the binding affinity of CPPMA by three orders of magnitude to D4-like affinity (Fig Although the solitary mutation of Val111(3.29) to Met did not affect CPPMA affinity, combination of this mutation with V91F/F110L/Y408V led to a greater than 30-fold increase in CPPMA affinity to D4-like levels Ro 61-6270 had properties similar to those of CPPMA, in that mutation of the four residues (V91F/F110L/ V111M/Y408V) was sufficient to convert the receptor fully to D4-like affinity with this, the mutation of W90L and L94S combined with V91F/F110L/V111M/Y408V more fully converted the affinity of Ro 62-4599 and Ro 10-4548 toward D4-like values F110L and Y408V had 5and 3-fold increased affinity, respectively, for CPPMA F189Y and Y408V had approximately 5-fold higher affinities for clozapine than did the D2 receptor Because single substitutions of Phe110 to Leu and Tyr408 to Val also had greater than 3-fold effects on the affinity of CPPMA, we brought together the V91F, F110L, and Y408V mutations in various combinations Combination of V91F with F110L or with Y408V did not result in a substantial additional gain in affinity for CPPMA The combination of F110L and Y408V, however, resulted in an additive gain in affinity of 16-fold, and the simultaneous combination of all three mutations led to a receptor with 151-fold higher affinity than D2 receptor (Table 3 and Fig In an attempt to construct a D2 receptor mutant with D4-like affinity for CPPMA, we further mutated, in the V91F/F110L/Y408V background, the nonconserved, accessible residues adjacent to Val91 and/or Phe110 Mutation of Val111 to Met, the aligned D4 residue, combined with V91F/ F110L/Y408V resulted in a receptor with an affinity for CPPMA 4800-fold higher than the D2 receptor (Table 3 and Fig W90L/V91F/L94S/F110L/V111M/Y408V also displayed D4-like affinity for CPPMA and N-methylspiperone As we observed for CPPMA, mutation of V91F/F110L/Y408V was insufficient to produce full D4-like affinity for these compounds, but Ro 61-6270 bound to V91F/F110L/V111M/ Y408V with D4-like affinity, as did CPPMA Ro 10-4548 and Ro 62-4599 bound V91F/F110L/V111M/Y408V with intermediate affinity In contrast, for the six-residue mutant W90L/ V91F/L94S/F110L/V111M/Y408V, Ro 10-4548 bound with D4-like affinity and Ro 62-4599 bound with 1600-fold

stabilizing the Schiff base (16, 19, 20) and the demonstration that the role of Glu113 can be replaced by the A117E or A117D mutation (21, 22) Here, we combined the mutant opsin G121L with second site replacements of four different amino acid residues on TM helix 6: Met257, Val258, Phe261, or Trp265 We show that the loss of function phenotypes of the G121L mutant described above can be partially reverted specifically by the mutation of Phe261, a residue highly conserved in all G protein-coupled receptors For example, the double-replacement mutant G121L/F261A has spectral, chromophore-binding, and transducin-activating properties intermediate between those of G121L and rhodopsin This rescue of the G121L defects did not occur with the other second site mutations tested Mutant G121L was prepared as reported (5) For example, the G121L mutant reconstituted very poorly with 11-cis-retinal and displayed a max value of 475 nm Remarkably, the double mutant G121L/ F261A reconstituted with chromophore to the same extent as F261A and displayed a max value of 482 nm (Fig The ability of the second site mutation at position Phe261 to rescue the defect in the G121L mutant depended on the residue substituting for phenylalanine The G121L/F261W mutant did not show a reversion, and the G121L/F261T and G121L/F261V mutants had intermediate reversion when compared with that of mutant

double mutant G121L/F261T showed an activity phenotype similar to that of G121L/F261A (Table III) The highest levels of activity were displayed by the double mutants G121L/F261V and G121L/M257A, which showed constitutive activities of 48 and 46%, respectively Other mutants with high levels of constitutive activity included G121L/F261T (13%) and E113A/ G121L (35%) As reported in the preceding paper (5), the G121L mutant opsin did not display constitutive activity but did show an unusually high level of activity in the presence of all-transretinal However, the double mutant G121L/F261A was intermediate between the two single mutants in its ability to activate transducin in the presence of all-trans-retinal (Table III and Fig This result shows that the F261A substitution can partially rescue the phenotype of the G121L mutant in terms of the specificity of the chromophore-binding pocket for all-trans-retinal The first salient result is that the combination of the G121L mutation with a second mutation at one of several sites, including Glu113, Met257, or Phe261 (but not Trp265), resulted in a double mutant opsin with significant constitutive activity The second salient result is that the property of the G121L mutant to bind all-trans-retinal in membranes, which was described in the preceding paper (5), could be partially prevented by a second site replacement of Phe261 by a

efficiently to enter the chromophore-binding pocket to activate the mutant apoprotein Again, the rescue of the G121L phenotype was not seen with second site mutations at the other positions studied 2 that in detergent solution the defect in the ability of mutant pigment F261A to activate transducin upon illumination was restored nearly to normal by the second site G121L mutation Whereas the single

G121L/F261V and G121L/M257A might involve either indirect effects of the mutations on cytoplasmic loop conformations, effects on the pKa values of Glu113 or Lys296, or a combination of these two

fact, mutant pigments with large side chains at either or both positions (G121L/F261W, G121L/F261A,T,V) displayed transducin activity levels that were closer to that of rhodopsin In this regard, the activation of the G121L opsin shows similarity to these receptors in that this mutant opsin is more readily activated (in the absence of light) by the entry of the agonist, all-trans-retinal, into the binding pocket In summary, we have demonstrated that the specific phenotype exemplified by mutant G121L can be partially reverted by a second site F261A mutation Four Phe261 mutants were

ability of mutant pigment F261A to activate transducin upon illumination was restored nearly to normal by the second site G121L mutation In the double mutant G121L/F261A, a smaller alanine residue at position 261 on TM helix 6 may compensate for any increased steric interaction caused by the leucine residue at position 121 In fact, mutant pigments with large side chains at either or both positions (G121L/F261W, G121L/F261A,T,V) displayed transducin activity levels that were closer to that of rhodopsin In summary, we have demonstrated that the specific phenotype exemplified by mutant G121L can be partially reverted by a second site F261A mutation In addition, mutants M257A, V258A, and W265Y were studied (Table II) The second site rescue of the spectral properties of the G121L mutant was not observed with the M257A, V258A, or W265Y mutations (Table II) Of the single-replacement mutants studied, only M257A displayed more than 10% constitutive activity The highest levels of activity were

Lys298 3 Stop, a mutant that does not bind PAF (control); A230E, D63N, D289A, and Y293A, mutants that do not couple to G-proteins or D289N, Y293F, Cys317 3 Stop, mutants that couple to G-proteins Despite the fact that loss of functional coupling seems to correlate with a decreased internalization for other receptors (3, 31) and for most of our uncoupled mutant receptors (D63N, A230E, and D289A), results obtained with pertussis toxin treatment and the Y293A mutant indicate that G-protein coupling and signalization do not participate in hPAFR internalization This loss of effector function could be the consequence of a structural change in the 7th transmembrane domain, as substitution of Asp285 3 Ile, in this domain, leads to a similar phenotype (41) To study the structural elements and mechanisms involved in the internalization of human PAF receptor (hPAFR), we used the following mutants: a truncated mutant in the C-terminal tail of the receptor (Cys317 3 Stop) and mutations in the (D/N)P(X)2,3Y motif (Asp289 3 Asn,Ala and Tyr293 3 Phe,Ala) Truncated forms, Cys317 3 Stop and Lys298 3 Stop, of the receptor were also constructed To construct these mutants the polymerase chain reaction product generated with the oligonucleotides 5 -CCACATGACTCCTCCCACATG-3 and 5 -GCCCGGGATCATTTCCGG-3 (Cys317 3 Stop) or 5 -CCAATTCTAGGTGAGGAAAC-3 (Lys298 3 Stop) were subcloned in the site Eco1CR1 of pJ3M vector Deletion mutants (Lys298 3 Stop and Cys317 3 Stop) are indicated by an arrow The deletion mutants, Cys317 3 Stop and Lys298 3 Stop, were made to analyze the involvement of the cytoplasmic tail in the internalization of the receptor The Lys298 3 Stop mutant was not illustrated as it did not bind either of the ligands, despite comparable cell-surface expression to the WT construct, as examined by cytofluorimetry with an anti-c-myc antibody (results not shown) In contrast, as observed with our Lys298 3 Stop mutant, a larger deletion in the cytoplasmic tail can confer a loss of binding capacity for both PAF and WEB2086 The role of the two motifs (D/N)P(X)2,3Y and YXX was evaluated with the mutant receptors Asp289 3 Ala,Asn (41) and Tyr293 3 Ala,Phe (this study) To study the structural elements and mechanisms involved in the internalization of human PAF receptor (hPAFR), we used the following mutants: a truncated mutant in the C-terminal tail of the receptor (Cys317 3 Stop) and mutations in the (D/N)P(X)2,3Y motif (Asp289 3 Asn,Ala and Tyr293 3 Phe,Ala) Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the Cys317 3 Stop mutant exhibited a marked reduction in their capacity to internalize PAF, suggesting the existence of determinants important for endocytosis in the last 26 amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail The presence of regulatory elements in the cytoplasmic tail was verified with the mutant Cys317 3 Stop that does not contain the last 26 amino acids of the C-terminal tail Truncated forms, Cys317 3 Stop and Lys298 3 Stop, of the receptor were also constructed To construct these mutants the polymerase chain reaction product generated with the oligonucleotides 5 -CCACATGACTCCTCCCACATG-3 and 5 -GCCCGGGATCATTTCCGG-3 (Cys317 3 Stop) or 5 -CCAATTCTAGGTGAGGAAAC-3 (Lys298 3 Stop) were subcloned in the site Eco1CR1 of pJ3M vector Deletion mutants (Lys298 3 Stop and Cys317 3 Stop) are indicated by an arrow The deletion mutants, Cys317 3 Stop and Lys298 3 Stop, were made to analyze the involvement of the cytoplasmic tail in the internalization of the receptor The binding characteristics of the WT receptor and the mutants, Cys317 3 Stop, Y293A, and Y293F, were examined in transiently transfected COS-7 cells using the agonist (PAF) and an antagonist (WEB2086) (Fig Similar levels of expression were also obtained in COS-7 as well as in CHO cells (WT, 962,310 163,592;

Fig The full rescue of Y326A mutant sequestration (39 7%) was observed only when ARK 1 and -arrestin were coexpressed Coexpression of the dominant negative ARK 1/K220M and -arrestin (data not shown) promoted sequestration no better than did -arrestin alone (16 3%), indicating that the catalytic activity of ARK 1 is required to promote the full potency of -arrestin to rescue the Y326A sequestration Effect of overexpression of ARK and -arrestin on the phosphorylation of the 2AR and Y326A receptors in COS cells In COS cells, the Y326A mutant was phosphorylated 10% as well as the wild-type receptor (Fig Overexpression of -arrestin 1 alone did not significantly affect the phosphorylation level of the Y326A mutant but decreased that of the wild-type 2AR significantly, suggesting that -arrestin 1 may be competing for the ability of endogenous kinases to interact with receptor or facilitating sequestration before kinase interaction Effect of overexpression of ARK and -arrestin on the sequestration of 2AR and 2AR-Y326A in COS cells Cells were transfected with the 2AR or Y326A mutant without (Mock) or with 1 g of plasmid containing ARK and/or -arrestin cDNA No increase was seen in the untransfected control cells or in cells transfected with the sequestration-defective Y326A mutant Effects of ARK and -arrestin on the phosphorylation of the 2AR and 2AR/Y326A mutants Cells were transfected with either the 2AR or Y326A mutant without (MOCK) or with 1 g of plasmid containing ARK (BARK1) and/or -arrestin (BARR1) cDNA Data for 2AR and Y326A were normalized to the increase in radioactivity above basal values obtained with the 2AR without any additional kinases (3.6 1.0-fold above basal 100%) Our conclusion stems from studies of the sequestration of the 2AR-Phos mutant in HEK 293 cells, the behavior of the 2AR and Y326A mutant in COS cells in the absence and presence of overexpressed ARK and -arrestin, the colocalization of 2AR and -arrestin 2 in the light vesicular fraction in CHO cells, and the correlation between sequestration and the product of ARK and -arrestin expression in five different cell types In COS cells, the wild-type 2AR and the ARK phosphorylation-impaired Y326A mutant sequester poorly The sequestration of the wild-type receptor is fully enhanced to levels comparable to HEK 293 cells by overexpression of -arrestin alone (but not ARK), whereas rescue of phosphorylation and sequestration for the Y326A mutant requires ARK and -arrestin In HEK 293 cells, overexpressed ARK was sufficient to rescue the phosphorylation and sequestration of the Y326A mutant receptor (11, 12, 14) Thus, in this model, the sequestration kinetics of a particular GPCR (e.g., the Y326A mutant 2AR) are regulated not only by the concentrations of ARK or -arrestin but also by the affinity of that receptor for each protein, as reflected by the kcj values

9312100	First, we replaced Thr394 with alanine (T394A) and stably expressed this mutant receptor in Chinese hamster ovary cells The T394A receptor did not desensitize after 1 h of treatment with DAMGO, indicating that Thr394 is required for agonist-induced early desensitization The specificity of Thr394 as the primary initiation site appears to be dependent on the preceding acidic amino acid stretch, because in a mutant in which glutamic acid residues at 388, 391, and 393 were replaced by glutamines (EQ), agonist-induced desensitization was completely abolished, identical to the T394A mutant Mutant MORs such as T394A, T/S363383A (AT), T/S363379A (ATT), E388 393Q (EQ) (Fig Initially, stable CHO cell lines expressing wild type or mutated receptor in which the Thr394 was changed to alanine (T394A) were prepared (Fig The binding of antagonist [3H]naloxone to the wild type or T394A mutant receptor was saturable and of high affinity To determine the functional coupling of the wild type and mutant receptors (T394A) to adenylyl cyclase, dose-response curves for the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation with increasing concentrations of DAMGO were tested The IC50 values for adenylyl cyclase inhibition for both receptors in CHO cells were identical; 8.5 2.6 nM (n 7) for wild type receptors and 5.6 1.2 nM (n 4) for mutant (T394A) receptors (Fig Strikingly, in the mutant receptor (T394A), agonistinduced desensitization of receptors was completely abolished, as indicated by the lack of rightward shift of the IC50 and a lack of reduction in the maximum inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation The IC50 for wild type receptor after 1 M DAMGO treatment for 1 h was 200 13 nM (n 7) and IC50 for the T394A mutant was 5.3 0.8 nM (n 4) (Fig Taken together, results from these three mutants (T394A, AT and ATT) suggest the Thr394 is the primary recognition site by GRKs, but another threonine at residue 383 that is closest located, is also required for complete desensitization of the MOR A, wild type MOR; B, a mutant MOR in which the last threonine (T394A) was substituted to alanine; C, a mutant MOR in which 2 serines and 5 threonines between residues 363 and 383 (AT) were substituted by alanines but Thr394 was unaltered; D, the effect of seven serine or threonine substitutions on agonist-induced desensitization is presented with the effect on wild type MOR (q, wild type MOR without pretreatment of DAMGO; E, wild type MOR with DAMGO pretreatment; , AT mutant receptor with DAMGO pretreatment) [3H]Naloxone [2H]Naloxone/DAMGO KH KL RH RL nM % Wild type Bmax 3.8 0.9 pmol/mg 2.9 0.7 326 25 69 2 31 2 Kd 0.9 0.2 nM T394A Bmax 3.5 0.5 pmol/mg 2.7 1.4 329 14 74 2 26 2 Kd 1.0 0.3 nM T/S363383A (AT) Bmax 4.3 0.3 pmol/mg 2.2 1.7 370 23 70 1 30 1 Kd 1.0 0.1 nM T/S363379A (ATT) Bmax 4.0 0.1 pmol/mg 3.2 0.2 383 97 71 2 29 2 Kd 1.0 0.1 nM E388393Q (EQ) Bmax 2.0 0.1 pmol/mg 2.9 1.8 431 215 73 2 27 2 Kd 2.5 0.9 nM FIG

activity with M-tropic Env, with a mean value that was greater than 50% of wild type CCR5 The M-tropic coreceptor activity of CXCR4-D187V could be inhibited by the addition of SDF-1, the ligand for CXCR4, and ALX40 4C, a pharmacologic inhibitor of CXCR4, to the fusion reaction, but not by AOP-RANTES, a CCR5-specific antagonist (Fig Structural Determinants of CXCR4-D187V M-tropic Coreceptor Activity--We have previously reported findings that implicate the involvement of the N terminus, ECL2, and ECL3 of CCR5 (33) and ECL1 and ECL2 of CXCR4 (34) in fusion coreceptor activity Since CXCR4-D187V was found to have the highest M-tropic coreceptor activity of the variants examined, this point mutation was introduced into a panel of chimeras containing ECL2 of CXCR4, including hybrids 4442, 2442, 2242, 2444, and 2244 3A, the chimeras 2444-D187V and 4442-D187V showed significant coreceptor activity with JRFL Fusion assay values with D187V inserted into 2442, 2242, and 2244 were higher than negative controls and wild type CXCR4 but were less than the other chimeras The ability of the D187V mutation to confer some M-tropic coreceptor activity in each CXCR4/2 chimera containing ECL2 of CXCR4 suggests that the segment of this receptor present in the 2242 chimera, which extends from tm4 to tm6, contains the motif(s) responsible for its fusogenic activity but does not exclude the contribution of other (extracellular) domains The T-tropic coreceptor activity of the chimeras containing D187V was similar to that previously described for the chimeras with the wild type sequences (34) The D187V mutation was introduced into this multispecific coreceptor to determine whether it would enhance its utilization by M-tropic Env The coreceptor activity of the 5444-D187V variant was not significantly different from that of the 5444 hybrid composed of wild type sequences (Fig CXCR4 D187V Also Confers Sensitivity to Infection with Pseudotyped Viruses Containing M-tropic Env--The coreceptor function of the CXCR4-D187 variants was tested in infection experiments to provide independent evidence of the acquisition of activity with the extended repertoire of Env glycoproteins The ability of CXCR4 and CCR5 ligands (SDF-1 and AOP-RANTES, respectively), a pharmacologic inhibitor of CXCR4 (ALX40 4C), and a monoclonal antibody to CD4 (number 19) to inhibit the utilization of CXCR4-D187V by T-tropic (IIIB) and Mtropic (JRFL) Env is shown in C Following optimization of the transfection efficiency, transfectants expressing varying levels of CXCR4, CCR5, CXCR4-D187V, and the 5444 chimera were prepared by using serial dilutions of the construct plasmid with compensatory amounts of vector plasmid as carrier Structural requirements for coreceptor activity of chimeras containing D187V in ECL2 of CXCR4 with U-tropic, T-tropic, and dual tropic Env Chimeric receptors composed of complementary regions of CXCR4 and CXCR2 and containing ECL2 (D187V) of CXCR4 were tested for M-tropic coreceptor activity with JRFL (A) and dual tropic and T-tropic coreceptor activity with 89.6 and IIIB, respectively (B) Cryptic M-tropic Activity of CXCR4 15011 tions containing 1.5, 0.30, 0.15, 0.03, 0.015, and 0.003 g of plasmid encoding wild type and variant coreceptors described above demonstrated decreasing levels of cell surface fluorescent staining with monoclonal antibodies, as is shown for CXCR4-D187V (Fig Parallel transfections used in Envmediated fusion assays failed to reveal significant alterations in coreceptor activity for wild type, mutant, and chimeric receptors over a broad range of expression, including when less than 5% of cells demonstrated levels of fluorescence greater than that of the negative control, as is shown for CXCR4D187V in Fig Analysis of chimeric receptors revealed that ECL2 of CXCR4 containing D187V was sufficient for inducing fusion with M-tropic Env glycoproteins These assays are semiquantitative, and the precise biologic significance of values intermediate between that of CCR5 and negative coreceptors, as observed with CXCR4D187V, is not clear It is noted, however, that the M-tropic coreceptor activity of CXCR4-D187V is of a similar magnitude to that of other fusogenic chemokine receptors, such as CCR3 and CCR8 (50) and that this variant coreceptor can be utilized both by Env from prototypic M- and T-tropic strains of HIV-1, unlike the activity reported for other wild type chemokine or orphan receptors (4, 1216, 50 54) Monolayers were transfected with the pcDNA3 vector (a) or with varying

B, CXCR2; C, KSHV-GPCR; D, CXCR1; E, D138V; F, D138Q The CXCR2 mutant D138Q, in which the same Asp was replaced with Gln, showed only a small increase of inositol phosphate turnover over untransfected NIH 3T3 cells (Fig At high concentrations, the CXCR2 mutant D138Q responded almost as well as the CXCR2, but the mutant showed a much lower affinity These functional results were confirmed by 125I-labeled IL-8 binding studies that showed a Kd of 1.2 10 9 M for the CXCR2 and a Kd greater than 2 10 8 M for the D138Q mutant All of these results are consistent with poor G protein coupling of the D138Q mutant In CXCR2-transfected cells, the Ca2 mobilization was transient and Ca2 concentrations quickly fell back to almost background levels, whereas Ca2 remained elevated over a prolonged time in D138Q-transfected cells Ca2 mobilization and actin polymerization could be completely blocked by pertussis toxin in CXCR1, CXCR2, and D138Q (data not shown) The inositol phosphate accumulation in cells transfected with CXCR2, KSHV-GPCR, and the D138V mutant is significantly higher than in untransfected cells or those transfected with CXCR1 or the D138Q mutant Actin polymerization is significantly higher in CXCR2-, CXCR1-, and D138Q-transfected cells compared with untransfected, KSHV-GPCR-, or D138V-transfected cells The more conservative D138Q mutant would not be expected to have this effect In contrast, the same point mutation, corresponding to the D138V in CXCR2, that exchanges the Asp for a Val in the CXCR1 (D134V-CXCR1) or continuous stimulation of the CXCR1 with IL-8, did not result in focus formation (Fig In contrast, continuous stimulation of the CXCR1 with human IL-8 or introducing the point mutation that exchanges the Asp for a Val into the CXCR1 receptor (D134V-CXCR1) did not result in transforming capacity (Fig In this study, we exchanged Asp138 of the DRY sequence in the CXCR2 with a Val (D138V), the corresponding amino acid in KSHV-GPCR, or with a Gln (D138Q), and investigated the functional consequences of these mutations In focus formation and soft agar growth assays in NIH 3T3 cells, the D138V mutant exhibited transforming potential similar to the KSHV-GPCR In agreement with these results were high levels of inositol phosphate accumulation in the D138V mutant and the KSHV-GPCR, indicating constitutive activity D138V and D138Q are point mutations of the CXCR2 in which Asp138 (GTA) is replaced by Val (GCA) or Gln (GAA) The mutant receptor D138V, in which the Asp of the DRY sequence in the second intracellular loop of the CXCR2 was exchanged for the corresponding hydrophobic Val in the KSHVGPCR, caused almost as many foci as the KSHV-GPCR In contrast, the same point mutation, corresponding to the D138V in CXCR2, that exchanges the Asp for a Val in the CXCR1 (D134V-CXCR1) or continuous stimulation of the CXCR1 with IL-8, did not result in focus formation (Fig 2018 CONSTITUTIVE SIGNALING OF MUTATED CXCR2 SIMILAR TO KSHV-GPCR FACS analysis indicated that surface expression of the CXCR1, CXCR2, and the D138V and D138Q mutants was similar, even a little higher for the D138Q mutant (data not shown), so that differences in the level of expression could not explain the varying behavior of these receptors Cells transfected with the CXCR2, the D138V mutant, or the KSHV-GPCR all formed colonies after 23 wk in culture (Fig Colonies of CXCR2-transfected cells tended to stay smaller than those of cells transfected with the KSHV-GPCR or the D138V mutant, but clearly grew in an anchorage-independent fashion, usually associated with the potential to metastasize (22) In contrast, accumulation of inositol phosphates in cells transfected with the CXCR2 mutant D138V (3.1-fold higher than found in untransfected NIH 3T3 cells) could not be blocked by either of FIGURE 2 The number of foci formed by cells transfected with CXCR2, KSHV-GPCR, and the D138V mutant are significantly higher than untransfected cells or those transfected with CXCR1 or the D138Q mutant A, Untransfected NIH 3T3 cells; B, CXCR2; C, KSHV-GPCR; D, CXCR1; E, D138V; F, D138Q In both assays, the KSHV-GPCR and the mutant D138V showed only a small response to IL-8 stimulation, consistent with the idea that these receptors exhibit constitutive activity independent of ligand (2), the KSHV-GPCR as well as D138V can be activated by IL-8 over constitutive levels, which could mean that additional stimulation might even enhance the functional activities of these receptors The inositol phosphate accumulation in cells transfected with CXCR2, KSHV-GPCR, and the D138V mutant is significantly higher than in untransfected cells or those transfected with CXCR1 or the D138Q mutant Addition of anti-CXCR2, anti-mouse-KC Abs, or pertussis toxin treatment led to significantly lower inositol phosphate accumulation in CXCR2transfected cells compared with KSHV-GPCR- or D138V-transfected cells Actin polymerization is significantly higher in CXCR2-, CXCR1-, and D138Q-transfected cells compared with untransfected, KSHV-GPCR-, or D138V-transfected cells Replacement of the Asp in the DRY sequence by the bulky hydrophobic Val in this location, as seen in the KSHV-GPCR and in our D138V mutant, presumably pulls this region into the plasma membrane Hence, the similarity in the signaling of the CXCR2 mutant D138V and the KSHV-GPCR supports the hypothesis that the gene of the KSHV-GPCR has been pirated from the CXCR2 
10212233	Mutants of the human platelet-activating factor receptor that fail to show any detectable ligand binding (N285I and K298stop) or coupling to a G-protein (D63N, D289A, and Y293A) were co-expressed with the WT receptor in Chinese hamster ovary and COS-7 cells In this context, N285I and K298stop mutant receptors inhibited 3HWEB2086 binding and surface expression For the hPAFR, the WT receptor was co-transfected with the substitution mutants N285I (37), D289A (37), Y293A (38), and D63N (39) and the deletion mutant receptor K298stop (38) The N285I (37) and K298stop (38) mutant receptors do not show any specific binding of PAF (a phospholipid) or the antagonist WEB2086 (a benzodiazepine) Flow Cytometry Studies--CHO and COS-7 cells co-transfected with c-myc-tagged hPAFR WT receptor and N285I or D63N constructions were harvested between 48 and 72 h after transfection, and 2.5 105 cells were subjected to flow cytometry analysis In contrast, the N285I mutant receptor was efficient at preventing WEB2086 binding to either whole cells or membrane preparations (Fig Co-expression of the N285I mutant with the WT receptor also caused a significant decrease of cell surface expression of both receptors (Fig In addition, it Modulation of hPAFR and CCR2b Functions 12549 is of interest to note that the cell surface expression of the co-expressed receptors was significantly lower (23 8%) than that of the WT (defined as 100%) or of the N285I (65 15%) mutant receptor expressed alone (Fig Confocal microscopy showed that the hemagglutinin-tagged WT and the c-myctagged N285I mutant receptors were efficiently expressed on the cell surface The N285I mutant receptors, however, were not as evenly distributed and seemed to aggregate The decreased cell surface expression was not due to an increased internalization rate of the co-transfected receptors because inhibitors of internalization failed to modify the distribution of WT N285I complexes No accumulation of receptors on the cell surface was observed by FACScan analysis (WT N285I untreated, 29 12%; NH4Cl, 31 1.8%; sucrose, 31 8%; dynamin K44A, 15 8%; the percentages are in relation to WT expressed alone after undergoing the same treatment and set at 100%), although these inhibitors have been shown to efficiently block the internalization of hPAFR (38) The influence of the K298stop mutant was comparable to N285I, and the extent of inhibition of expression and 3HWEB2086 binding was dependent on the amount of co-transfected mutant cDNA, even to membrane preparations (data not shown) The similar effects of these two mutants suggest a comparable conformational change induced by the N285I substitution and the deletion of the last 44 amino acids of the carboxyl terminus (K298stop) in the seventh transmembrane domain Evaluation of PAF affinity after co-expression of WT and N285I or K298stop receptors could not be done using 3H-WEB2086 because the level of specific binding was negligible

(1 g to 2 5 g) receptor-encoding cDNA Co-transfection of N285I and WT receptor cDNA generated a slightly lower maximal IP response than that seen with the WT alone (Fig A decrease (approximately 3-fold) was also observed when these two receptors were co-expressed in a 1:3 proportion of WT: N285I (Fig 1B) were all inversely proportional to the quantity of transfected N285I mutant cDNA However, PAF-induced IP accumulation was inhibited by WEB2086 in the same manner in cells expressing the WT alone (IC50 4.1 0.5 M) or in the presence of N285I (IC50 4.5 0.9 M ) mutant receptor (data not shown) Total IP was measured after a 1-min stimulation with the indicated PAF concentrations of COS-7 cells co-transfected with a 1:1 (B) and a 1:3 (C) ratio of the WT (300 ng in B and 150 ng in C) and either D63N, N285I, D289A, or Y293A mutant receptor-encoding cDNA or the pCDNA3 vector (150 ng in B and 450 ng in C) The resultant response, after co-transfection, is not necessarily the sum of the individual characteristics of each receptor because certain mutants induced a dominant-negative effect such as the inhibition of surface expression (N285I and K298stop) or generated a new phenotype such as constitutive activation (D63N) Selective modulation of binding characteristics for the agonist (D289A, D63N, and K311stop) and decreased cell surface expression (N285I and K298stop) have also been observed It is of interest to note that the cell surface expression of the co-expressed receptors was significantly lower (23 8%) than that of the WT (defined as 100%) or of the N285I (65 15%) mutant receptor expressed alone Interestingly, at a 1:1 ratio of WT:N285I, there was only a partial loss of surface receptor protein expression (23 8%, residual expression), but WEB2086 binding was almost completely inhibited (3 1%, residual binding) Modulation of hPAFR and CCR2b Functions 12552 existence of cell surface receptors whose capacity of binding WEB2086 had been altered by the co-expression of the N285I mutant Receptor expression, binding capacity, and IP responses were all inversely proportional to the quantity of mutant cDNA (N285I and K311stop) co-transfected with the WT of hPAFR and CCR2b This is supported by: 1) the fact that binding curves were all uniphasic for co-expressed receptors with different affinities, 2) a shift in affinity for MCP-1 was observed with the co-expression of the hCCR2 and K311stop mutant, and 3) the efficiency of the N285I mutant in inhibiting WEB2086 binding to hPAFR We confirmed that these findings could be extended to other GPCRs by showing that co-expression of the WT C-C chemokine receptor 2b with a carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant (K311stop), resulted in a decreased affinity and responsiveness to MCP-1 We also co-expressed the WT hCCR2b and a carboxyl terminus deletion mutant (K311stop), which did not show any detectable 125I-MCP-1 binding capacity, to evaluate whether our observations for the hPAFR could be extended to another member of the GPCR family The carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant K311stop was constructed by PCR using the CCR2-FWD primer and oligonucleotide 5 -CGGGGTACCTCGAGTCGCGACTACTCCCCRACRAACGCGTAGATGATGGG-3 , and the PCR product was subcloned into BamHI-Acc65I of pJ3M The Effect of the Co-transfection of hCCR2b and K311stop on IP Production and MCP-1 Binding--To verify whether our observations with the hPAFR could apply to another GPCR, we performed experiments with the hCCR2b receptor A modification in the binding characteristics and response was seen for this receptor when co-transfected with the deletion mutant receptor K311stop (Fig Selective modulation of binding characteristics for the agonist (D289A, D63N, and K311stop) and decreased cell surface expression (N285I and K298stop) have also been observed Receptor expression, binding capacity, and IP responses were all inversely proportional to the quantity of mutant cDNA (N285I and K311stop) co-transfected with the WT of hPAFR and CCR2b This is supported by: 1) the fact that binding curves were all uniphasic for co-expressed receptors with different affinities, 2) a shift in affinity for MCP-1 was observed with the co-expression of the hCCR2 and K311stop mutant, and 3) the efficiency of the N285I mutant in inhibiting WEB2086 binding to hPAFR 125I-MCP-1 binding was measured as indicated under "Materials and Methods" on CHO cells that were transiently co-transfected with the WT (1 g) and K311stop mutant receptorencoding cDNAs (1 g) Total IPs were measured after a 30-min stimulation with the indicated MCP-1 concentrations of COS-7 cells co-transfected with 150 ng of the Gprotein subunit G 14 cDNA and either hCCR2b WT or K311stop receptor cDNA, alone (150 ng) or in combination (1:1 ratio (150 ng WT:150 ng K311stop) or 1:3 ratio (150 ng WT:450 ng K311stop)) Other mutant receptors (C90A, C90S, C173A, and C173S) with altered cell surface expression and binding characteristics (41) did not modulate the WT receptor phenotype (data not shown) Mutants of the human platelet-activating factor receptor that fail to show any detectable ligand binding (N285I and K298stop) or coupling to a G-protein (D63N, D289A, and Y293A) were co-expressed with the WT receptor in Chinese hamster ovary and COS-7 cells For the hPAFR, the WT receptor was co-transfected with the substitution mutants N285I (37), D289A (37), Y293A (38), and D63N (39) and the deletion mutant receptor K298stop (38) However, the substitution Y293A, in the same motif, did not significantly affect these properties (38) Affinity was not affected by co-expression of the D63N, D289A, or Y293A mutant receptors when compared with cells expressing only the WT (Fig Co-expression of the WT and Y293A receptors resulted in an apparent affinity very similar to the one displayed by the WT alone The numbers of cell surface receptors for the co-expressed WT D289A and WT Y293A were equivalent to the WT

D63N, N285I, D289A, or Y293A mutant receptor-encoding cDNA or the pCDNA3 vector (150 ng in B and 450 ng in C) The uncoupled mutant receptor Y293A had no effect on WT distribution, binding characteristics, or response Other mutant receptors (C90A, C90S, C173A, and C173S) with altered cell surface expression and binding characteristics (41) did not modulate the WT receptor phenotype (data not shown) Other mutant receptors (C90A, C90S, C173A, and C173S) with altered cell surface expression and binding characteristics (41) did not modulate the WT receptor phenotype (data not shown) Mutants of the human platelet-activating factor receptor that fail to show any detectable ligand binding (N285I and K298stop) or coupling to a G-protein (D63N, D289A, and Y293A) were co-expressed with

(N285I and K298stop) have also been observed Cells were plated in 30-mm dishes (2.0 105 COS-7 cells/dish or 3.0 105 CHO cells/dish) and transiently transfected with the constructions encoding WT and mutant receptors or dynamin Ia K44A (a kind gift from M No accumulation of receptors on the cell surface was observed by FACScan analysis (WT N285I untreated, 29 12%; NH4Cl, 31 1.8%; sucrose, 31 8%;

co-expressed with the WT receptor in Chinese hamster ovary and COS-7 cells Co-transfection with D63N resulted in a constitutively active receptor phenotype Platelet-activating factor-induced inositol phosphate production in cells transfected with a 1:1 ratio of WT:D63N was higher than with the WT cDNA alone but was abolished with a 1:3 ratio For the hPAFR, the WT receptor was co-transfected with the substitution mutants N285I (37), D289A (37), Y293A (38), and D63N (39) and the deletion mutant receptor K298stop (38) Substitutions of a highly conserved aspartate in the second transmembrane domain (D63N) or in the conserved motif D/NPXXY of the seventh transmembrane domain (D289A) lead to a receptor with reduced internalization capacity but with an increased affinity for PAF (3739) Flow Cytometry Studies--CHO and COS-7 cells co-transfected with c-myc-tagged hPAFR WT receptor and N285I or D63N constructions were harvested between 48 and 72 h after transfection, and 2.5 105 cells were subjected to flow cytometry analysis Western Blot--COS-7 cells co-transfected with WT and pCDNA3 (WT) or WT and D63N (WT D63N) in a 1:3 ratio were cultivated as described above and lysed at 4 C for 30 min in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM Na3V04, 1 mM Na2P207, 1 mM NaF, and 10 mg/ml of the protease inhibitors aprotinin and leupeptin Affinity was not affected by co-expression of the D63N, D289A, or Y293A mutant receptors when compared with cells expressing only the WT (Fig For instance, the D63N mutant has an 6.7-fold higher affinity for PAF than the WT receptor when expressed individually (39), but after co-expression with the WT receptor, the apparent affinity was only 1.9-fold higher than that of the WT alone (Table I) When the WT was co-expressed with D63N in a 1:1 proportion, the cell surface receptor expression was slightly reduced ( 25%) (Table I), but no further reduction was seen at a 1:3 proportion of WT:D63N in FACScan analysis (data not shown) Receptor PAF 3H-WEB2086 3H-WEB2086 Ki Ki Bmax WT 23.4 1.3 28.2 1.6 788,400 148,650 WT D63N 12.5 0.6 26.9

cells (1:3 proportion of WT:D63N), there was no augmentation of IP levels after a stimulation, even with 1 M PAF (Fig Binding was measured on CHO cells that were transiently co-transfected with the WT (1 g) and either the D63N, D289A, or Y293A mutant receptor-encoding cDNA (1 g) Total IP was measured after a 1-min stimulation with the indicated PAF concentrations of COS-7 cells co-transfected with a 1:1 (B) and a 1:3 (C) ratio of the WT (300 ng in B and 150 ng in C) and either D63N, N285I, D289A, or Y293A mutant receptor-encoding cDNA or the pCDNA3 vector (150 ng in B and 450 ng in C) The co-transfection of WT D63N also led to a constitutive increase of phosphotyrosine content as compared with WTtransfected cells (Fig When the blots were significantly underexposed, a major phosphorylated band was found at approximately 190 kDa in the WT D63N lysate The increase in cellular phosphotyrosine levels could also directly or indirectly participate in the basal IP production because genistein (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor) significantly decreased IP accumulation in the cells co-expressing the WT D63N (1:3) complex (Fig The resultant response, after co-transfection, is not necessarily the sum of the individual characteristics of each receptor because certain mutants induced a dominant-negative effect such as the inhibition of surface expression (N285I and K298stop) or generated a new phenotype such as constitutive activation (D63N) Selective modulation of binding characteristics for the agonist (D289A, D63N, and K311stop) and decreased cell surface expression (N285I and K298stop) have also been observed Basal tyrosine kinase activity in cells co-expressing the WT and D63N mutant hPAFRs and the impact on IP accumulation A, comparative analysis of phosphotyrosine levels in COS-7 cells co-expressing 1:3 WT:D63N or the WT receptor (1:3 WT:pCDNA3) C, evaluation of the effect of tyrosine phosphorylation on basal IP accumulation in COS-7 cells co-expressing the WT and D63N mutant receptors (1:3 WT:D63N) Our data also showed that different ratios of D63N:WT modulate the phenotype of the complex We also demonstrate that co-expression of an uncoupled mutant (D63N) with the WT receptor could lead to an apparent constitutively active phenotype highly dependent on receptor: mutant ratio Interestingly, even though D63N does not seem 2 C It is therefore conceivable that oligomerization between the WT and D63N receptors may result in a complex that possesses both the capacity for Gprotein coupling and certain characteristics of constitutively active receptors The fact that the 1:3 WT:D63N was unresponsive to PAF could be due to the fact that all receptor complexes are already in an active conformation This constitutive activation would also result in a certain quantity of receptors being desensitized and internalized, which may also explain the fact that the levels of basal IP accumulation (1:3 WT:D63N) are lower than if one stimulates a population of WT receptors, of which none are desensitized The combination of WT and D63N also resulted in an increase in tyrosine phosphoproteins as compared with cells transfected only with WT We are now pursuing the identification of the proteins that were differentially phosphorylated in the presence of D63N to compare the patterns with ligand-induced phosphorylation Mutants of the human platelet-activating factor receptor that fail to show any detectable ligand binding (N285I and K298stop) or coupling to a G-protein (D63N, D289A, and Y293A) were co-expressed with the WT receptor in Chinese hamster ovary and COS-7 cells For the hPAFR, the WT receptor was co-transfected with the substitution mutants N285I (37), D289A (37), Y293A (38), and D63N (39) and the deletion mutant receptor K298stop (38) Substitutions of a highly conserved aspartate in the second transmembrane domain (D63N) or in the conserved motif D/NPXXY of the seventh

Y293A mutant receptors when compared with cells expressing only the WT (Fig Similar results were obtained with D289A, which displays a 2.8-fold higher affinity than the WT when expressed alone (37) and an apparent increase in affinity of 1.3-fold over the WT when these two receptors are co-expressed The numbers of cell surface receptors for the co-expressed WT D289A and WT Y293A were equivalent

Total IP was measured after a 1-min stimulation with the indicated PAF concentrations of COS-7 cells co-transfected with a 1:1 (B) and a 1:3 (C) ratio of the WT (300 ng in B and 150 ng in C) and

10385703	To investigate the role played by highly conserved residues in determining the active and inactive states of the human OTR, the N57A, D85A and D136A, D136Q, and R137A mutations were introduced into the WT OTR receptor by sitedirected mutagenesis The cells transfected with the N57A, D136A, and D136Q mutants did not show any specific binding when probed in saturation binding assays with labeled agonists ([3H]OT and [3H]AVP) or antagonists ([125I]OTA); furthermore, they were completely unresponsive when assayed for InsP production upon stimulation with high doses of OT and AVP (10 5 M; data not shown) Mutation of the conserved arginine of the glutamate/aspartate-arginine-tyrosine motif located in the second intracellular domain gave rise to the first known constitutively active oxytocin receptor (R137A), whereas mutation of the aspartic acid located in the second transmembrane domain led to an inactive receptor (D85A) A comparative analysis of the molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories of the wild-type (WT) OTR as well as of the R137A and D85A mutants was performed This approach led to the discovery of the activating mutation R137A and the inactivating mutation D85A To investigate the role played by highly conserved residues in determining the active and inactive states of the human OTR, the N57A, D85A and D136A, D136Q, and R137A mutations were introduced into the WT OTR receptor by sitedirected mutagenesis On the contrary, the R137A and the D85A mutants were sorted to the plasma membrane, as indicated by binding analysis of intact cells; however, we had to increase the amount of specific DNA transfected (plasmid with a subcloned receptor cDNA) by a factor of 10 to achieve a level of expression similar to that of the WT Under these conditions, the Bmax values for the WT and the R137A mutant, as measured by means of [3H]OT saturation experiments with intact cells, were 426,300 157,400 (n 3) and 435,000 50,140 (n 3) sites/cell, respectively Coupling Properties of R137A (Constitutively Active) and D85A (Inactive) Mutants To determine the coupling properties of the R137A and D85A mutants, the basal production of total InsP was measured in transiently transfected COS7 cells expressing similar levels of WT or mutant OTRs (0.40.5 pmol/mg of proteins) 2A, our data indicate that the R137A induced a significant increase in the basal production of total InsP; if the basal level of total InsP in mock-transfected cells is taken as 100%, this increase was estimated to be 145% (n 5, p .001) Basal and stimulated activation of WT, R137A, and D85A OTR receptors WT, R137A, and D85A receptors were transiently expressed in COS7 cells and their coupling to Gq/G11 was evaluated by measuring the accumulation of total InsP over a period of 15 min Graph shows the mean values of five different experiments; in each experiment, performed in triplicate, the basal InsP production of the WT and R137A mutant was expressed as the percentage of increase over that of mock-transfected cells (taken as 100%) These data indicate that we obtained one constitutively active mutant (R137A) that is still responsive to OT, and one that is unable to stimulate phospholipase C and is functionally inactive (D85A) To evaluate whether variations of transfection efficiency between the WT and the R137A mutant may have influenced our findings, we subcloned the WT OTR and the constitutively active R137A mutant into the multicloning site of the pIRES-EGFP vector (Clontech) The transfection of our constructs (WT-OTRpIRES and R137A-pIRES) led to the coexpression of the receptor and EGFP in the same cells, thus allowing transient transfection efficiency to be evaluated by means of FACS analysis These amounts of DNA, 0.75 g of WTOTR-pIRES, and 7.5 g R137A-pIRES, are approximately 10 times more than that used with our constructs in the pRK5 vector (0.09 and 0.9 g for the WT and R137A, respectively); although both plasmids use a cytomegalovirus promoter, they have different enhancer, synthetic-splicing, and polyadenilation signals, and these differences may explain their different ability to drive heterologous protein expression Figure 3, B and C, shows the results of one of two experiments in which we used flow cytometry to measured the percentage of cells transfected with WT-OTR-pIRES and R137A-pIRES At this level of expression, the basal activity of the R137A and WT OTR had increased to 177% (n 2) and 116% (n 2) that of the mock-transfected cells These data confirm that the R137A mutant is characterized by a basal activity higher than that of the wild-type receptor To better analyze the coupling properties of the R137A mutant, we drew the dose-response curves of total InsP accumulation upon agonist stimulation 4A, R137A was able to stimulate phospholipase C in a dosedependent manner with a calculated EC50 for OT of 57.4 24.4 nM (n 3); this value differs by approximately a factor 10 from that of the WT receptor expressed in the same cells (4.8 0.8 nM; n 3) Finally, the inverse agonist properties of the specific peptidic antagonist OTA were assayed in cells transfected with the R137A mutant B, FACS profiles of COS7 cells transfected with 0.75 and 7.5 g of WT-OTR-pIRES and R137A-pIRES DNA C, basal InsP production of cells transfected with 0.75 and 7.5 g of WT-OTR-pIRES and R137A-pIRES DNA In this experiment, performed in triplicate, the basal InsP production of the WT and R137A mutant was expressed as the percentage of increase over that of mock-transfected cells (taken as 100%) level of receptor expression of the WT and R137A mutant, we performed a set of experiments in which the number of receptors expressed on the cell surface was measured by means of [3H]OT saturation binding on intact cells 5, our data indicate a linear correlation between the increase in cell surface receptors and basal InsP production for both the WT and the R137A mutant OTRs Even though we were unable to reach very high levels of expression with the R137A mutant, these data confirm that at comparable level of expression, the R137A produced more InsP than the WT receptor Binding Properties of Constitutively Active R137A Mutant Cell homogenates were used to obtain a more detailed pharmacological characterization of the R137A mutant When assayed with the tritiated agonist [3H]OT, no significant difference in OT affinity between the WT (0.46 0.047 nM; n 5) and the R137A mutant (1.2 0.81 nM; n 3) was observed in saturation experiments Similarly, no changes were found when AVP affinity was measured by means of [3H]OT competitive binding (1.65 0.49 nM; n 3 and 2.5 0.42 nM; n 3 for the WT and R137A, respectively) However, the R137A mutant showed a marked reduction (20-fold) in the affinity of the specific cyclic peptidic antagonist OTA, as determined in saturation experiments (0.095 0.033 nM, n 5; and 1.95 0.81 nM, n 4 for the WT and R137A, respectively) We also performed [3H]OT saturation binding experiments in the presence and absence of GTP S to compare the coupling state of R137A with that of the WT receptor On the contrary, in the R137A mutant, no significant change in OT affinity was detected in the presence of GTP S These findings support the evidence that the R137A mutant is characterized by (a) particular precoupling state(s) that is/are quite different from that of the WT receptor and that determine(s) its increased basal activity Computer Simulation of WT and R137A OTRs 7, different interaction patterns involving polar and charged amino acids characterize the average minimized structures of the WT and R137A mutant OTRs Agonist and inverse agonist properties of OT and OTA in the WT OTR and R137A mutant A, effects of increasing concentrations of OT; in these experiments, we calculated an EC50 value of 1.32 0.13 nM and 66.67 1.20 nM for the WT OTR and the R137A mutant, respectively B, effects of increasing concentrations of the specific antagonist OTA; in this experiment, the IC50 value for R137A was 0.1 0.71 pM WT and R137A basal activities as a function of receptor expression levels WT and R137A receptors were transiently expressed at variable levels in COS7 cells by transfecting increasing amounts of specific plasmid cDNA; basal InsP production and [3H]OT binding were determined as described in Materials and Methods A rearrangement of the interaction patterns involving the "polar pocket" amino acids occurs in the constitutively active R137A mutant structure (Fig The differences in the interaction patterns of the polar pocket amino acids in the WT and R137A mutant are associated with differences in the arrangement of helices and loops (Figs In particular, one of the structural peculiarity of the R137A mutant is the detachment of helices 4 and 5 and the approaching of the cytosolic end of helix 4 to that of helix 2 (Fig Effect of GTP S treatment on [3H]OT affinity in the WT and R137A Membrane from COS7 cells expressing the WT or the R137A mutant receptors were prepared and preincubated for 10 min in the presence of 100 mM GTP S; [3H]OT saturation experiments were then performed as described in Materials and Methods Similar to the R137A active mutant, the OT-bound OTR structure is characterized by the approaching of the cytosolic ends of helices 2 and 4, as compared with WT OTR (Fig Similar to the constitutively active structure R137A, the motions of helices 3, 4, 5, and 6 promote the release of the majority of the salt bridge interactions and of the other weaker interactions connecting i1 and i2 with i3 and the cytosolic extension of helix 7 in the free form of WT OTR (Fig By targeting the highly conserved amino acids N57 (helix 1), D85 (helix 2), D136 (helix 3), and R137 (helix 3), we found that mutation of the arginine of the E/DRY sequence into alanine (R137A) leads to a form of the OTR characterized by an increased basal activity a, cylinder representation of the seven helices of WT OTR superimposed on the structures of the R137A active mutant (top left), the OT-D85A complex (bottom left), and the OT-WT OTR complex (bottom right) Mutation R137A triggers rigid body motions that involve the whole helix bundle, leading to the opening of a cytosolic site involving i2, the cytosolic extension of helix 5 and i3 (Fig Our results suggest that, although differently triggered, the motion of the helices in the OT-OTR complexes and in the R137A active mutant leads to the opening of a cytosolic crevice in between i2 and i3 These differences in receptor/G protein recognition may be responsible for the particular coupling properties of the R137A mutant Second, several differences between the WT and the R137A active mutant involve the arrangement of the extracellular domains, including the extracellular ends of the helix bundle In this respect, it is worth noting that, unlike the great majority of constitutively active receptor mutants, the constitutively active R137A does not show any measurable increase in agonist affinity We proposed a possible docking of the peptide into the receptor that allowed us to describe the similarities and the differences between a mutation-induced and an agonist-induced active state at the molecular level; furthermore, the use of the R137A mutant made it possible to demonstrate that the specific antagonist OTA, one of the most extensively used analogs for characterizing the pharmacological and functional aspects of human OTR, behaves as an inverse agonist To investigate the role played by highly conserved residues in determining the active and inactive states of the human OTR, the N57A, D85A and D136A, D136Q, and R137A mutations were introduced into the WT OTR receptor by sitedirected mutagenesis The cells transfected with the N57A, D136A, and D136Q mutants did not show any specific binding when probed in saturation binding assays with labeled agonists ([3H]OT and [3H]AVP) or antagonists ([125I]OTA); furthermore, they were completely unresponsive when assayed for InsP production upon stimulation with high doses of OT and AVP (10 5 M; data not shown) To investigate the role played by highly conserved residues in determining the active and inactive states of the human OTR, the N57A, D85A and D136A, D136Q, and R137A mutations were introduced into the WT OTR receptor by sitedirected mutagenesis The cells transfected with the N57A, D136A, and D136Q mutants did not show any specific binding when probed in saturation binding assays with labeled agonists ([3H]OT and [3H]AVP) or antagonists ([125I]OTA); furthermore, they were completely unresponsive when assayed for InsP production upon stimulation with high doses of OT and AVP (10 5 M; data not shown) Mutation of the conserved arginine of the glutamate/aspartate-arginine-tyrosine motif located in the second intracellular domain gave rise to the first known constitutively active oxytocin receptor (R137A), whereas mutation of the aspartic acid located in the second transmembrane domain led to an inactive receptor (D85A) The results suggest that, although differently triggered, the activation process induced by the agonist and the activating mutation are characterized by the opening of a solvent exposed site formed by the 2nd intracellular loop, the cytosolic extension of helix 5, and the 3rd intracellular loop; on the contrary, the D85A mutation prevents oxytocin from triggering the opening of a cytosolic site A comparative analysis of the molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories of the wild-type (WT) OTR as well as of the R137A and D85A mutants was performed This approach led to the discovery of the activating mutation R137A and the inactivating mutation D85A To compare constitutive and agonist-induced activation, MD of the OT-bound forms of the WT OTR, as well as of the D85A mutant were also simulated The input structure of the OT-D85A complex was obtained by mutating D85 in the selected input structure of the OT-bound WT OTR To investigate the role played by highly conserved residues in determining the active and inactive states of the human OTR, the N57A, D85A and D136A, D136Q, and R137A mutations were introduced into the WT OTR receptor by sitedirected mutagenesis On the contrary, the R137A and the D85A mutants were sorted to the plasma membrane, as indicated by binding analysis of intact cells; however, we had to increase the amount of specific DNA transfected (plasmid with a subcloned receptor cDNA) by a factor of 10 to achieve a level of expression similar to that of the WT In the case of the D85A mutant, the level of expression was determined by means of [3H]AVP homologous competition because no specific binding was detected when [3H]OT was used in saturation and competition experiments Coupling Properties of R137A (Constitutively Active) and D85A (Inactive) Mutants To determine the coupling properties of the R137A and D85A mutants, the basal production of total InsP was measured in transiently transfected COS7 cells expressing similar levels of WT or mutant OTRs (0.40.5 pmol/mg of proteins) Basal and stimulated activation of WT, R137A, and D85A OTR receptors WT, R137A, and D85A receptors were transiently expressed in COS7 cells and their coupling to Gq/G11 was evaluated by measuring the accumulation of total InsP over a period of 15 min Constitutive and Agonist-Induced Activation of Human OTR 217 whereas no detectable increase in InsP production was observed in the D85A mutant under basal or stimulated conditions Because the D85A mutant retained a measurable affinity for AVP, we also checked InsP production after treatment with 10 5 M AVP; once again, no detectable variation in InsP accumulation was detected (not shown) These data indicate that we obtained one constitutively active mutant (R137A) that is still responsive to OT, and one that is unable to stimulate phospholipase C and is functionally inactive (D85A) Computer Simulation of WT and D85A OT/OTR Complexes To investigate the structural and dynamic features of the agonist-induced active states of OTR, OT was docked into the input structures of the WT OTR and of the agonistunactivatable D85A mutant Constitutive and Agonist-Induced Activation of Human OTR 221 D85A mutant differ from those in the corresponding complex with the WT receptor (Table 1 and Fig The OT-D85A complex is also characterized by the attractive effect exerted by D136 on R137 that contributes toward constraining the motion of this conserved arginine One important consequence is that OT is no longer capable of triggering the opening of the solvent-exposed site in the cytosolic domains of the D85A mutant (Figs a, cylinder representation of the seven helices of WT OTR superimposed on the structures of the R137A active mutant (top left), the OT-D85A complex (bottom left), and the OT-WT OTR complex (bottom right) Hormone in the OT-WT OTR and in OT-D85A complexes is represented by liquorices and is colored by atom types Agonist binding sites in the OT-bound forms of the WT OTR (top) and the D85A mutant (bottom) Top and bottom right views, details of the interactions of OT with the WT OTR (top) and the D85A mutant (bottom) In agreement with this hypothesis, the experimental results show that the D85A mutant is completely uncoupled 
10652295	Using an Asp130 3 Ala 2-G s fusion protein, we found that the removal of this acidic residue did not ablate the pHdependent increase in basal activity (Fig It was not possible to study agonist dependent conformational changes in the Asp130 3 Ala, Glu122 3 Ala, or Glu268 3 Ala receptor mutants in rhodopsin, Glu134 3 Gln) results in constitutive activation as assessed by the ability of opsin (rhodopsin without retinal) to induce GTP S binding by transducin (13) In addition, electron paramagnetic resonance analyses of this Glu134 3 Gln mutant showed that the dark state of this mutant shares conformational similarities with the photoactivated conformations of wild type rhodopsin (25) The KI of the low affinity site for the E122A fusion protein was significantly higher than that of the wild type and the other mutant fusion proteins 2-G S KD KI(low) KI(high) %Rhigh EC50 nM nM nM nM Wild type 0.36 0.3 124 19 3.0 1.3 42.5 7.5 12 4 D130A 1.3 0.1 42 12 1.8 0.8 45.7 4.2 17 4 E268A 1.2 0.3 70 22 1.5 0.5 49.6 4.1 28 2 E122A 1.5 0.2 712 27 5.5 0.6 42.1 1.3 19 9 Effect of pH on 2AR Activation 3126 ity by acid pH is not solely due to proton uptake by the acidic residue in the highly conserved E/DRY sequence at the cytoplasmic face of TM 3 All values represent the average of three experiments done in duplicate, except for E268A, which is the average of two experiments done in duplicate, the values for which are 18.6 and 15.9% at pH 8 and 54.4 and 52.3% at pH 6.5 All other values represent the average of three independent experiments and are reported with S.E., except for the EC50 calculation of the E268A fusion protein, which is the average of two experiments 2-G S KD KI(low) KI(high) %Rhigh EC50 nM nM nM nM Wild type 0.36 0.3 124 19 3.0 1.3 42.5 7.5 12 4 D130A 1.3 0.1 42 12 1.8 0.8 45.7 4.2 17 4 E268A 1.2 0.3 70 22 1.5 0.5 49.6 4.1 28 2 E122A 1.5 0.2 712 27 5.5 0.6 42.1 1.3 19 9 Effect of pH on 2AR Activation 3126 ity by acid pH is not solely due to proton uptake by the acidic residue in the highly conserved E/DRY sequence at the cytoplasmic face of TM 3

impaired PAF binding, indicating that these six residues may be involved in direct or indirect physical interactions with PAF Mutants of H188A, H248A, and Q276A were selected, because PAF binding affinities of these mutants were much lower than those of others In our experiments, the equilibrium might be shifted to R* in high affinity mutants (N100A, T101A, and S104A), and to R in low affinity mutants (H188A, H248A, and Q276A), compared with that in the wild type Mutants in TM II (N58A, D63A), TM III (N100A, T101A, S104A) and TM VII (D289A) displayed higher PAF-binding affinities than seen with the wild-type receptor An N100A mutant with the highest affinity was constitutively active and was responsive to lyso-PAF, an inactive derivative of PAF PAF preferentially bound to some mutants such as N58A, D63A, T69A, N100A, T101A, S104A, and D289A (with ratios over 1.40) in which substituted residues mainly cluster in TM II and III The specific PAF binding per FLAG expression revealed that FLAG-tagged mutants showed binding characteristics similar to those of the corresponding nontagged mutants; those of N58A, D63A, N100A, T101A, S104A, T112A, and D289A mutants were higher than that of the tagged wild type, whereas those of H188A, H248A, H249A, Q252A, Q276A, and T278A were lower Consequently, experiments with both types of the receptors identified six mutants (N58A, D63A, N100A, T101A, S104A, and D289A) as high affinity mutants and the other six mutants (H188A, H248A, H249A, Q252A, Q276A, and T278A) as low affinity ones Characterization of Ligand-binding Properties of

active, the effects of antagonist WEB 2086 on basal activities in arachidonate release, inositol phosphate (IPs) production, and adenylyl cyclase inhibition were examined (Fig Micromolar concentrations of WEB 2086 greatly reduced the basal arachidonate release in the N100A transformant, but not in the wild type (Fig The radioactivity of IPs (IP1 IP2 IP3) in the N100A transformant was five times as large as that in the wild-type transformant This phenomenon was also observed in COS-7 cells transfected with the N100A mutant but not with the wild-type receptor (data not shown) Further, IPs production decreased slightly but significantly after a 10-min exposure to WEB 2086 in the N100A transformant (Fig WEB 2086 augmented forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation in the N100A but not in the wildtype transformant, indicating that adenylyl cyclase was inhibited in the steady state in the N100A transformant, and this inhibition was released by WEB 2086 (Fig Thus, the N100A mutant proved to be a constitutively active receptor In all panels, the following receptors were studied: wild type; N100A; T101A; S104A; H188A; H248A; and Q276A Mutations of N58A, D63A, N100A, T101A, S104A, and D289A generated high affinity mutants, as determined both by the binding ratio and the specific PAF binding per FLAG expression (data not shown) Mutants of N100A, T101A, and S104A were chosen for further analysis, because PAF binding affinities of these mutants were much higher than that of D289A and the expression levels of the receptors were more constant than those of N58A and D63A One of the highest affinity mutants, N100A, was constitutively active and was responsive to lyso-PAF (Figs In our experiments, the equilibrium might be shifted to R* in high affinity mutants (N100A, T101A, and S104A), and to R in low affinity mutants (H188A, H248A, and Q276A), compared with that in the wild type In the N100A mutant, the equilibrium might be overshifted to R* enough to generate a constitutive activation Constitutive activation in signal transduction via the N100A mutant receptor The effects of antagonist WEB 2086 on basal cellular activities were examined in the wild type (open columns) and the N100A mutant (closed columns) expressed in CHO cells The effects of WEB 2086 were significant in the N100A transformant (*, p 0.06; **, p 0.02; ***, p 0.01; two-tailed, unpaired

9305937	Rescue of Functional Interactions between the 2A-Adrenoreceptor and Acylation-resistant Forms of Gi1 by Expressing the Proteins from Chimeric Open Reading Frames* (Received for publication, June 16, 1997) Alan Wise and Graeme Milligan From the Molecular Pharmacology Group, Division of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute of Biomedical and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Scotland, United Kingdom Co-expression of the 2A-adrenoreceptor with a pertussis toxin-resistant (C351G), but not with an also palmitoylation-resistant (C3S/C351G), form of the subunit of Gi1 resulted in agonist-induced, pertussis toxinindependent, GTP hydrolysis Construction and expression of a chimeric fusion protein between the receptor and C351G Gi1 generated a membrane protein in which the G protein element was activated by receptor agonist An equivalent fusion protein containing C3S/C351G Gi1 rescued the ability of receptor agonist to activate this mutant Fusion proteins of a palmitoylation-resistant (C442A) 2A-adrenoreceptor and either C351G or C3S/ C351G Gi1 also responded effectively to agonist Myristoylation resistant (G2A/C351G) and combined acylation-resistant (G2A/C3S/C351G) mutants of Gi1 are cytosolic proteins Construction of the 2A-Adrenoreceptor-C351G Gi1 Fusion Constructs--A pertussis toxin-resistant C351G form of rat Gi1 was generated (20) and linked to the porcine 2A-adrenoreceptor (22) The rat C351G Gi1 cDNA contains two NcoI sites, one straddling the ATG start codon and the other 268 bp downstream from this This 268-bp fragment was removed from C351G Gi1 in pBluescript by digestion with NcoI, and the remaining C351G Gi1 pBluescript cDNA was religated The 268-bp fragment was then inserted between the NcoI sites at the 3 -end of the 2A-adrenoreceptor ORF and at the 5 -end of the C351G Gi1 ORF This resulted in production of an in-frame construct whereby the 3 -end of the 2A-adrenoreceptor ORF was exactly adjacent to the 5 -end of the C351G Gi1 ORF A C351G mutation was introduced into Gi1 to render this protein insensitive to pertussis toxin (20) Co-expression of C3S/C351G Gi1 and the 2A-adrenoreceptor failed to allow UK14304 stimulation of the GTPase activity of this mutated G protein (Fig Co-expression of these forms of Gi1 , which also contained the C351G mutation with the 2A-adrenoreceptor, did not result in UK14304 stimulation of high affinity GTPase activity (21) as they were virtually entirely cytosolic (data not shown, but see Ref The open reading frames of each of C351G Gi1 , C3S/C351G Gi1 , G2A/C351G Gi1 , and G2A/C3S/C351G Gi1 were fused in-frame to the wild-type 2A-adrenoreceptor cDNA to create chimeric fusion proteins that contained the entire G protein subunit sequence downstream

activity was assessed following co-expression of the 2A-adrenoreceptor and C351G Gi1 (columns 1 and 2) or C3S/C351G Gi1 (columns 3 and 4) in COS-7 cells, pertussis toxin treatment, and membrane preparation as described under "Experimental Procedures." 2A-Adrenoreceptor-Gi1 Fusion Proteins 24674 Expression of each of these 2A-adrenoreceptor-C351G Gi1 constructs in COS-7 cells resulted in high levels of membrane expression of the receptor binding site (some 1525 pmol/mg protein in individual transfections) as measured by the specific binding of the highly selective and high affinity 2-antagonist [3H]RS-79948 197 (23) Membranes of cells expressing the 2A-adrenoreceptorC351G Gi1 fusion protein were able to support concentrationdependent stimulation of pertussis toxin-insensitive high affinity GTPase activity upon addition of UK14304 (EC50 2.3 0.3 10 7 M) (Fig In contrast to the lack of functional interactions between co-expressed but independent 2A-adrenoreceptor and

terminus of the 2A-adrenoreceptor resulted in the receptor C-terminal amino acid (valine) being converted to alanine and maintenance of the methionine, which normally functions as initiator in Gi1 Co-expression of the 1 2 complex with the wild-type 2Aadrenoreceptor-C351G Gi1 fusion protein resulted in substantially greater maximal stimulation of GTPase activity by UK14304 than achieved without excess 1 2 (Fig Additional expression of 1 2 also increased the maximal GTPase activity in response to UK14304 of each of the G2A/C351G, C3S/C351G, and G2A/C3S/C351G forms of Gi1 constrained in fusion

Introduction of the NcoI site at the 3'-end of the ORF resulted in the C-terminal amino acid of the receptor being altered from Val to Ala and removal of the stop codon. Fusion proteins of a palmitoylation-resistant (C442A) 2A-adrenoreceptor and either C351G or C3S/ C351G Gi1 also responded effectively to agonist Although a C442A mutation of the receptor has been reported not to interfere with G protein activation (27), we considered whether potential palmitoylation of this cysteine might alter agonist regulation of the fusion proteins as palmitoylation is believed to provide an extra site of membrane anchorage and generate a "fourth intracellular loop" in the receptor (11) Homogenates of mock-transfected cells (lanes 1 and 2) and those expressing wild-type (lanes 310) or C442A (lanes 1118) 2A-adrenoreceptor fusion proteins containing C351G Gi1 (lanes 3, 4, 11, and 12), C3S/C351G Gi1 (lanes 5, 6, 13, and 14), G2A/C351G Gi1 (lanes 7, 8, 15, and 16), or G2A/C3S/C351G Gi1 (lanes 9, 10, 17, and 18) were resolved into P2 particulate (even numbered lanes) and cytosolic (odd numbered lanes) preparations, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotted to detect the presence of Gi1 Effects of varying concentrations of UK14304 are shown for 2A-adrenoreceptor-C351G Gi1 (open circles), 2A-adrenoreceptor-C3S/C351G Gi1 (open diamonds), 2A-adrenoreceptor-G2A/C351G Gi1 (closed diamonds), or 2A-adrenoreceptor-G2A/C3S/C351G Gi1 (filled squares) fusion proteins containing wild-type receptor (A) or the C442A mutant (B) 2A-Adrenoreceptor-Gi1 Fusion Proteins 24675 G2A/C3S mutations were constructed with the C442A 2Aadrenoreceptor (Fig 2A-Adrenoreceptor-Gi1 Fusion Proteins 24676 a "fourth intracellular loop" in the receptor structure and because this receptor has only a short C-terminal tail, we also created chimeric fusion proteins between a C442A mutant of the 2A-adrenoreceptor and the various forms of Gi1 detailed above All of the C442A- 2A-adrenoreceptor-Gi1 fusions were also expressed and to similar levels as the versions that included the wild-type receptor (Fig Lee Limbird, Vanderbilt University, Tennessee, for provision of the wild-type and C442A forms of the porcine 2A-adrenoreceptor

10604981	These results are consistent with previously published work where the affinity of AR antagonists for D125A or D125K 1b-AR mutants also did not significantly change (Porter et al., 1996) As another control of our experimental system, we performed binding and pKa calculations on an 1b-AR saltbridge switch mutation (D125K/K331D) pH-dependent epinephrine affinity values for wt, K331D, D125A, and the D125K/K331D switch mutant Epinephrine affinity values are calculated from competition binding experiments performed at different pH values for the wt (F), K331D (E), D125A ( ), and D125K/K331D switch ( ) 1b-AR mutants However, as another test that changes in the pKa of the K331 mutants is due to effects on D125, a salt-bridge switch mutant (D125K/K331D) was analyzed for its pH-dependent binding behavior In other unpublished studies (Porter and Perez, 1999), the switch mutation, 1b-D125K/ K331D-AR reversed the constitutive activity of the single mutations also suggesting that these two residues are interacting in a salt-bridge Although some of the mutations displayed suggestion of a twosite fit revealing both a pKa1 and pKa2, a runs test on all curves displayed no significant deviation from the one-site modeled equation (K331A, P .54; K331H, P .92; K331Q, P .34; K331 M, P .20; K331L, P .20; K331D, P .20; K331W, P .20; K331E, P .20) Epinephrine affinity values are calculated from competition binding experiments performed at different pH values for the wt (F), K331A (E), K331M ( ), K331L (), K331D (,), K331W ( ), and K331E ( ) 1b-AR mutants The poorly expressed D125A 1b-AR mutant can be up-regulated in receptor density by adding 1 M prazosin to the medium 24 h before harvesting These results are consistent with previously published work where the affinity of AR antagonists for D125A or D125K 1b-AR mutants also did not significantly change (Porter et al., 1996) To further demonstrate the acidic pKa of the wt 1b-AR receptor is influenced by D125 and that changes in acidic pKa can be assigned to D125, the mutant 1b-D125A-AR was used in epinephrine competition binding studies 4; Table 1), elimination of this weaker acidic residue in the D125A mutant receptor would shift the resulting acidic pH profile to the left Epinephrine affinity values for the 1bD125A-AR mutant (E) are shown to demonstrate the influence of D125 on the acidic pKa values Calculated pKa values (arrows) for the D125A receptor mutant (5.98 0.04) was significantly different (P .05) from the wt 1b-AR (6.25 0.02) Because it is possible that the K331 mutants may display a two-site fit given that these mutations are not fully active and the residual acidic amino acids (from the D125A mutant) of binding display a pKa of 6, the K331 mutant binding curves may display a lower pKa component This 1b-AR switch mutation also displayed a nonsignificant binding profile from the D125A single mutant with no significant changes from its acidic pKa of 5.98 0.04 (Fig 3 where the D125A 1b-AR mutant has lower, but still significant, binding for epinephrine at all pH values pH-dependent epinephrine affinity values for wt, K331D, D125A, and the D125K/K331D switch mutant Epinephrine affinity values are calculated from competition binding experiments performed at different pH values for the wt (F), K331D (E), D125A ( ), and D125K/K331D switch ( ) 1b-AR mutants However, the binding affinities of epinephrine and calculated pKa of the switch mutant is not significantly different from the single D125A receptor mutant In the current study, we assign changes in the acidic pKa to D125 based on changes in the acid dissociation constant for the 1b-D125A-AR, the direct role D125 has in epinephrine binding to the 1b-AR (Porter et al., 1996), and the basic shift in the acidic profile of K331 1b-AR mutants The switch mutant, however, reversed the effects on both epinephrine affinity and pKa to values seen for the 1b-D125A-AR single mutant (Fig Because the switch mutant is not constitutively active and also displays a similar pKa as the D125A mutant receptor, it seems that the K331 receptor mutant effects on D125 pKa are attributable to disruption of the salt-bridge and not to the receptors constitutive phenotype Ki obs Ki J/J 1 H Ka1 { J/J} { J/J} (5) Equation 5 was used to generate theoretical curves at different J/J ratios using actual experimental data from the wt receptor to measure how well the K331Q mutant receptor data adhered to the equation Epinephrine competition curves for the wt and K331Q 1b-AR mutant are shown in Fig The higher affinity seen in the K331Q 1b-AR mutant is intrinsic to the receptor as assessed by adding 0.1 mM GppNHp to the binding assay (data not shown) The one-site model fitted for the wt or K331Q 1-AR is attributable to its transient expression in COS-1 cells, nonlimiting G-protein concentrations, and its specific coupling to Gq, which has a low intrinsic GTPase activity (Ross, 1995) Epinephrine competition curves for wt and K331Q mutant 1badrenergic receptors Epinephrine competition of specific [125I]HEAT binding to wt (F) or K331Q (E) 1b-ARs at pH 7.5 Nonlinear regression curves fit best to a one-site model (wt: DF1 57, DF2 55, SS1 4351, SS2 4217, F 0.87, P .05; K331Q: DF1 53, DF2 51, SS1 1820, SS2 1699, F 1.82, P .05) The binding affinity (Ki) of epinephrine (0.37 0.01 M) for the K331Q mutant 1b-AR was significantly greater (P .05) than for the wt receptor (1.8 0.1 M) Thus, KiH is assigned to the K331Q mutant receptor and KiL to the wt 1b-AR Although we realize that the K331Q mutant is not fully activated and conversely, that the wt receptor is not fully inactive, it is assumed that each receptor represents a majority of either the KiH or KiL states of the 1b-AR given the one-site fit The increased epinephrine affinity calculated for the K331Q 1b-AR mutant and assignment to KiH is based on whether the receptor is indeed constitutively active representing the R* state To confirm this, basal IP3 production was measured for both K331Q and K331H receptor mutants at physiological pH (7.3) and compared with the wt 1b-AR (Fig There was a significant increase (P .05) in the amount of IP3 produced for the K331Q receptor mutation (29.3 2.5 pmol/fmol receptor) when compared with the wt 1b-AR (15.8 1.0 pmol/fmol receptor), consistent with a mechanism involving disruption of an ionic constraint 3) or K331Q mutant 1b-AR (data not shown) The D125 pKa calculated for 1b-AR mutations K331Q and K331H is also shown in Fig The K331Q 1b-AR mutant had a calculated pKa of 7.07 0.05 that is shifted significantly (P .05) toward a higher value when compared with the wt receptor The amount of basal IP3 generated from COS-1 cells (10 6 cells) transfected with either the wt, K331H, or K331Q 1b-ARs was quantified and normalized to receptor number determined from parallel saturation binding experiments There was a significant increase (P .05) in the basal amount of IP3 generated per receptor for the K331Q (29.3 2.5 pmol/fmol) mutant receptor when compared with either K331H (17.8 2.1 pmol/ fmol) or the wt (15.8 1.0 pmol/fmol) 1b-AR Actual receptor density was 1.7 0.1 pmol/mg protein for the wt 1b-AR, 3.3 1.7 pmol/mg protein for the K331H mutant receptor and 1.5 0.8 pmol/mg protein for the K331Q receptor mutant Although some of the mutations displayed suggestion of a twosite fit revealing both a pKa1 and pKa2, a runs test on all curves displayed no significant deviation from the one-site modeled equation (K331A, P .54;

10766790	Neither F163Q nor F187A mutations of the 1a had any effect on the affinity of the 1-antagonists However, the affinity of the endogenous agonist epinephrine was reduced 12.5- and 8-fold by the F163Q and F187A mutations, respectively The potency but not the efficacy of epinephrine in stimulating phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis was reduced 35fold at the F163Q/F187A 1a relative to the wild type receptor The F187A mutation was generated using a sense primer containing the mutation that was targeted to the endogenous NaeI restriction site and an antisense primer containing the NotI restriction site after the stop codon The NaeI-F187A-NotI fragment was generated using the same protocol as before except that the reaction was performed with a final MgCl2 concentration of 4 mM Quantitation of Intracellular Inositol Phosphates (IP)--Studies to investigate the signaling capacity of the F163Q/F187A 1a-AR relative to the wild type 1a-AR were performed on COS-1 cells, plated on 60-mm culture plates, and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum The affinities of a panel of 1-AR selective antagonists at either the F163Q 1a-AR or the F187A 1a-AR were not significantly different from their respective affinity at the wild type 1a-AR To complete the characterization of the F163Q- and F187AFIG The affinity of the endogenous agonist epinephrine was reduced 12.5-fold by the F163Q mutation (p 0.01) and by a factor of 8-fold by the F187A mutation (p 0.01), suggesting that each phenylalanine residue is directly involved in stabilizing the catecholamine in the agonist binding pocket of the 1a-AR The F187A mutation had greater effects on the binding of the endogenous agonist epinephrine than on either of the phenethylamines Phenylephrine and methoxamine binding was reduced by factors of just 3- and 4-fold, respectively, by the F187A mutation (p 0.05), as opposed to the greater than 8-fold decrease in affinity for epinephrine induced by the same mutation To prove that these interactions between each phenylalanine residue and the catechol ring of the agonist are independent of one another, we constructed a mutant receptor expressing both mutations (F163Q/F187A 1a-AR) However, the affinity of epinephrine for the F163Q/F187A 1a-AR was found to be over 150-fold lower than its affinity at the wild type 1a-AR (p 0.001) A similar additive decrease in affinity at the F163Q/F187A 1a-AR was observed for phenylephrine (32-fold; p 0.01) Minimal effects on the binding affinity of oxymetazoline were observed at either the F163Q or the F187A mutation However, the affinity of this drug for the 1a-AR was actually increased 5-fold by the F187A mutation (p 0.05) Our observations indicate that these F163Q and F187A mutations have greater impact on the binding properties of catecholamines and phenethylamines than on the imidazoline class of agonists, suggesting that there are differences in the three-dimensional geometry of the agonist binding pocket recognized by these two drug classes The F163Q-, F187A-, and F163Q/F187A-mutated 1a-ARs all displayed phenotypes showing a reduced affinity for the endogenous agonist epinephrine The aim of this mutagenesis strategy was to TABLE I Agonist and antagonist binding affinities at wild type and phenylalanine mutations of the 1a-AR pKI values for the binding of agonists and antagonists were determined in competition binding studies on membranes transiently transfected to express wild type 1a-AR, F163Q, F187A, or F163Q/F187A mutations of the 1a-AR Affinities 1a-AR F163Q F187A F163Q/F187A pKI S.E Based on the changes in drug affinity at the F163Q/F187A 1a-AR, we can calculate that the two aromatic interactions in the 1a-AR contribute a total free energy equivalent of 2.95 kcal/mol toward the binding of epinephrine Stimulation of inositol phosphates by increasing concentrations of epinephrine at wild type 1a-AR (q) and F163Q/F187A 1a-ARs (E), transiently expressed in COS-1 cells The mean receptor expression on these cell membranes was 0.39 and 0.41 pmol/mg for wild type and F163Q/F187A 1a-AR, respectively Experiments were conducted in COS-1 cells that were transiently transfected to express either the wild type 1a-AR or the F163Q/F187A 1a-AR at equal receptor densities 3, the concentration-response curve for epinephrine in stimulating IP at the F163Q/F187A 1a-AR (EC50 4.89 1.1 M ) is shifted dramatically to the right of the wild type receptor response (EC50 0.13 0.08 M ) This shift represents a 36-fold decrease in the potency of epinephrine in stimulating IP at the F163Q/F187A 1a-AR (p 0.01), consistent with its change in affinity The efficacy (maximal response) of the epinephrine was not altered with respect to the wild type receptor by either of the F163Q and F187A mutations of the 1a-AR We conclude that the decreased potency of epinephrine at the F163Q/F187A 1a-AR results from the reduced occupancy of the receptor that is attributable to the phenylalanine residues acting as important binding contacts Therefore, the Q170F and A202F mutations were individually inserted into the coding sequence of the 2-AR by cassette oligonucleotide replacement and the mutant receptors expressed in COS-1 cells to study their agonist binding properties Incorporation of either the Q170F or the A202F mutation to the 2-AR did not appear to affect the global conformation of the receptor since the affinities of several antagonists were not found to be different from the observed wild type values (Table II) Small but statistically significant increases in the affinity of both epinephrine and isoproterenol were observed at both the Q170F or A202F mutations relative to their affinity at the WT 2-AR (Table II) The affinity of isoproterenol was increased by 1.6-fold (p 0.05) and by 2-fold (p 0.05) at the 2-ARs expressing the Q170F and A202F mutations, respectively Likewise, the affinity of epinephrine was increased 2.4-fold at the Q170F mutation (p 0.05) and by 1.65-fold at the A202F mutation Competition binding studies at this Q170F/A202F receptor revealed a larger 4.2-fold increase in affinity for both isoproterenol (p 0.05) and epinephrine (p 0.05) (Table III) The small increases in agonist affinity observed at the Q170Fand A202F- 2-ARs may therefore be due to an enhanced coupling of the mutant receptors to a G protein Measurement of the cAMP signal transduction pathway in COS-1 cells transiently transfected to express either the wild type or a mutant 2-AR revealed that the basal cAMP stimulation associated with either the Q170F or A202F 2-AR was not different from the wild type receptor (data not shown) In these experiments, a series of agonists with a variety of electron donating

Ephedrine was the only drug tested that displayed a greater gain in affinity (6-fold; p 0.01) than that of isoproterenol at the Q170F/A202F 2-AR Based on the binding profiles of dichloroisoproterenol (1.4-fold increase) and isoproterenol (4.2-fold increase) at the Q170F/ A202F 2-AR being proportional to the magnitude of the theoretical dipole moment in the catechol ring, we conclude that the gain in affinity displayed for agonists at this receptor is provided by aromatic interactions between the catechol ring of the drug and the phenylalanine residues substituted into TM4 and TM5 of the 2-AR Since neither of these phenylalanine residues are conserved in the TM4 and TM5 helices of the 2-AR, we expected to observe increases of similar magnitude in the affinity of epinephrine affinity for the Q170F/A202F 2-AR as a result of the receptors potential to bind the agonist by two novel aromatic interactions Contrary to our expectations, the observed change in free energy resulting from epinephrine binding at the Q170F/ A202F 2-AR was calculated to be only 0.75 kcal/mol Stimulation of cAMP in response to challenge with ephedrine in COS-1 cells transiently transfected to express wild

Conversely, the angle of orientation of the catechol ring of epinephrine in the binding pocket of the 2-AR is such that it minimizes the aromatic interactions with the Q170F or A202F mutations in this receptor, consistent with the proposed skewed orientation of epinephrine in the pocket and the resulting and less favorable edge to edge orientation of the phenylalanines to the catechol ring Ephedrine, which demonstrated the greatest increase in affinity (6-fold) at the double mutant, Q170F/A202F receptor, also produced a 4-fold leftward shift in potency (EC50 2.4 1.1 M ) when compared with the WT receptor (EC50 8.8 1.4 M ) with no change in the maximal response (Fig Therefore, the Q170F and A202F mutations were individually inserted into the coding sequence of the 2-AR by cassette

transfected to express either the wild type 1a-AR or the F163Q/F187A 1a-AR at equal receptor densities 3, the concentration-response curve for epinephrine in stimulating IP at the F163Q/F187A 1a-AR (EC50 4.89 1.1 M ) is shifted dramatically to the right of the wild type receptor response (EC50 0.13 0.08 M ) This shift represents a 36-fold decrease in the potency of epinephrine in stimulating IP at the F163Q/F187A 1a-AR (p 0.01), consistent with its change in affinity The efficacy (maximal response) of the epinephrine was not altered with respect to the wild type receptor by either of the F163Q and F187A mutations of the 1a-AR We conclude that the decreased potency of epinephrine at the F163Q/F187A 1a-AR results from the reduced occupancy of the receptor that is attributable to the phenylalanine residues acting as important binding contacts
