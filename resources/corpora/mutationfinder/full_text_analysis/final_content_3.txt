Preparation of SH3-SH22--The coding region for amino acid residues 83259 (containing an R174A mutation) of the chicken c-src gene was subcloned into the pGEX-6P-1 expression vector (Amersham Biosciences) with BamHI and XhoI sites on the 5 - and 3 -ends, respectively. Less than 5% phosphorylation of the Src Y527F protein in the presence of Csk was observed indicating a specific labeling on the tail tyrosine residue Tyr-527 of the above proteins. Fluorescence Binding Measurements--To measure the dissociation constants (KD) for binding of a SH2 domain binding peptide to the phosphorylated P-Src and non-phosphorylated Src-Y527F proteins, titration reactions were conducted by titrating fixed concentrations (1 M) of Rhod-SH2BP peptide with increasing amounts of the protein (0 90 M) on a SPEX Fluoromax spectrofluorometer using a 3-mmsquare cuvette (24). demonstrated previously (16, 18, 25), Csk is extremely selective for the C-terminal tyrosine of Src family members, which, in part, was confirmed here by demonstrating the lack of phosphorylation of the Y527F mutant. C, plot of fluorescence intensity at 605 nM versus the total concentration of added protein P-Src; D, SrcY527F. The KD values of 0.7 0.4 and 75 9 M were obtained from a fit to Equations 2 and 3 for P-Src and Src-Y527F, respectively. 1 for Structures)--The pET expression plasmid encoding kinase-inactive Src (amino acids 83533; K295M) (16) was used to generate the plasmids encoding point mutations in the SH3 domain (W118V; src-3), SH2 domain (R174A; src-2), and the double mutant (W118V/R174A; src-23) using the QuikChange method (Stratagene), and the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing of the entire open reading frames. 1 for Structures)--The pET expression plasmid encoding kinase-inactive Src (amino acids 83533; K295M) (16) was used to generate the plasmids encoding point mutations in the SH3 domain (W118V; src-3), SH2 domain (R174A; src-2), and the double mutant (W118V/R174A; src-23) using the QuikChange method (Stratagene), and the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing of the entire open reading frames.

11741929	The Y715F and Y735F double mutants (lanes 4 and 5) showed reduced Grb2 binding compared with wild-type ADAM15. The interaction of Lck with ADAM15 appears to be somewhat different from that of Grb2, since the Y715F/Y735F mutations increased Lck binding, and loss of the N-terminal part of the cytoplasmic domain (lanes 16 and 17) reduced binding back to levels seen with the unphosphorylated ADAM15 protein (lane 1). The Y715F/Y735F mutant reduced Grb2 binding to that of unphosphorylated wild-type ADAM15 cytoplasmic domain. The Y715F and Y735F double mutants (lanes 4 and 5) showed reduced Grb2 binding compared with wild-type ADAM15.

12087092	The lysates from NIH 3T3 cells expressing RET with a MEN2A (cysteine 634 3 arginine, C634R) mutation or from SK-N-MC cells expressing wild-type RET untreated or treated with GDNF (100 ng/ml) for 15 min were incubated with the GST-DOK1 fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads. A, the lysates from NIH 3T3 expressing RET(C634R), RET(C634R,Y1062F), RET(M918T), or RET(M918T,Y1062F) mutant proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-Dok1 antibody, followed by immunoblotting with anti-RET, anti-phosphotyrosine (PY), or anti-Dok1 antibody. DOK1 fusion protein was incubated with the lysates of NIH3T3 cells expressing human RET with a MEN2A (cysteine 634 3 arginine, C634R) or MEN2B mutation. To confirm the interaction between Dok1 and RET in the cells, the lysates from NIH3T3 cells expressing RET with MEN2A(C634R) or MEN2B(M918T) mutation were immunoprecipitated with anti-Dok1 antibody, followed by immunoblotting with anti-RET, anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-Dok1 antibody. A, the lysates from NIH 3T3 expressing RET(C634R), RET(C634R,Y1062F), RET(M918T), or RET(M918T,Y1062F) mutant proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-Dok1 antibody, followed by immunoblotting with anti-RET, anti-phosphotyrosine (PY), or anti-Dok1 antibody. Because tyrosine 1062 in RET was reported to be responsible for interaction of the Dok-5 PTB domain (22), we replaced tyrosine 1062 with phenylalanine (Y1062F). When the lysates from NIH3T3 cells expressing RET-MEN2A or RET-MEN2B with the Y1062F mutation were used for immunoprecipitation, coprecipitation of RET with Dok1 was hardly detected (Fig. erated FLAG-tagged Dok1 constructs with 3 tyrosine mutations (Y203F, Y340F and Y450F, designated 3F), 4 tyrosine mutations (Y295F, Y314F, Y361F, and Y376F, designated 4F), 6 tyrosine mutations (Y295F, Y314F, Y361F, Y376F, Y397F, and Y408F, designated 6F), or 10 tyrosine mutations (Y146F, Y203F, Y295F, Y314F, Y340F, Y361F, Y376F, Y397F, Y408F, and Y450F, designated 10F) (Fig. erated FLAG-tagged Dok1 constructs with 3 tyrosine mutations (Y203F, Y340F and Y450F, designated 3F), 4 tyrosine mutations (Y295F, Y314F, Y361F, and Y376F, designated 4F), 6 tyrosine mutations (Y295F, Y314F, Y361F, Y376F, Y397F, and Y408F, designated 6F), or 10 tyrosine mutations (Y146F, Y203F, Y295F, Y314F, Y340F, Y361F, Y376F, Y397F, Y408F, and Y450F, designated 10F) (Fig. erated FLAG-tagged Dok1 constructs with 3 tyrosine mutations (Y203F, Y340F and Y450F, designated 3F), 4 tyrosine mutations (Y295F, Y314F, Y361F, and Y376F, designated 4F), 6 tyrosine mutations (Y295F, Y314F, Y361F, Y376F, Y397F, and Y408F, designated 6F), or 10 tyrosine mutations (Y146F, Y203F, Y295F, Y314F, Y340F, Y361F, Y376F, Y397F, Y408F, and Y450F, designated 10F) (Fig. erated FLAG-tagged Dok1 constructs with 3 tyrosine mutations (Y203F, Y340F and Y450F, designated 3F), 4 tyrosine mutations (Y295F, Y314F, Y361F, and Y376F, designated 4F), 6 tyrosine mutations (Y295F, Y314F, Y361F, Y376F, Y397F, and Y408F, designated 6F), or 10 tyrosine mutations (Y146F, Y203F, Y295F, Y314F, Y340F, Y361F, Y376F, Y397F, Y408F, and Y450F, designated 10F) (Fig. erated FLAG-tagged Dok1 constructs with 3 tyrosine mutations (Y203F, Y340F and Y450F, designated 3F), 4 tyrosine mutations (Y295F, Y314F, Y361F, and Y376F, designated 4F), 6 tyrosine mutations (Y295F, Y314F, Y361F, Y376F, Y397F, and Y408F, designated 6F), or 10 tyrosine mutations (Y146F, Y203F, Y295F, Y314F, Y340F, Y361F, Y376F, Y397F, Y408F, and Y450F, designated 10F) (Fig. In addition, a couple of Hirschsprung mutations found in the COOH-terminal sequence of RET such as the L1061P and M1064T mutations impaired the binding of docking proteins to tyrosine 1062 (13, 57), thus resulting in a defect of RET-mediated signaling. erated FLAG-tagged Dok1 constructs with 3 tyrosine mutations (Y203F, Y340F and Y450F, designated 3F), 4 tyrosine mutations (Y295F, Y314F, Y361F, and Y376F, designated 4F), 6 tyrosine mutations (Y295F, Y314F, Y361F, Y376F, Y397F, and Y408F, designated 6F), or 10 tyrosine mutations (Y146F, Y203F, Y295F, Y314F, Y340F, Y361F, Y376F, Y397F, Y408F, and Y450F, designated 10F) (Fig. We replaced tyrosine 361 or these six tyrosines with phenylalanine (designated Y361F or 6F) in Dok1 and introduced the mutant Dok1 genes into the cells expressing the wild-type RET or RET-MEN2B protein. Overexpression of Dok1 or Dok1-Y361F, but not Dok1 6F, suppressed the Ras/Erk activation induced by glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor or RET-MEN2B, implying that this inhibitory effect requires the Ras-GTPase-activating protein binding to Dok1. In contrast, overexpression of Dok1, but not Dok1-Y361F or Dok1 6F, enhanced the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) and c-Jun activation. erated FLAG-tagged Dok1 constructs with 3 tyrosine mutations (Y203F, Y340F and Y450F, designated 3F), 4 tyrosine mutations (Y295F, Y314F, Y361F, and Y376F, designated 4F), 6 tyrosine mutations (Y295F, Y314F, Y361F, Y376F, Y397F, and Y408F, designated 6F), or 10 tyrosine mutations (Y146F, Y203F, Y295F, Y314F, Y340F, Y361F, Y376F, Y397F, Y408F, and Y450F, designated 10F) (Fig. The association of Nck with Dok1 was almost abolished by the Y361F single mutation as well as 6F and 10F mutations including Y361F (Fig. Co-expression of Dok1-WT or Dok1-Y361F reduced the RET-MEN2B-induced luciferase activity by 50 60%, whereas expression of Dok1 6F, which cannot bind RAS-GAP, increased its activity by 50% (Fig. To further elucidate the role of Dok1 in Erk activation, we transfected FLAG-tagged Dok1-WT, Dok1-Y361F, or Dok1 6F into NIH-RET(MEN2B) or SK-N-MC(RET) cells, and compared the levels of Erk1/2 phosphorylation among the transfectants. Consistent with the results of the luciferase reporter gene assay, overexpression of Dok1-WT or Dok1-Y361F significantly impaired the Erk1/2 phosphorylation induced by RET-MEN2B (Fig. C, SK-N-MC cells were transiently transfected with the SRE-luciferase reporter construct, phRL-TK carrying the Renilla luciferase gene, and pCMV-RET(MEN2B) together with the expression plasmids carrying Dok1-WT, Dok1-Y361F, Dok1 6F, Shc, or Ras-N17 (dominant negative Ras), or with the empty plasmid (control). D, SK-N-MC expressing wild-type RET were transfected with the SRE-reporter construct and phRL-TK together with the expression plasmids carrying Dok1-WT, Dok1-Y361F, Dok1 6F, or Shc. E, SK-N-MC cells were transiently transfected with pFR-Luc, phRL-TK, and pcDNA-GAL4DB-c-Jun constructs shown in B and pCMV-RET(MEN2B) together with the expression plasmids carrying Dok1-WT, Dok1-Y361F, Dok1 6F, or Shc, or with the empty plasmid (control).

NIH-RET(MEN2B) cells were transiently transfected with the pFLAG-CMV2 plasmids carrying Dok1-WT, Dok1-Y361F, Dok1 6F, or with the empty plasmid (control). B, SK-N-MC(RET) cells were transiently transfected with the pFLAG-CMV2 plasmids carrying Dok1-WT, Dok1-Y361F, Dok1 6F, or with the empty plasmid (control). 6C, the amount of GTP-bound Ras significantly decreased in the transfectant expressing Dok1-WT or Dok1Y361F but not in the transfectant expressing Dok1 6F, suggesting that Ras-GAP binding to Dok1 impairs the Ras activation. On the other hand, co-expres- sion of RET-MEN2B and Dok1-Y361F or Dok1 6F decreased the luciferase activity by 25% as compared with that induced by RET-MEN2B expression only (Fig 5E). In addition, expression of Dok13F that can bind Nck also increased the JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation (data not shown), whereas expression of Dok1-Y361F or Dok1 6F attenuated their phosphorylation (Fig. erated FLAG-tagged Dok1 constructs with 3 tyrosine mutations (Y203F, Y340F and Y450F, designated 3F), 4 tyrosine mutations (Y295F, Y314F, Y361F, and Y376F, designated 4F), 6 tyrosine mutations (Y295F, Y314F, Y361F, Y376F, Y397F, and Y408F, designated 6F), or 10 tyrosine mutations (Y146F, Y203F, Y295F, Y314F, Y340F, Y361F, Y376F, Y397F, Y408F, and Y450F, designated 10F) (Fig. In addition, a couple of Hirschsprung mutations found in the COOH-terminal sequence of RET such as the L1061P and M1064T mutations impaired the binding of docking proteins to tyrosine 1062 (13, 57), thus resulting in a defect of RET-mediated signaling. The cDNA fragments corresponding to the intracellular domain of wild-type RET or RET with a MEN2B mutation (methionine 918 3 threonine, M918T) were fused in frame to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 transcription factor (GAL4-DB) in the pAS21 vector. C, interaction of RET-MEN2B(M918T) with human DOK1 in yeast two-hybrid system. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Yeast Two-hybrid Screening--An 1.2-kbp EcoRI-XhoI cDNA fragment encoding the cytoplasmic domain of human RET with a MEN2B mutation (M918T) was amplified by PCR and fused to the sequence encoding the GAL4 DNA binding domain (DB) in the pAS21 vector (CLONTECH). The cells were co-transfected with 150 ng of SRE-reporter plasmid, 50 ng of phRL-TK plasmid carrying the Renilla luciferase gene (Promega), 600 ng of pCMV-RET(M918T), and 1 g of various mutant Dok1 expression constructs (CMV-Dok1s), CMVShc or CMV-RasN17 construct by LipofectoAMINE2000 methods (Invitrogen) according to the specifications of the manufacturer. The cells were transfected with 150 ng of GAL4-responsive pFR-Luc reporter plasmid (Stratagene), 50 ng of phRL-TK plasmid, 400 ng of pcDNA-GAL4 DNA binding domain-c-Jun fusion construct (pcDNA-GAL4DB-c-Jun), 600 ng of pCMV-RET(M918T), and 1 g of various Dok1 expression constructs (CMV-Doks) or CMV-Shc construct by LipofectAMINE2000 methods. A human RET cDNA corresponding to the intracellular domain (amino acids 718 1114) with or without a MEN2B mutation (methionine 918 3 threonine, M918T) was fused in frame to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 transcription factor in the pAS21 plasmid as a bait (Fig. A, the lysates from NIH 3T3 expressing RET(C634R), RET(C634R,Y1062F), RET(M918T), or RET(M918T,Y1062F) mutant proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-Dok1 antibody, followed by immunoblotting with anti-RET, anti-phosphotyrosine (PY), or anti-Dok1 antibody. B, FLAG-tagged wild-type mouse Dok1 was introduced into NIH3T3, NIH-RET(634R), or NIH-RET(M918T) cells. C, FLAG-tagged wild-type Dok1, Dok1-AA, or Dok1-delPH was introduced into NIH-RET(M918T) cells. To confirm the interaction between Dok1 and RET in the cells, the lysates from NIH3T3 cells expressing RET with MEN2A(C634R) or MEN2B(M918T) mutation were immunoprecipitated with anti-Dok1 antibody, followed by immunoblotting with anti-RET, anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-Dok1 antibody. erated FLAG-tagged Dok1 constructs with 3 tyrosine mutations (Y203F, Y340F and Y450F, designated 3F), 4 tyrosine mutations (Y295F, Y314F, Y361F, and Y376F, designated 4F), 6 tyrosine mutations (Y295F, Y314F, Y361F, Y376F, Y397F, and Y408F, designated 6F), or 10 tyrosine mutations (Y146F, Y203F, Y295F, Y314F, Y340F, Y361F, Y376F, Y397F, Y408F, and Y450F, designated 10F) (Fig. erated FLAG-tagged Dok1 constructs with 3 tyrosine mutations (Y203F, Y340F and Y450F, designated 3F), 4 tyrosine mutations (Y295F, Y314F, Y361F, and Y376F, designated 4F), 6 tyrosine mutations (Y295F, Y314F, Y361F, Y376F, Y397F, and Y408F, designated 6F), or 10 tyrosine mutations (Y146F, Y203F, Y295F, Y314F, Y340F, Y361F, Y376F, Y397F, Y408F, and Y450F, designated 10F) (Fig.

COS-7 cells were transfected with WT JAK3 (lane 1) or K855A (lane 2), Y980F (lane 3), Y981F (lane 4), and YY980 981FF (lane 5) mutant forms of JAK3. independent of JAK1 and other PTKs in COS-7 cells because no phosphorylation of mutant K855A is observed. 4, lane 5) or when STAT5A was coexpressed with the catalytically inactive mutant, K855A (Fig. 5, no protein binding to the DNA probe was detected in COS-7 cells transfected with STAT5A only, STAT5A with mutant K855A, or in a mock transfection (Fig. COS-7 cells were transfected with cDNAs (5 g) encoding: WT JAK3 (lane 1), K855A (lane 2), Y980F (lane 3), Y981F (lane 4), and YY980 981FF (lane 5). COS-7 cells were cotransfected with 5 g Tac- c cDNA and 5 g cDNAs encoding: K855A (lane 1), JAK3 (lane 2), Y980F (lane 3), Y981F (lane 4), and YY980 981FF (lane 5), or transfected with 5 g Tac- c cDNA only (lane 6), and immunoprecipitated with a mAb anti-Tac (7G7). COS-7 cells were cotransfected with STAT5A cDNA (5 g) and the cDNAs (5 g) encoding: WT JAK3 (lane 1), K855A (lane 2), Y980F (lane 3), and Y981F (lane 4), or transfected with 5 g STAT5A cDNA only (lane 5). COS-7 cells were transfected with 5 g STAT5A cDNA only (lanes 1, 8, 13, and 17) or cotransfected with 5 g STAT5A and 5 g cDNAs encoding: WT JAK3 (lanes 2, 9, 14, and 18), K855A (lane 3), Y980F (lanes 4, 10, 15, and 19), Y981F (lanes 5, 11, 16, and 20), or YY980 981FF (lanes 6 and 12), or mock transfected (lane 7). Furthermore, no phosphorylation of mutant K855A was observed in COS-7 cells, suggesting that JAK1 and other endogenous PTKs cannot phosphorylate JAK3 without activation. Compared with the activity of wild-type (WT) JAK3, mutant Y980F demonstrated markedly decreased kinase activity, and optimal phosphorylation of JAK3 on other sites was dependent on Y980 phosphorylation. The mutant Y980F also exhibited reduced phosphorylation of its substrates, c and STAT5A. To this end, both tyrosine residues were first mutated to phenylalanine individually or doubly (referred to as Y980F, Y981F, and YY980 981FF, respectively) by site-directed mutagenesis and confirmed by DNA sequencing. 1A (Upper Right), the phosphopeptide designated spot b was disproportionately reduced when the autophosphorylated peptides of mutant Y980F were analyzed, suggesting that spot b contains Y980. The signal in the other phosphorylated peptides of mutant Y980F was weaker as well, but to a much lesser extent than spot b. In addition, slightly residual phosphorylation of spot b was present in mutant Y980F when compared with the map of mutant YY980 981FF (Fig. 2A, substantially reduced phosphorylation was observed upon incubation with the mutant Y980F (Fig. 3A, lane 1), mutant Y980F exhibited markedly decreased levels of phosphorylation (Fig. WT JAK3, mutant Y980F, mutant Y981F, and mutant YY980 981FF were expressed in COS-7 cells and immunoprecipitated using anti-JAK3 C-terminal antiserum, and in vitro kinase assays were performed for 10 min at room temperature. Because of the effect of the mutations on kinase activity, the exposure time was varied to achieve similar intensities for the map of each mutant (exposure time: Y980F, 96 hr; YY980 981FF, 48 hr; WT JAK3, 16 hr; and Y981F, 6 hr). In addition, the intensity of the signals suggested that the Y980F mutant had reduced kinase activity, whereas mutant Y981F appeared to have greater activity (Fig. To confirm the effects of these mutations on JAK3 kinase activity, we directly compared the catalytic activity of expressed WT JAK3 with that of mutants Y980F, Y981F, and YY980 981FF using an in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 2, autophosphorylation of mutant Y980F was markedly decreased (Fig. COS-7 cells were transfected with WT JAK3 (lane 1) or K855A (lane 2), Y980F (lane 3), Y981F (lane 4), and YY980 981FF (lane 5) mutant forms of JAK3. Consistent with what was observed using c, the phosphorylation of STAT5A was markedly decreased upon cotransfection with Y980F (Fig. However, much less DNA-binding activity was observed when STAT5A was cotransfected with mutant Y980F (Fig. COS-7 cells were transfected with cDNAs (5 g) encoding: WT JAK3 (lane 1), K855A (lane 2), Y980F (lane 3), Y981F (lane 4), and YY980 981FF (lane 5).

COS-7 cells were transfected with 5 g STAT5A cDNA only (lanes 1, 8, 13, and 17) or cotransfected with 5 g STAT5A and 5 g cDNAs encoding: WT JAK3 (lanes 2, 9, 14, and 18), K855A (lane 3), Y980F (lanes 4, 10, 15, and 19), Y981F (lanes 5, 11, 16, and 20), or YY980 981FF (lanes 6 and 12), or mock transfected (lane 7). In contrast, mutant Y981F had greatly increased kinase activity, whereas the double mutant, YY980 981FF, had intermediate activity. To this end, both tyrosine residues were first mutated to phenylalanine individually or doubly (referred to as Y980F, Y981F, and YY980 981FF, respectively) by site-directed mutagenesis and confirmed by DNA sequencing. 2B, lane 3), whereas greater phosphorylation was observed with the mutant Y981F (Fig. 3A, lane 3), whereas mutant Y981F demonstrated increased level of autophosphorylation (Fig. WT JAK3, mutant Y980F, mutant Y981F, and mutant YY980 981FF were expressed in COS-7 cells and immunoprecipitated using anti-JAK3 C-terminal antiserum, and in vitro kinase assays were performed for 10 min at room temperature.

11015576	(19) could show that mutant FGFR3 (K650E and to a lesser extend N540K) leads to a reduction of the mature glycosylated form of the receptor and a ligand-independent phosphorylation of the less glycosylated precursor form of the receptor in the cells. In a patient with Crouzon's syndrome, an S257P exchange in the FGFR2 gene was described (26) that disturbed the first putative N-glycosylation site in the IgIIIa exon. Up to now, two different amino acid conversions in the FGFR3 gene have been identified in HCH patients: an N540K exchange, which is present in about 4060% of the patients (1, 6, 18, 21), and an I538V exchange, which has been reported in one case (4). Up to now, two different amino acid conversions in the FGFR3 gene have been identified in HCH patients: an N540K exchange, which is present in about 4060% of the patients (1, 6, 18, 21), and an I538V exchange, which has been reported in one case (4). (19) could show that mutant FGFR3 (K650E and to a lesser extend N540K) leads to a reduction of the mature glycosylated form of the receptor and a ligand-independent phosphorylation of the less glycosylated precursor form of the receptor in the cells. In addition, it should be reinvestigated whether other HCH cases without the common N540K mutation are due to similar mutations in the extracellular part of the receptor and/or altered glycosylation of the receptor. This point mutation, an N328I exchange in the extracellular Ig domain III of the receptor, seems to be unique as it affects a putative N-glycosylation site that is conserved between different FGFRs and species. To investigate whether the observed N328I exchange itself has a probable effect on the folding of the IgIII loop, we tried to build a provisional homology model for the normal and mutant IgIII domain (Fig. 1A6U) from Mus musculus, strain C57BL/6 (red): normal FGFR3 sequence (left) and mutant (N328I) FGFR3 sequence (right). (17), it is tempting to speculate that the phenotypic effect of the N328I mutation may be due to a disruption of the putative Nglycosylation site (N-V-T), resulting in altered glycosylation and changes in the overall structure of the receptor. Therefore, it can be assumed that this mutation, in contrast to the described N328I exchange, may influence correct FGFR function by a direct effect on the receptor structure, rather than by the disruption of an N-glycosylation site. 
15728811	The delL747S752 mutation (the initial EGFR mutation identified in our patient) and a second mutation in which methionine was substituted for threonine at position 790 (T790M -- the second EGFR mutation identified in our patient) were introduced by means of a site-directed mutagenesis kit (QuikChange XL, Stratagene). To illustrate potential inhibitor clashes with the T790M mutant, we prepared figures in which threonine at position 790 (T790) is mutated to methionine. The C-to-T base-pair change is predicted to change threonine to methionine at position 790 (T790M) in the catalytic cleft of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain. A T790M substitution is predicted to lead to a similar steric clash with the gefitinib molecule (Fig. To confirm the functional effects predicted by our structural model, the T790M substitution was introduced into the sequence of the wild-type EGFR, delL747P753insS mutant EGFR (a frequently identified deletion mutant), the L858R mutant EGFR (the most common point mutation), and the delL747S752 mutant. original construct with the T790M mutation).

Panel A shows the crystallographically determined binding of erlotinib to wildtype EGFR, whereas Panel B shows how the T790M mutation leads to steric hindrance of erlotinib binding owing to the presence of the bulkier methionine side chain (orange) in the ATP-kinasebinding pocket. Panel C shows the steric hindrance in the predicted complex of gefitinib and EGFR with the T790M mutation. Panel D shows the predicted binding of CL-387,785 to EGFR with the T790M mutation (structural change introduced by the T790M mutation shown in orange). In contrast, when transiently transfected COS-7 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of gefitinib before EGF stimulation, the original constructs were fully inhibited at a concentration of 20 nM, whereas all four constructs carrying the T790M amino acid substitution demonstrated high-level resistance, with persistent generation of phosphorylated EGFR at concentrations of gefitinib as high as 2 M (Fig. To determine whether the T790M mutation leads to resistance to EGFR inhibitors that have different molecular structures and mechanisms, we screened four commercially available EGFR inhibitors (AG1478, cetuximab, erlotinib, and CL-387,785) using cells that were transiently transfected with the delL747S752 construct and the delL747S752+ n engl j med 352;8 www.nejm.org february 24, 2005 789 Downloaded from www.nejm.org at UC SHARED JOURNAL COLLECTION on December 6, 2005 .

The sensitivity of the delL747S752+T790M construct to CL-387,785 might be explained by either its altered binding to the kinase domain or its covalent binding to EGFR. In chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, the two main mechanisms of resistance to imatinib are point mutations or, less commonly, amplification of the BCR-ABL gene.18-20 Knowledge of these mechanisms has led to the development of second-generation BCR-ABL inhibitors.21 Interestingly, one of the most common imatinib resistance mutations in BCR-ABL replaces threonine at position 315 (the amino acid structurally corresponding to T790 of EGFR) with isoleucine in the ABL tyrosine kinase domain (T315I), leading to a structural change very similar to that observed with EGFR T790M.18 In fact, on the basis of the structural similarity between ABL and EGFR tyrosine kinases, the T790M change has been introduced into wild-type EGFR; this altered EGFR has high-level resistance to anilinoquinazoline inhibitors.22 Daily oral administration of gefitinib at recommended doses results in mean steady-state plasma concentrations of 0.4 to 1.4 M.23 Since at these levels the T790M mutation still allows the activation of EGFR, the presence of such a mutation might result in clinical resistance. Although the T315I substitution in BCR-ABL confers high-level resistance to all tested inhibitor compounds, the corresponding T790M mutation . These mutations are small deletions that affect amino acids 747 through 750 or point mutations (most commonly a replacement of leucine by arginine at codon 858 [L858R]).9-11 These mutations mediate oncogenic effects by altering downstream signaling and antiapoptotic mechanisms.12 Both types of mutation increase the sensitivity of the tumor to anilinoquinazoline inhibitors of EGFR, most likely by repositioning critical residues surrounding the ATP-binding cleft of the tyrosine kinase domain of the receptor, thereby stabilizing their interactions with both ATP and its competitive inhibitors.9,10 Notwithstanding the success of these drugs in cases of nonsmall-cell lung cancer with activating EGFR mutations, it appears that all cases eventually progress despite such treatment.

10793137	In contrast, LckY505F and Lck SH2, constitutively active Lck mutants lacking the C-terminal regulatory tyrosine or the entire Src homology 2 domain, respectively, required Hsp90 activity to stabilize the mature proteins. NIH-3T3 cells stably transfected with Lck (Bijlmakers et al., 1997), LckY505F, Lck SH2, or c-Src (Pelchen-Matthews et al., 1992) were grown in DMEM, 10% FCS, and pen/strep. The LckY505F cDNA was provided by D. LckY505F and Lck SH2 were transfected into NIH-3T3 fibroblasts by electroporation as described previously (Bijlmakers et al., 1997). Hsp90 Is Required to Stabilize Mature LckY505F and Lck SH2 Src-kinases are composed of four domains; an N-terminal unique domain is followed by an SH3, an SH2, and a tyrosine kinase domain (Brown and Cooper, 1996). In contrast to our result with wild-type (wt) Lck, it was reported previously that Hsp90 is required for the stability and activity of LckY505F (Hartson et al., 1996), a constitutively active Lck mutant with the C-terminal regulatory tyrosine 505 substituted by a phenylalanine. We compared the effects of Hsp90 inhibitors on the steady-state levels of LckY505F and wt Lck in transfected fibroblasts. In contrast, LckY505F levels were significantly reduced after incubation with either geldanamycin or radicicol (Figure 2B). This reduction was not caused by a lack of LckY505F synthesis during drug treatment, because inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide for the same time did not lead to a loss of LckY505F (Figure 2B). Therefore, the reduced steady-state level of LckY505F after drug treatment is most likely caused by the disappearance of mature LckY505F. Similar to wt Lck, the steady-state levels of endogenous wt c-Src in the LckY505F-transfected cells were not affected by geldanamycin or radicicol (Figure 2B). Similar to LckY505F, steady-state levels of Lck SH2 were significantly reduced after a 3.5-h incubation with Hsp90 inhibitors, whereas again endogenous c-Src levels were not affected (Figure 2C). Stable expression of LckY505F and Lck SH2 requires Hsp90. NIH-3T3 cells transfected with wt Lck (A), LckY505F (B), or Lck SH2 (C) were treated without ( ) or with 5 M geldanamycin (GA), 10 M radicicol (Rad), or 100 g/ml cycloheximide (Chx) for 3.5 h. In contrast, Hsp90 is required for the stability of the Lck mutants LckY505F and Lck SH2. In contrast, the Lck mutants LckY505F and Lck SH2 showed reduced protein levels when Hsp90 function was inhibited (Figure 2). The point mutation in LckY505F prevents the normal intramolecular interaction between the regulatory phosphotyrosine 505 and the SH2 domain. 
15155808	Abl-T315I, Arg-T314I, and N-Src-346M were made using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis technology (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). To develop PD-resistant alleles of Abl and Arg, we took advantage of a mutation in BCR-Abl, T315I, acquired by CML patients who develop resistance to STI-571 (Gorre et al., 2001). The T315I mutation is in the ATP-binding domain of Abl and prevents inhibition of Abl by STI-571 by disrupting a hydrogen bond between T315 and STI-571 (Gorre et al., 2001; Nagar et al., 2002). Together, the structural data indicate that Abl-T315I binds PD less effectively that Abl-WT. To test whether lower efficacy of binding affects the capacity of PD to inhibit kinase activity, we assessed the kinase activity of Abl-WT and Abl-T315I in the presence of the drug. We expressed Abl-WT or Abl-T315I in 293 cells and then isolated the overexpressed Abl proteins by immunoprecipitation with -Abl mAb 8E9. By contrast, PD had little effect on the activity of Abl-T315I (Figure 6C, lanes 5 and 6), although high concentrations of PD ( 500 nM) did partially block activity (our unpublished data). Stripping and reprobing the blot with -Abl mAb 8E9 confirmed that the amount of precipitated Abl-WT or Abl-T315I protein was equivalent (Figure 6C, bottom). Thus, in accordance with the structural predictions, Abl-T315I activity was much less susceptible to block by PD than Abl-WT. To test whether Abl was sufficient for pedestal formation, we expressed Abl-T315I in 3T3 cells cultured in PD and then infected the cells with EPEC. As seen in Figure 7, il, pedestal formation as well as localization of phosphotyrosine beneath attached bacterium (Figure 7, il) was evident in PD-treated cells expressing Abl-T315I, but not in cells expressing endogenous Abl (Figure 7, a d). We next tested the possibility that overexpression of Abl-T315I could, via a low-affinity interaction with PD, reduce the effective concentration of PD. To do this, we overexpressed Abl-WT, which has a higher affinity for PD than Abl-T315I. When PD was added after pedestals had formed, expression of c-Abl-T315I also prevented loss of tyrosine phosphorylation in the pedestal (Supplementary Figure 6, il). At this time point, pedestals were still evident in cells expressing endogenous Abl, Abl-WT, and Abl-T315I. After an hour, however, pedestals were only evident in cells expressing Abl-T315I. To test whether Abl-T315I was unique in its capacity to rescue pedestal formation and tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence of PD, we constructed and tested a PD-resistant mutant of Arg. We next tested whether rescue of pedestal formation in PD by Abl-T315I or Arg-T314I was due to nonspecific phosphorylation by an overexpressed tyrosine kinase. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that overexpression of Abl-T315I or Arg-T314I results in nonspecific phosphorylation of targets critical for pedestal formation, this possibility seems unlikely because PD-resistant alleles of other kinases (e.g., v-Src-338I), including those which localize in pedestals (e.g., N-Src-T346M), fail to rescue pedestal formation in the presence of PD. PD blocks activity of Abl-WT but not Abl-T315I. (A and B) Crystal structure of PD-166326 in the ATP-binding pocket of Abl-WT (A) and Abl-T315I (B). (C) PD-166326 blocks kinase activity of Abl-WT but not Abl-T315I. Analysis of kinase activity in untransfected 293 cells (lanes 1 and 2) or in 293 cells transiently transfected with Abl-WT (lanes 3 and 4) or AblT315I (lanes 5 and 6). An equivalent amount of Abl immunoprecipitated from cells transfected with Abl-WT or Abl-T315I (see below). PD blocked kinase activity of precipitates from Abl-WT cells (lane 4), but not Abl-T315I cells. Expression of PD-resistant mutant Abl-T315I permits pedestal formation and tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence of PD. (al) Images of 3T3 cells transfected with vector (ad), Abl-WT (eh), or Abl-T315I (il), treated with 10 M PD, and infected with EPEC for 5 h. Note the p-Tyr staining (l) and pedestals (j) are present in cells transfected with Abl-T315I, but not with vector (b and d) or Abl-WT (f and h). Note also that transfected Abl-T315I (k) localizes in the pedestal. Transfected Abl-WT protein was capable of phosphorylating GST-CrkII but not GST-CrkII- Y221F (our unpublished data), a nonphosphorylatable mutant (Ren et al., 1994). Thus, N-Src-T346M localized in pedestals, whereas v-Src-338I did not (our unpublished data). However, neither v-Src-338I nor N-Src-T346M was capable of maintaining phosphotyrosine staining under the bacteria (Supplementary Figure 7, bi), or rescuing pedestal formation (our unpublished data) in the presence of PD. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that overexpression of Abl-T315I or Arg-T314I results in nonspecific phosphorylation of targets critical for pedestal formation, this possibility seems unlikely because PD-resistant alleles of other kinases (e.g., v-Src-338I), including those which localize in pedestals (e.g., N-Src-T346M), fail to rescue pedestal formation in the presence of PD.

RT-PCR analysis (data not shown; performed as described23) of the 8 samples chosen revealed that 4 of the samples expressed FLT3/ITD mutations and one contained a Asp835Tyr mutation.

15377998	In the present study, we identified two point mutations in the Tie2 kinase domain from 37 haemangioma samples: a G2646A change resulting in a glycine to aspartic acid substitution at residue 833 (G833D) in eight unrelated patients and another A2659T change resulting in a glutamine to histidine substitution at residue 837 (Q837H) in one patient (Figure 1a and b). Empty mammalian expression vectors or vectors carrying full-length cDNA encoding the G2646A or A2659T mutation, or normal Tie2 cDNA, were transfected into MSS31 using the calcium phosphate method. Here, we report a mutation of glycine to aspartic acid at the second glycine of the GXGXXG motif of Tie2 (G833DTie2) in human intramuscular haemangiomas (IMHs) of the capillary type. Murine endothelial cells (ECs) overexpressing this G833DTie2 receptor exhibited an increase in cell proliferation at low serum concentrations and angiosarcomas developed in nude mice, whereas cells overexpressing either wild-type Tie2 or Q837HTie2 failed to elicit these responses. Furthermore, the G833DTie2 receptor increased VEGF expression in ECs. In the present study, we identified two point mutations in the Tie2 kinase domain from 37 haemangioma samples: a G2646A change resulting in a glycine to aspartic acid substitution at residue 833 (G833D) in eight unrelated patients and another A2659T change resulting in a glutamine to histidine substitution at residue 837 (Q837H) in one patient (Figure 1a and b). All of the patients with the G833D mutation had a large disfiguring lesion affecting one side of the face, and associated early postoperative recurrence, whereas the patient with the Q837H mutation had no recurrence during postoperative follow-up after 5 years. Histological sections of the G833D tumours showed a number of small capillary-sized vessels that extended between individual muscle fibres. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that the expression of Tie2 protein was moderate in G833D-tumour ECs (Figure 1d), and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein was upregulated (Figure 1e) when compared to human normal muscular tissue (Figure 1h). Pathological evaluation revealed that the G833D tumours were IMHs of the capillary type, whereas the Q837H lesion was an IMH of the cavernous type. G833DTie2 showed a 2.9fold increase in ligand-independent autophosphorylation relative to wild-type Tie2, whereas Q837HTie2 showed Mutation of Tie2 gene in IMHs H Wang et al 8701 Figure 1 Tie2 mutations in human intramuscular haemangiomas. (c) G833D tumour from case 2656 illustrates the separation of muscle fibres by a number of small capillary vessels. (d, e and h) G833D tumours were immunostained with antibody against Tie2 (d); C-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), or against VEGF (e; sc-507; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), or normal tissue against VEGF (h) according to the methods described previously (Zhang et al., 2001). Consistent with their ligandindependent phosphorylation, Q837HTie2 stimulated activation of STAT3 more strongly than G833DTie2. These data indicate that the G833D and Q837H mutations in Tie2 result in ligand-independent hyperphosphorylation of the receptor and promote the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3. Western blot analysis showed that there was no significant difference in Tie2 protein expression among MSS31G833D, MSS31Q837H, and MSS31wild-type cells (Figure 2e). The morphology of MSS31 cells transfected with G833D, Q837H, wild-type Tie2, or vector MSS31Q837H, MSS31wild-type, or (MSS31G833D, MSS31vector, respectively) was similar to the morphology of primary ECs in culture. However, MSS31G833D growth was significantly faster, and MSS31wild-type growth was significantly slower when compared with MSS31vector or MSS31Q837H when cultured with 0.5% serum (Figure 2f). This result implies that Tie2 signalling might mediate EC growth and that the G833D mutant enhances EC proliferation. In vivo studies showed that all 10 mice inoculated with 5 106 MSS31G833D cells produced tumours after 813 weeks (Figure 3a), whereas mice inoculated with the same number of MSS31Q837H, MSS31wild-type, or MSS31vector cells did not develop tumours. These results demonstrate that G833DTie2 induces malignant transformation of murine ECs. Either the G833D or Q837H mutation was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the Altered Sites II Mammalian Mutagenesis System (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA). MSS31Q837H (&), MSS31vector (E), and MSS31wild-type (W) had doubling times of 4773.98, 5474.04, and 6875.49 h, respectively, whereas MSS31G833D (J) proliferated with a doubling time of 33.271.47 h. The doubling time of MSS31G833D growth was significantly shorter, whereas the doubling time of MSS31wild-type was significantly longer when compared with MSS31vector or MSS31Q837H. Notably, upregulation of VEGF expression was observed in G833D-transfected MSS31 cells in vivo (Figure 3h and l). Northern Oncogene blot analysis showed that there was no significant difference in Tie2 mRNA expression among MSS31G833D, MSS31Q837H, and MSS31wild-type cells. However, MSS31G833D cells expressed more VEGF mRNA than MSS31wild-type or MSS31Q837H cells when cultured with 0.5% serum. These results suggest that Tie2 signalling is important for normal levels of VEGF expression and that perturbation of Tie2 signalling by the G833D mutation induces constitutive VEGF expression. (el) Immunohistochemistry of mice G833D expressing tumours. MSS31G833D cells expressed more VEGF mRNA than MSS31wild-type cells when cultured with 0.5% serum, although they expressed equal amounts of Tie2 mRNA (Tie2, top panel; VEGF, middle panel; or GAPDH, bottom panel). *Location of the two missense mutations The G833D mutation occurs at the second glycine residue of the GXGXXG motif (residues 832835) within the nucleotide-binding loop, whereas Q837H affects the glutamine adjacent to the third glycine. The G833DTie2 mutant, which is found in benign human vascular tumours, induces malignant vascular tumours in nude mice. On the other hand, the induction here of mice angiosarcomas also raises the possibility that the G833D mutation occurs in angiosarcomas. We have shown that the G833D mutation in the Tie2 receptor induces transformation of murine vascular ECs, as defined by the enhancement of EC proliferation and angiosarcoma formation. The data presented here, however, demonstrate that there are significant characteristics of the G833D mutation with respect to transforming activity and VEGF expression. These characteristics could reflect clinical phenotype of early postoperative recurrence in the human G833D IMHs. Murine endothelial cells (ECs) overexpressing this G833DTie2 receptor exhibited an increase in cell proliferation at low serum concentrations and angiosarcomas developed in nude mice, whereas cells overexpressing either wild-type Tie2 or Q837HTie2 failed to elicit these responses. In the present study, we identified two point mutations in the Tie2 kinase domain from 37 haemangioma samples: a G2646A change resulting in a glycine to aspartic acid substitution at residue 833 (G833D) in eight unrelated patients and another A2659T change resulting in a glutamine to histidine substitution at residue 837 (Q837H) in one patient (Figure 1a and b). All of the patients with the G833D mutation had a large disfiguring lesion affecting one side of the face, and associated early postoperative recurrence, whereas the patient with the Q837H mutation had no recurrence during postoperative follow-up after 5 years. However, the Q837H tumour comprised large dilated thin-walled vessels lined with flattened endothelium (Figure 1f). Although the expression of Tie2 protein was moderate in Q837H-tumour ECs, the expression of VEGF protein was unable to be detected (data not shown). Pathological evaluation revealed that the G833D tumours were IMHs of the capillary type, whereas the Q837H lesion was an IMH of the cavernous type. G833DTie2 showed a 2.9fold increase in ligand-independent autophosphorylation relative to wild-type Tie2, whereas Q837HTie2 showed Mutation of Tie2 gene in IMHs H Wang et al 8701 Figure 1 Tie2 mutations in human intramuscular haemangiomas. (f) Q837H tumour from case 2980 exhibits significant dilated and thin-walled blood vessels (arrowheads). Consistent with their ligandindependent phosphorylation, Q837HTie2 stimulated activation of STAT3 more strongly than G833DTie2. These data indicate that the G833D and Q837H mutations in Tie2 result in ligand-independent hyperphosphorylation of the receptor and promote the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3. Western blot analysis showed that there was no significant difference in Tie2 protein expression among MSS31G833D, MSS31Q837H, and MSS31wild-type cells (Figure 2e). The morphology of MSS31 cells transfected with G833D, Q837H, wild-type Tie2, or vector MSS31Q837H, MSS31wild-type, or (MSS31G833D, MSS31vector, respectively) was similar to the morphology of primary ECs in culture. However, MSS31G833D growth was significantly faster, and MSS31wild-type growth was significantly slower when compared with MSS31vector or MSS31Q837H when cultured with 0.5% serum (Figure 2f). In vivo studies showed that all 10 mice inoculated with 5 106 MSS31G833D cells produced tumours after 813 weeks (Figure 3a), whereas mice inoculated with the same number of MSS31Q837H, MSS31wild-type, or MSS31vector cells did not develop tumours. Either the G833D or Q837H mutation was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the Altered Sites II Mammalian Mutagenesis System (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA). MSS31Q837H (&), MSS31vector (E), and MSS31wild-type (W) had doubling times of 4773.98, 5474.04, and 6875.49 h, respectively, whereas MSS31G833D (J) proliferated with a doubling time of 33.271.47 h. The doubling time of MSS31G833D growth was significantly shorter, whereas the doubling time of MSS31wild-type was significantly longer when compared with MSS31vector or MSS31Q837H. Northern Oncogene blot analysis showed that there was no significant difference in Tie2 mRNA expression among MSS31G833D, MSS31Q837H, and MSS31wild-type cells. However, MSS31G833D cells expressed more VEGF mRNA than MSS31wild-type or MSS31Q837H cells when cultured with 0.5% serum. *Location of the two missense mutations The G833D mutation occurs at the second glycine residue of the GXGXXG motif (residues 832835) within the nucleotide-binding loop, whereas Q837H affects the glutamine adjacent to the third glycine. In the present study, we identified two point mutations in the Tie2 kinase domain from 37 haemangioma samples: a G2646A change resulting in a glycine to aspartic acid substitution at residue 833 (G833D) in eight unrelated patients and another A2659T change resulting in a glutamine to histidine substitution at residue 837 (Q837H) in one patient (Figure 1a and b). Empty mammalian expression vectors or vectors carrying full-length cDNA encoding the G2646A or A2659T mutation, or normal Tie2 cDNA, were transfected into MSS31 using the calcium phosphate method.

11672423	Enzymic activity was not affected in the DYRK1A-Y111F mutant. Two constructs had a strongly reduced content of immunoreactive phosphotyrosine : no phosphotyrosine could be detected in GST-DYRK1A-C-Y111F, and immunoreactivity was reduced by 64.3p9.6 % in GST-DYRK1A-C-Y104F (meanpS.D. Phosphotyrosine was clearly detected in wild-type DYRK1A and DYRK1A-Y111F, but not in DYRK1A-K188R and DYRK1A-Y321F, indicating that the kinase activity of DYRK1A is required for its tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast with bacterially expressed GSTDYRK1A-Y111F, immunochemically detectable phosphotyrosine was not reduced in GFP-DYRK1A-Y111F. GFPDYRK1A-Y111F was also indistinguishable from the wild-type construct in its subcellular localization, as determined by fluorescence microscopy, and in its catalytic activity towards DYRKtide (results not shown). Two constructs had a strongly reduced content of immunoreactive phosphotyrosine : no phosphotyrosine could be detected in GST-DYRK1A-C-Y111F, and immunoreactivity was reduced by 64.3p9.6 % in GST-DYRK1A-C-Y104F (meanpS.D. The reduced immunoreactivity of GST-DYRK1A-C-Y104F suggests that the presence of Tyr-104 is necessary for efficient phosphorylation of Tyr111. Increased immunoreactivity with one of the antibodies (PY20) was observed in GST-DYRK1A-C-Y112F, probably due to improved binding of this specific monoclonal antibody to the neighbouring phospho-Tyr-111. Both antibodies detected a truncated fragment of about 4045 kDa, corresponding to protein containing GST and the N-terminal domain of DYRK1A, which was labelled much more strongly in DYRK1A-C-Y112F than in the other constructs. For quantitative evaluation, immunoreactive bands were detected with "#&I-labelled Protein A, and the bound radioactivity # 2001 Biochemical Society RESULTS Tyr-321 in the activation loop is required for full activity of DYRK1A In order to assess the role of the tyrosines in the activation loop for enzymic activity of DYRK1A, point mutants of DYRK1A (Y319F, Y321F and Y319FY321F) were expressed in E. Indeed, surprisingly, DYRK1A-Y319F exhibited enhanced kinase activity towards the peptide substrate, but not in MBP assays. Except for this result, qualitatively similar results were obtained with both substrates (Figure 1), although the kinase activity of DYRK1AY321F and DYRK1A-Y319FY321F was more strongly reduced in the MBP assay (15 % of wild-type activity) than with DYRKtide (39 %). Notably, significant amounts of phosphotyrosine were detected in DYRK1A-Y319FY321F. MS Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gel bands containing GFPDYRK1A, GST-DYRK1A-C and GST-DYRK1A-CK188R (unphosphorylated control) were excised, cut into smaller pieces and washed for 15 min in water on a vortex-mixer. DYRK1A-K188R was included as a mutant with markedly reduced kinase activity [1]. The lack of immunoreactivity of the kinase-negative construct, DYRK1AK188R, provides evidence for the specificity of the antibody. For each phosphorylation site discovered above, only the unphosphorylated peptides were identified in the kinase-negative mutant DYRK1A-C-K188R. Phosphotyrosine was clearly detected in wild-type DYRK1A and DYRK1A-Y111F, but not in DYRK1A-K188R and DYRK1A-Y321F, indicating that the kinase activity of DYRK1A is required for its tyrosine phosphorylation. Immunochemically detected phosphorylation of Tyr-111 was not only abolished by the inactivating K188R mutation, but was also reduced in DYRK1A-Y321F, which exhibited reduced kinase activity. For quantitative evaluation, immunoreactive bands were detected with "#&I-labelled Protein A, and the bound radioactivity # 2001 Biochemical Society RESULTS Tyr-321 in the activation loop is required for full activity of DYRK1A In order to assess the role of the tyrosines in the activation loop for enzymic activity of DYRK1A, point mutants of DYRK1A (Y319F, Y321F and Y319FY321F) were expressed in E. Except for this result, qualitatively similar results were obtained with both substrates (Figure 1), although the kinase activity of DYRK1AY321F and DYRK1A-Y319FY321F was more strongly reduced in the MBP assay (15 % of wild-type activity) than with DYRKtide (39 %). Notably, significant amounts of phosphotyrosine were detected in DYRK1A-Y319FY321F. Accordingly, the reduced amount of immunologically detectable phosphotyrosine in DYRK1AY321F and DYRK1A-Y319321F correlated well with the reduced kinase activity of these mutants (Figure 1). Phosphotyrosine was clearly detected in wild-type DYRK1A and DYRK1A-Y111F, but not in DYRK1A-K188R and DYRK1A-Y321F, indicating that the kinase activity of DYRK1A is required for its tyrosine phosphorylation. Immunochemically detected phosphorylation of Tyr-111 was not only abolished by the inactivating K188R mutation, but was also reduced in DYRK1A-Y321F, which exhibited reduced kinase activity. 
12594213	Wild-type EGFR and EGFR-T766M mutant were preincubated with the indicated concentrations of PD153035 and then subjected to in vitro kinase assays using G6PDH as a substrate. C, CHO-K1 cells were transiently transfected with either empty vector or pLXSN expression plasmids encoding EGFR, EGFR-T766I, or EGFR-T766M. EGFR in Vitro Kinase Assay--CHO-K1 cells were transiently transfected in 10-cm dishes with 12 g of either pRK5-EGFR or pRK5-EGFRT766M expression plasmid and 36 l of LipofectAMINE. The resulting EGFR-T766M mutant and wild-type EGFR were transiently expressed in CHO-K1 cells and isolated by immunoprecipitation. Characterization of PD153035-insensitive EGFRT766M in stably transfected fibroblasts. A, control-infected EF1.1 / fibroblasts devoid of EGFR expression or EF1.1 / cells stably expressing either wild-type EGFR or the EGFR-T766M mutant were serum-starved for 24 h. B, serumstarved EF1.1 cells expressing either wild-type EGFR or the EGFRT766M mutant were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of EGF for 5 min prior to cell lysis. C, after serum starvation, EGFRand EGFR-T766M-expressing EF1.1 fibroblasts were treated for the indicated times with 10 ng/ml EGF. In addition to the EGFR-T766M mutant, we also replaced Thr-766 of the EGFR by isoleucine to analyze the amino acid substitution equivalent to that found in STI571insensitive BCR-ABL. Signaling capacity of PD153035-insensitive EGFR-T766M. Control-infected EF1.1 / fibroblasts devoid of EGFR expression or EF1.1 / cells stably expressing either wild-type EGFR or the EGFR-T766M mutant were serum-starved for 24 h. C, total cell lysates from EF1.1 / fibroblasts stably expressing either wild-type EGFR or the EGFR-T766M mutant were resolved by gel electrophoresis and then analyzed by immunoblotting with monoclonal anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody. In stark contrast, 1000-fold higher concentrations of PD153035 only partially reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR-T766I and had no inhibitory effect on the T766M mutant. As evident for the T766M mutant, desensitization to PD153035 was even more pronounced under the physiologically relevant cellular conditions than observed in our in vitro kinase assay. 1D, the EGFR-T766V mutant exhibited an 10-fold reduced sensitivity to PD153035 inhibition compared with wild-type receptor, indicating that the hydroxyl group of Thr-766 is important for inhibitor binding but that its absence can only partially account for the dramatic EGFR resistance formation observed for the T766I and T766M mutants. To test whether these mitogenic signals can be mediated through the EGFR-T766M mutant generated by the equivalent C to T single nucleotide mutation as previously found in STI571-resistant BCR-ABL Drug-resistant EGF Receptor from advanced CML patients (7), we utilized retroviral gene transfer to stably express either wild-type EGFR or the T766M mutant in immortalized EF1.1 / fibroblasts derived from EGFR knockout mice (23). 3, A and B, EGF-induced SHC and Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation was abrogated when cells expressing wild-type EGFR were preincubated with 1 M PD153035, whereas neither signaling event was affected in fibroblasts expressing the EGFR-T766M mutant upon inhibitor pretreatment. We next examined whether the EGFR-T766M could also trigger MAPK signal transduction and gene expression in a PD153035-insensitive manner. 3C, micromolar concentrations of PD153035 abrogated ERK phosphorylation in wild-type EGFR but not in EGFR-T766M-expressing fibroblasts. To quantify how the anti-proliferative effect of a specific quinazoline inhibitor is diminished if EGFR had acquired drug resistance, we performed thymidine incorporation assays to measure the EGF-mediated proliferative responses in both wild-type and T766M mutant EGFR-expressing cell lines. EF1.1 / fibroblasts stably expressing either wild-type EGFR or the EGFRT766M mutant were serum-starved for 24 h. Reconstitution of PD153035-suppressed ERK MAPK activation by co-expression of EGFR-T766M. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3-HA-ERK2 expression plasmid (0.25 g/well) plus either empty expression vector or pLXSN expression plasmids encoding EGFR or EGFR-T766M (0.25 g/well). 4), whereas halfmaximal inhibition of EGF-triggered thymidine incorporation through the EGFR-T766M mutant occurred at about 50-fold higher PD153035 concentrations of around 2.5 M. Because even up to 10 M of the inhibitor were without effect on EGFRT766M tyrosine phosphorylation in intact cells, this finding reveals that cellular targets of PD153035 distinct from EGFR are involved in EGF-triggered cell cycle progression. D, serum-starved CHO-K1 cells transiently expressing either wild-type EGFR or EGFR-T766V were preincubated with the indicated concentrations of PD153035 for 15 min prior to stimulation with 10 ng/ml EGF. To analyze this issue, we replaced Thr-766 by a valine residue of similar size and compared EGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of wild-type EGFR and the T766V mutant in transiently transfected CHO-K1 cells. 1D, the EGFR-T766V mutant exhibited an 10-fold reduced sensitivity to PD153035 inhibition compared with wild-type receptor, indicating that the hydroxyl group of Thr-766 is important for inhibitor binding but that its absence can only partially account for the dramatic EGFR resistance formation observed for the T766I and T766M mutants. C, CHO-K1 cells were transiently transfected with either empty vector or pLXSN expression plasmids encoding EGFR, EGFR-T766I, or EGFR-T766M. In stark contrast, 1000-fold higher concentrations of PD153035 only partially reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR-T766I and had no inhibitory effect on the T766M mutant. 1D, the EGFR-T766V mutant exhibited an 10-fold reduced sensitivity to PD153035 inhibition compared with wild-type receptor, indicating that the hydroxyl group of Thr-766 is important for inhibitor binding but that its absence can only partially account for the dramatic EGFR resistance formation observed for the T766I and T766M mutants.

In contrast to the results described above for the single mutants C278A and C342A, the double mutant (C278A, C342A), affecting the Ig-3 disulfide bond, also lacked transforming activity. As described above, single mutations affecting either partner of the Ig-3 disulfide bond, such as C278A and C278F or C342A and C342Y, resulted in efficient receptor activation, whereas simultaneous mutation of both residues to Ala, creating the double mutant (C278A, C342A), resulted in a nontransforming derivative (Fig. (E) (C278A, C342A).

Whereas each of the single mutants W290G and T341P was transforming, as described above, transforming activity was completely lost when these single mutants were combined with the double mutant (C278A, C342A) (Figs. The inactivity of the resulting triple mutants (W290G, C278A, C342A) and also (T341P, C278A, C342A), clearly indicates a requirement for the Ig-3 cysteine residues in these craniosynostosis syndromes that do not directly create or destroy a cysteine residue. 3A, lanes 3 and 4), in contrast to either wild-type FGFR2 or the double mutant (C278A, C342A), which exist primarily in the monomeric form (Fig. Lanes: 1, mock-transfected cells; 2, wild type; 3, C278F; 4, C342Y; 5, (C278A, C342A); 6, W290G; 7, (W290G, C278A, C342A); 8, T341P; 9, (T341P, C278A, C342A).

To address whether activation of the receptor can be accomplished by mutations affecting individual cysteine residues in the Ig domains, chimeric receptors containing each of the single mutations C62A, C107A, C179A, C231A, C278A, and C342A were constructed (Fig. Although the C107A mutant was inactive, the C62A mutant exhibited modest activation, indicating that activating mutations might occur in the Ig-1 domain. The double mutants (C62A, C107A) and (C179A, C231A), affecting the Ig-1 and Ig-2 domains, respectively, were inactive in transformation assays. The only Cys 3 Ala mutation in either the Ig-1 or Ig-2 domains that resulted in receptor activation was C62A, which would leave Cys-107 unpaired and potentially available for aberrant dimerization. Within this region, mutations in FGFR1 cause Pfeiffer syndrome (P252R), and mutations in FGFR2 cause Apert syndrome (S252W and P253R), whereas mutations in FGFR3 cause nonsyndromic craniosynostosis (P250R) (13, 16, 34, 35). We examined the effect of two of these mutations, W290G and T341P, on receptor dimerization and activation. Interestingly, transformation by the chimeric receptors, dimerization, and enhanced kinase activity were all abolished if either the W290G or the T341P mutation was expressed in conjunction with mutations that eliminate the disulfide bond in the third immunoglobulin-like domain (Ig-3).

(E) The noncysteine craniosynostosis mutation W290G. Among the noncysteine craniosynostosis mutations shown in Table 1C, we chose the mutations W290G and T341P identified in patients with Crouzon or Pfeiffer syndrome, respectively, for further analysis. When the single mutants W290G and T341P were assayed as chimeric FGFR2 Neu receptors (Fig. (F) W290G. (G) (W290G, C278A, C342A). We next combined the double mutant (C278A, C342A) with each of the noncysteine craniosynostosis mutants examined in this study, W290G and T341P. Whereas each of the single mutants W290G and T341P was transforming, as described above, transforming activity was completely lost when these single mutants were combined with the double mutant (C278A, C342A) (Figs. The inactivity of the resulting triple mutants (W290G, C278A, C342A) and also (T341P, C278A, C342A), clearly indicates a requirement for the Ig-3 cysteine residues in these craniosynostosis syndromes that do not directly create or destroy a cysteine residue. Both of the noncysteine mutants, W290G and T341P, also exhibited dimer formation (Fig. However, when each of the mutants W290G and T341P was combined 4570 Medical Sciences: Robertson et al.

The mutation W290G involves the substitution of a large hydrophobic residue by glycine, which likely causes conformational changes that would disrupt the disulfide bond. The mutations W290G and T341P were examined in this study. By using similar chimeric receptors, we show herein that the mutations W290G and T341P, in the extracellular domain of FGFR2, resulted in activation of the receptor. In addition to receptor activation, both the noncysteine mutations W290G and T341P show the same levels of receptor dimerization and activation of the kinase domain as the cysteine mutations C278F and C342Y. The craniosynostosis mutations found in the structural region around W290 includes the point mutations W290G examined herein, as well as W290R, Q289P, and the deletion H287 Q289. Some of these mutations (Table 1A), such as C278F or C342Y, destroy one of the cysteine residues forming the disulfide bond in the Ig-3 domain, leaving the other cysteine potentially unpaired to participate in intermolecular disulfide bonding.

As a control, we included the single mutants, C278F and C342Y, that have been identified in patients with Crouzon and Pfeiffer syndromes. 1 E and F), both resulted in NIH 3T3 transformation comparable to the single mutants, C278F and C342Y (Fig. As described above, single mutations affecting either partner of the Ig-3 disulfide bond, such as C278A and C278F or C342A and C342Y, resulted in efficient receptor activation, whereas simultaneous mutation of both residues to Ala, creating the double mutant (C278A, C342A), resulted in a nontransforming derivative (Fig. This suggested that transformation by each of the single mutants C278F and C342Y arises from retention of a single unpaired cysteine residue. (D) C342Y. Both of the single cysteine mutants, C278F and C342Y, formed dimers of approximately 220 kDa (Fig. Lanes: 1, mock-transfected cells; 2, wild type; 3, C278F; 4, C342Y; 5, (C278A, C342A); 6, W290G; 7, (W290G, C278A, C342A); 8, T341P; 9, (T341P, C278A, C342A).

The extent of this activation was comparable to the activation observed for the Crouzon Pfeiffer syndrome mutations, C278F and C342Y, which are representative of those craniosynostosis syndrome mutations that involve the loss of a cysteine residue (Table 1A). In addition to receptor activation, both the noncysteine mutations W290G and T341P show the same levels of receptor dimerization and activation of the kinase domain as the cysteine mutations C278F and C342Y. To address whether activation of the receptor can be accomplished by mutations affecting individual cysteine residues in the Ig domains, chimeric receptors containing each of the single mutations C62A, C107A, C179A, C231A, C278A, and C342A were constructed (Fig. Although the C107A mutant was inactive, the C62A mutant exhibited modest activation, indicating that activating mutations might occur in the Ig-1 domain. The double mutants (C62A, C107A) and (C179A, C231A), affecting the Ig-1 and Ig-2 domains, respectively, were inactive in transformation assays. To address whether activation of the receptor can be accomplished by mutations affecting individual cysteine residues in the Ig domains, chimeric receptors containing each of the single mutations C62A, C107A, C179A, C231A, C278A, and C342A were constructed (Fig. Furthermore, mutations affecting the cysteine residues that stabilize the Ig-3 domain, C278A and C342A, efficiently transformed NIH 3T3 cells when assayed as chimeric FGFR2 Neu receptors. In contrast to the results described above for the single mutants C278A and C342A, the double mutant (C278A, C342A), affecting the Ig-3 disulfide bond, also lacked transforming activity. As described above, single mutations affecting either partner of the Ig-3 disulfide bond, such as C278A and C278F or C342A and C342Y, resulted in efficient receptor activation, whereas simultaneous mutation of both residues to Ala, creating the double mutant (C278A, C342A), resulted in a nontransforming derivative (Fig. (E) (C278A, C342A). (G) (W290G, C278A, C342A). (I) (T341P, C278A, C342A). We next combined the double mutant (C278A, C342A) with each of the noncysteine craniosynostosis mutants examined in this study, W290G and T341P. Whereas each of the single mutants W290G and T341P was transforming, as described above, transforming activity was completely lost when these single mutants were combined with the double mutant (C278A, C342A) (Figs. The inactivity of the resulting triple mutants (W290G, C278A, C342A) and also (T341P, C278A, C342A), clearly indicates a requirement for the Ig-3 cysteine residues in these craniosynostosis syndromes that do not directly create or destroy a cysteine residue. 3A, lanes 3 and 4), in contrast to either wild-type FGFR2 or the double mutant (C278A, C342A), which exist primarily in the monomeric form (Fig. Lanes: 1, mock-transfected cells; 2, wild type; 3, C278F; 4, C342Y; 5, (C278A, C342A); 6, W290G; 7, (W290G, C278A, C342A); 8, T341P; 9, (T341P, C278A, C342A).

We examined the effect of two of these mutations, W290G and T341P, on receptor dimerization and activation. Interestingly, transformation by the chimeric receptors, dimerization, and enhanced kinase activity were all abolished if either the W290G or the T341P mutation was expressed in conjunction with mutations that eliminate the disulfide bond in the third immunoglobulin-like domain (Ig-3). We also examined FGFR2 activation in response to two of the noncysteine mutations in the Ig-3 domain, W20G and T341P. (F) The noncysteine craniosynostosis mutation T341P. Among the noncysteine craniosynostosis mutations shown in Table 1C, we chose the mutations W290G and T341P identified in patients with Crouzon or Pfeiffer syndrome, respectively, for further analysis. When the single mutants W290G and T341P were assayed as chimeric FGFR2 Neu receptors (Fig. (H) T341P. (I) (T341P, C278A, C342A). We next combined the double mutant (C278A, C342A) with each of the noncysteine craniosynostosis mutants examined in this study, W290G and T341P. Whereas each of the single mutants W290G and T341P was transforming, as described above, transforming activity was completely lost when these single mutants were combined with the double mutant (C278A, C342A) (Figs. The inactivity of the resulting triple mutants (W290G, C278A, C342A) and also (T341P, C278A, C342A), clearly indicates a requirement for the Ig-3 cysteine residues in these craniosynostosis syndromes that do not directly create or destroy a cysteine residue. Both of the noncysteine mutants, W290G and T341P, also exhibited dimer formation (Fig. However, when each of the mutants W290G and T341P was combined 4570 Medical Sciences: Robertson et al.

Similarly, the T341P mutation would alter the -strand containing Cys-342, which would be expected to disrupt its bonding with Cys-278. The mutations W290G and T341P were examined in this study. By using similar chimeric receptors, we show herein that the mutations W290G and T341P, in the extracellular domain of FGFR2, resulted in activation of the receptor. In addition to receptor activation, both the noncysteine mutations W290G and T341P show the same levels of receptor dimerization and activation of the kinase domain as the cysteine mutations C278F and C342Y. Craniosynostosis mutations in this region include G338R, G338E, Y340H, T341P, A344P, and A344G, and the deletion G345P361, all of which lie on the -strand containing Cys-342. Some of these mutations (Table 1A), such as C278F or C342Y, destroy one of the cysteine residues forming the disulfide bond in the Ig-3 domain, leaving the other cysteine potentially unpaired to participate in intermolecular disulfide bonding.

Both of the single cysteine mutants, C278F and C342Y, formed dimers of approximately 220 kDa (Fig. Lanes: 1, mock-transfected cells; 2, wild type; 3, C278F; 4, C342Y; 5, (C278A, C342A); 6, W290G; 7, (W290G, C278A, C342A); 8, T341P; 9, (T341P, C278A, C342A).

The extent of this activation was comparable to the activation observed for the Crouzon Pfeiffer syndrome mutations, C278F and C342Y, which are representative of those craniosynostosis syndrome mutations that involve the loss of a cysteine residue (Table 1A). In addition to receptor activation, both the noncysteine mutations W290G and T341P show the same levels of receptor dimerization and activation of the kinase domain as the cysteine mutations C278F and C342Y.

11923305	For the S202A mutation, an EclXI-HindIII fragment containing the mutation and the downstream coding sequence was prepared by PCR using pNTPTP as a template with the 5 -primer 5 CCAACGGCCGCACTGAGGATGTGGAGCCCCAGAGTGTGCCACTTCTGGCCAGAGCCCCA-3 and the 3 -primer 5 -TGTTGAAGCTTACTTGAAGTTGGCATAATC-3 . The mutation TCC 3 GCC (boldface italics) in the 5 -primer resulted in the S202A substitution. This PCR product was digested with EclXI and HindIII, mixed with the 0.57-kilobase pair gel-purified HindIII-EclXI restriction fragment from pNTPTP , and ligated into the HindIII site of pTet-Splice to make plasmid pNTPTP (S202A). A mutant that contained a S202A mutation transformed like WT PTP . Cell Lines, Nocodazole Arrest of Mitotic Cells, and Induction of PTP Expression--Except for cell lines overexpressing the S180A and S204A mutants (described below), all lines were previously described (13). For the S180A substitution, a mutated HindIII-EclXI fragment was prepared by PCR using pNTPTP as a template with the 5 -primer 5 -CGCCAAGCTTG- GCCACCATGGATTCCTGGTTCATTCTTGT-3 and the 3 -primer 5 CAGTGCGGCCGTTGGATAAGCGGAAAGCATTGGAAT-3 . The substitution AGA 3 AGC (boldface italics) in the 3 -primer resulted in the S180A substitution. This PCR product was cleaved with HindIII and EclXI, mixed with the complementary gel-purified EclXI-HindIII restriction fragment from pNTPTP , and ligated into the HindIII site of pTetSplice to make plasmid pNTPTP (S180A). Plasmid pTPTP (S180A), which expresses PTP (S180A)-HA, was constructed similarly, except that the EclXI-HindIII fragment was from pTPTP . To construct the PTP (S180A/S204A) expression plasmid, the 0.56-kilobase pair gel-purified HindIII-EclXI fragment from pNTPTP (S180A) was mixed with the gel-purified EclXI-HindIII fragment from pNTPTP (S204A) and ligated into pTet-Splice to make plasmid pNTPTP (S180A/S204A). Plasmid pTPTP (S180A/ S204A), which expresses the HA-tagged double mutant, was constructed similarly, except that the EclXI-HindIII restriction fragment was isolated from pTPTP (S204A). To see if we could detect serine phosphates added during mitosis, unsynchronized and nocodazole-arrested mitotic WT PTP and PTP (S180A/S204A) overexpresser cells were labeled in vivo with [32P]orthophosphate, and the radiolabeled proteins were analyzed by anti-PTP immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and autoradiography. WT PTP and PTP (S180A/S204A) from unsynchronized and mitotic cells displayed similar radioactive phosphoamino acid compositions: a significant excess of phosphoserine over phosphotyrosine and very little or no phosphothreonine (data not shown). Both coordinate and separate S180A and/or S204A muta- FIG. Approximately equal amounts of overexpressed human WT PTP -HA, PTP (S180A/S204A)-HA, PTP (S180A)HA, and PTP (S204A)-HA were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody from lysates from NIH3T3-derived overexpresser cells that were either unsynchronized (U) or arrested in mitosis (M). Additional experiments were performed similarly, except that the WT PTP and PTP (S180A/S204A) immunoprecipitates were preincubated with PP2A, a Ser/Thr phosphatase, and then washed with phosphatase buffer before incubation with MBP. D, experiments were performed as described above using immunoprecipitated WT PTP -HA or PTP (S180A/S204A)-HA, except that the immunoprecipitates were preincubated with ( ) or without ( ) PP2A prior to PTP assay with 32P-labeled MBP. The mitotic mobility retardation was completely blocked in PTP (S180A/S204A), consistent with the hypothesis that the retardation resulted from mitotic phosphorylation at these sites. Similar experiments were conducted with immunoprecipitated WT PTP and PTP (S180A/S204A) that had been incubated with the Ser/Thr phosphatase PP2A before incubation with MBP. Phosphatase-treated WT PTP from both unsynchronized and mitotic cells had the same very low Src-activating ability as untreated PTP (S180A/S204A) (Fig. Moreover, PP2A treatment did not affect PTP (S180A/S204A) (Fig. B, the conditions were the same as described for A, except that immunopurified WT PTP (lanes 1 4) and PTP (S180A/ S204A) (lanes 5 8) were treated ( ; lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8) or not ( ; lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6) with PP2A prior to incubation with Src. In contrast, we now found that overexpression of the mutants with S180A and/or S204A substitutions had no effect on Src tyrosine phosphorylation or activity (Fig. The expression levels in the WT and mutant overexpresser cells were the same, except for the S180A mutant, which was expressed at an 50% higher level. In contrast, PTP with either the S180A and/or S204A mutation did not detectably bind Src in either unsynchronized or mitotic cells (Fig. Effect of Ser180 and Ser204 Mutations and PP2A Treatment on PTP Binding to the Isolated Src and Grb2 SH2 Domains--To determine whether the changes in PTP -Grb2 association could be explained by changes in the affinity of the Grb2 or Src SH2 domain alone, we measured the abilities of fusion proteins containing GST and either Grb2 or Src SH2 domains to affinity-precipitate WT PTP -HA and PTP (S180A/S204A)-HA from overexpresser cell lysates (Fig. We now found that the Ser-to-Ala mutations slightly increased ( 25%) the ratio between Grb2 and Src SH2 domain binding to interphase PTP and completely eliminated the mitotic changes in binding affinities; 3.7 0.5 times more PTP (S180A/S204A) bound to the Grb2 SH2 domain than to the Src SH2 domain (Fig. A, lysates (containing 400 g of total cell protein) from unsynchronized (U) or mitotic (M) WT PTP -HA (lanes 3 8) or PTP (S180A/S204A)-HA (lanes 1116) overexpresser cells were affinity-precipitated by incubation with GST (lanes 3, 4, 11, and 12), a GST-Grb2 SH2 domain fusion protein (lanes 5, 6, 13, and 14), or a GST-Src SH2 domain fusion protein (lanes 7, 8, 15, and 16) bound to Sepharose beads. Dephosphorylation affected WT PTP -HA binding in the same manner as the S180A and S204A mutations: it eliminated the mitotic decrease in the binding of PTP to the Grb2 SH2 domain and decreased the binding of interphase and mitotic PTP to the Src SH2 domain by 35 45%. We have now shown that S180A and/or S204A mutation blocks these effects and the resultant mitotic activation of Src by PTP . Thus, it is likely that the inability of PTP (S180A/S204A) to bind Src in vivo results, at least in part, from increased competition from Grb2. Even though its binding affinity is slightly reduced, PTP (S180A/S204A) still binds the Src SH2 domain (Fig. RESULTS We have previously described genetically modified NIH3T3 cell lines that inducibly overexpress (under repressive control of doxycycline) human WT PTP and PTP (Y789F) and the same proteins with a nine-residue HA tag at their C termini, designated PTP -HA and PTP (Y789F)-HA (13). The very low residual activity of the Ser-to-Ala mutants was similar to that of the Y789F mutant (Fig. Cell Lines, Nocodazole Arrest of Mitotic Cells, and Induction of PTP Expression--Except for cell lines overexpressing the S180A and S204A mutants (described below), all lines were previously described (13). For the S204A mutation, a 0.6-kilobase pair HindIII-BglII fragment containing the 5 -portion of the WT coding sequence was copied from pNTPTP by PCR using the 5 -primer 5 -CGCCAAGCTTGGCCACCATGGATTCCTGGTTCATTCTTGT-3 and the 3 -primer 5 -TTGGTGGCTGGAGATCTGGCCAGAAGTGGCACACTCT-3 . (Although the 3 -primer contained the substitution AGC 3 GGC at nucleotides 6 8, the BglII digestion removed this region.) The BglII-HindIII fragment containing the downstream coding sequence with the S204A mutation was generated using pNTPTP as a PCR template with the 5 -primer 5 -TGGCCAGATCTCCAGCCACCAACAGGAAATACCCACCCCT-3 and the 3 -primer 5 TGTTGAAGCTTACTTGAAGTTGGCATAATC-3 . The mutation AGC 3 GCC (boldface italics) in the 5 -primer caused the S204A substitution. This PCR product was cleaved with BglII and HindIII, and both fragments were ligated into the HindIII site of pTet-Splice to make plasmid pNTPTP (S204A). Plasmid pTPTP (S204A), which expresses PTP (S204A)-HA, was constructed by ligating the gel-purified HindIIIClaI restriction fragment from pNTPTP (S204A), containing the S204A mutation, along with the complementary gel-purified ClaIHindIII restriction fragment from pTPTP , containing the downstream WT PTP -HA sequence, into the HindIII site of pTet-Splice. To construct the PTP (S180A/S204A) expression plasmid, the 0.56-kilobase pair gel-purified HindIII-EclXI fragment from pNTPTP (S180A) was mixed with the gel-purified EclXI-HindIII fragment from pNTPTP (S204A) and ligated into pTet-Splice to make plasmid pNTPTP (S180A/S204A). Plasmid pTPTP (S180A/ S204A), which expresses the HA-tagged double mutant, was constructed similarly, except that the EclXI-HindIII restriction fragment was isolated from pTPTP (S204A).

However, this effect was completely abrogated with the CD4 mutants Q114A/F182A or F182A/F201A. This analysis clearly showed that F201 was the most important residue given that alanine substitution of 202205 (M4_36) had little effect, whereas the other four mutants, which included F201A, failed to restore T cell responsiveness to HEL 48 61. However, mutants consisting of F201A together with each of the other four mutants individually all restored function (M4_4750). Thus, F201 appeared to be the most important residue of those altered in the M4_10 mutant (as shown by M4_36), although other residues are clearly required as F201A alone has no effect.

These findings were confirmed by transient transfection of two -catenin point mutants, Tyr-654Phe and Tyr-654Glu, which, respectively, mimic the dephosphorylated and phosphorylated states of Tyr-654, a tyrosine residue contained within the -catenin-ErbB2-binding domain. Furthermore, these investigators observed that a Tyr-654Phe (Y654F) point mutant, which mimics an unphosphorylated tyrosine residue, bound E-cadherin in vitro with an affinity similar to that of wild-type -catenin, whereas a Tyr-654Glu (Y654E) point mutant, whose negative charge mimics a phosphorylated tyrosine residue, bound Ecadherin with less than one-tenth the affinity of wild-type -catenin. These findings were confirmed by transient transfection of two -catenin point mutants, Tyr-654Phe and Tyr-654Glu, which, respectively, mimic the dephosphorylated and phosphorylated states of Tyr-654, a tyrosine residue contained within the -catenin-ErbB2-binding domain.

Less frequently, FMTC is associated with changes in the N-terminal (E768D, L790F, Y791F, V804L, V804M) or C-terminal lobe (S891A) of the RET kinase. Accordingly, K603Q,12 M918T,13,14 and V804L15 point mutations have been described in such families. Less frequently, FMTC is associated with changes in the N-terminal (E768D, L790F, Y791F, V804L, V804M) or C-terminal lobe (S891A) of the RET kinase. We tested on thyroid follicular cells the transforming activity of RET(C634S), RET(K603Q), another mutant identified in a kindred with both PTC and MTC, RET(C634R) a commonly isolated allele in MEN2A, RET(M918T) responsible for MEN2B and also identified in kindreds with both PTC and MTC, and RET/ PTC1 the rearranged oncogene that characterizes bona fide PTC in patients without MTC. The identification of a novel family with affected siblings showing both MTC and PTC and carrying the RET(C634S) mutation, prompted us to analyze the transforming activity of RET(C634S), RET(K603Q), RET(C634R), and RET(M918T) in PC Cl 3 thyroid follicular cells. RET(C634S) and RET(K603Q) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A: Pedigree of the family displaying both MTC and PTC and carrying the RET C634S mutation. Furthermore, DNA sequencing of the RT-PCR products confirmed the expression of messenger RNAs containing the C634S mutation (not shown). All together, these findings demonstrate the expression of a RET allele carrying the C634S mutation in the PTC tissues of the patients. Biological Activity of RET Point Mutants in Thyroid Follicular Cells To verify whether RET point mutants exert transforming ability for thyroid follicular cells, we generated eukaryotic expression vectors for RET(C634R), RET(M918T), RET(C634S), RET(K603Q), and RET/PTC1 (Figure 3A). Thus, clones with comparable expression levels (K603Q-Cl.1, C634R-Cl.1, C634S-Cl.2, and M918T) were selected (Figure 3C). We tested on thyroid follicular cells the transforming activity of RET(C634S), RET(K603Q), another mutant identified in a kindred with both PTC and MTC, RET(C634R) a commonly isolated allele in MEN2A, RET(M918T) responsible for MEN2B and also identified in kindreds with both PTC and MTC, and RET/ PTC1 the rearranged oncogene that characterizes bona fide PTC in patients without MTC. Furthermore, one particular transgenic mice line bearing the RET(C634R) allele under the control of the calcitonin promoter developed both MTC and PTC.16 Finally, full-length RET proteins are expressed not only in MTC17 but also at low levels in PTC, regardless of the occurrence of RET rearrangements.18,19 Despite this data, the oncogenic activity of RET point mutants for epithelial thyroid follicular cells has never been investigated. The identification of a novel family with affected siblings showing both MTC and PTC and carrying the RET(C634S) mutation, prompted us to analyze the transforming activity of RET(C634S), RET(K603Q), RET(C634R), and RET(M918T) in PC Cl 3 thyroid follicular cells. The wild-type RET, RET/PTC1, RET(M918T), and RET(C634R) constructs have been described previously.23 RET/PTC1-JM was engineered by PCR inserting the intracellular juxtamembrane domain of RET (residues 658 to 712) between H4 (residues 1 to 101) and RET kinase (residues 713 to 1072). Biological Activity of RET Point Mutants in Thyroid Follicular Cells To verify whether RET point mutants exert transforming ability for thyroid follicular cells, we generated eukaryotic expression vectors for RET(C634R), RET(M918T), RET(C634S), RET(K603Q), and RET/PTC1 (Figure 3A). Thus, clones with comparable expression levels (K603Q-Cl.1, C634R-Cl.1, C634S-Cl.2, and M918T) were selected (Figure 3C). At comparable expression levels (Figure 5B), RET/PTC1-JM had levels of mitogenic activity that were intermediate between those exerted by RET/PTC1 and RET(C634R) (Figure 5C), proving that indeed JM exerts inhibitory activity. We tested on thyroid follicular cells the transforming activity of RET(C634S), RET(K603Q), another mutant identified in a kindred with both PTC and MTC, RET(C634R) a commonly isolated allele in MEN2A, RET(M918T) responsible for MEN2B and also identified in kindreds with both PTC and MTC, and RET/ PTC1 the rearranged oncogene that characterizes bona fide PTC in patients without MTC. Accordingly, K603Q,12 M918T,13,14 and V804L15 point mutations have been described in such families. The identification of a novel family with affected siblings showing both MTC and PTC and carrying the RET(C634S) mutation, prompted us to analyze the transforming activity of RET(C634S), RET(K603Q), RET(C634R), and RET(M918T) in PC Cl 3 thyroid follicular cells. RET(C634S) and RET(K603Q) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Biological Activity of RET Point Mutants in Thyroid Follicular Cells To verify whether RET point mutants exert transforming ability for thyroid follicular cells, we generated eukaryotic expression vectors for RET(C634R), RET(M918T), RET(C634S), RET(K603Q), and RET/PTC1 (Figure 3A). Biological activity of the K603Q mutant has never been reported. Thus, clones with comparable expression levels (K603Q-Cl.1, C634R-Cl.1, C634S-Cl.2, and M918T) were selected (Figure 3C). Less frequently, FMTC is associated with changes in the N-terminal (E768D, L790F, Y791F, V804L, V804M) or C-terminal lobe (S891A) of the RET kinase.

Point mutations in RET are found in virtually all MEN2 kindreds.4 Most MEN2B patients carry the M918T substitution in the P 1 loop of the RET kinase. Accordingly, K603Q,12 M918T,13,14 and V804L15 point mutations have been described in such families.

Thus, clones with comparable expression levels (K603Q-Cl.1, C634R-Cl.1, C634S-Cl.2, and M918T) were selected (Figure 3C). The results are representative of at least three independent assays (M918T cells are not shown). These findings are representative of at least three independent experiments (M918T cells are not shown). 
11046148	Immobilized GST fusion proteins of individual AIP4 WW domains were tested for their ability to precipitate from lysates of wild-type LMP2A (LMP2A WT) or Y60A/Y101A, Y101A, or Y60A LMP2A mutant proteins expressed transiently in DG75 B cells. Wild-type and PPPPY motif mutants (YY, wild type; AA, Y60A/Y101A; YA, Y101A; AY, Y60A) of a FLAG epitopetagged LMP2A mammalian expression vector were transfected into Cos-1 cells with either MYC epitope-tagged KIAA0439 or AIP4 expression vectors. (A) Wild type (YY) and PPPPY motif (AA, Y60A/ Y101A; YA, Y101A; AY, Y60A) mutants of a FLAG epitope-tagged LMP2A mammalian expression vector were transfected into Cos-1 cells with the T7 epitope-tagged Nedd4 expression vector. However, no interaction between LMP2A and the Nedd4 family proteins was observed in transfected cells when both PPPPY sites were changed to PPPPA (Y60A/Y101A). Substitution of Tyr101 alone in the C-terminal PPPPY motif (Y101A) resulted in a more modest decrease in LMP2A binding to Nedd4 family members. Each of the four AIP4 WW domains bound to wild-type LMP2A but not to the Y60A/Y101A mutant lacking both Tyr60 and Tyr101 in the two PPPPY motifs. WW domains 1 to 3 also bound to the LMP2A Y101A mutant, but binding of this mutant to WW domain 4 was markedly reduced. WW domains 1 and 2 still bound to the Y60A LMP2A mutant but less efficiently than to the wild-type protein or to the Y101A mutant, consistent with the in vivo data that the N-terminal PPPPY motif is more effective in binding AIP4 than is the C-terminal motif. Immobilized GST fusion proteins of individual AIP4 WW domains were tested for their ability to precipitate from lysates of wild-type LMP2A (LMP2A WT) or Y60A/Y101A, Y101A, or Y60A LMP2A mutant proteins expressed transiently in DG75 B cells. Wild-type and PPPPY motif mutants (YY, wild type; AA, Y60A/Y101A; YA, Y101A; AY, Y60A) of a FLAG epitopetagged LMP2A mammalian expression vector were transfected into Cos-1 cells with either MYC epitope-tagged KIAA0439 or AIP4 expression vectors. (A) Wild type (YY) and PPPPY motif (AA, Y60A/ Y101A; YA, Y101A; AY, Y60A) mutants of a FLAG epitope-tagged LMP2A mammalian expression vector were transfected into Cos-1 cells with the T7 epitope-tagged Nedd4 expression vector. However, no interaction between LMP2A and the Nedd4 family proteins was observed in transfected cells when both PPPPY sites were changed to PPPPA (Y60A/Y101A). Each of the four AIP4 WW domains bound to wild-type LMP2A but not to the Y60A/Y101A mutant lacking both Tyr60 and Tyr101 in the two PPPPY motifs. A derivative of AIP4 (C830A) containing an inactive Hect domain was prepared by PCR mutagenesis and authenticated by DNA sequencing. A FLAG epitope-tagged LMP2A mammalian expression vector was gene pulsed into DG75 cells with either a MYC epitope-tagged KIAA0439 C962S or AIP4 C830A expression vector. To test this possibility, we expressed either wild-type AIP4 or the C830A AIP4 mutant (which removes a Cys essential for HECT domain catalytic activity) in LMP2A-expressing C4 cells also transfected with Lyn and HA-tagged ubiquitin (Fig. Since the C830A protein can readily bind to LMP2A through its WW domains, it would be anticipated to have a dominant-negative function. Although wild-type AIP4 did not significantly increase Lyn ubiquitination, indicating that E3 activity is not limiting in this assay, the C830A dominant-negative mutant effectively blocked the appearance of ubiquitinated Lyn species. In addition, Syk ubiquitination is blocked in C4 cells expressing the C830A AIP4 mutant (Fig. Also transfected was wild-type AIP4 (WT) or an inactive form of AIP4 (C830A). The C830A AIP4 mutant likely acts as a dominant negative to poison the protein complexes required for Lyn ubiquitination. Surprisingly, we also found that Syk could undergo ubiquitination in C4 293 cells, in a fashion that was blocked by expression of the C830A AIP4 mutant. A hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (YPYDVPDY)tagged ubiquitin, T7 epitope-tagged Nedd4, and Nedd4 (C853S) expression vectors have been described previously (53). Mutation of the KIAA0439 Hect domain catalytic Cys to Ser (C962S) was accomplished by using PCR mutagenesis and was confirmed by DNA sequencing. A FLAG epitope-tagged LMP2A mammalian expression vector was gene pulsed into DG75 cells with either a MYC epitope-tagged KIAA0439 C962S or AIP4 C830A expression vector. 
11493470	NEOPLASIA The Kit-activating mutation D816V enhances stem cell factordependent chemotaxis Marcia L. Metcalfe The D816V mutation of c-kit has been detected in patients with mastocytosis. Because stem cell factor (SCF), the ligand for Kit (CD117 ), is a chemoattractant for CD117 cells and one feature of mastocytosis is an abnormal collection of mast cells in tissues derived from CD34 CD117 mast cell precursors, the hypothesis was considered that the D816V mutation would enhance chemotaxis of these precursor cells. Constructs encoding wild-type Kit or Kit bearing the D816V mutation were transfected into Jurkat cells, labeled with Calcein-AM, and migration to SCF assessed in the presence or absence of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Chemotaxis to SCF was enhanced in D816V transfectants compared to wild-type Kit transfectants (P < .002). Migration of both transfectants was inhibited by tyrosine kinase inhibitors, although D816V transfectants were more sensitive. Analysis of prechemotaxis and migrated cells showed that whereas less than 10% in the prechemotaxis sample had the D816V mutation, 40% to 80% of migrated cells had this mutation. These results demonstrate that the D816V Kit mutation enhances chemotaxis of CD117 cells, offering one explanation for increased mast cells observed in tissues of patients with mastocytosis. 2001;98:1195-1199) 2001 by The American Society of Hematology Introduction Signaling through Kit, the receptor for stem cell factor (SCF), is crucial for the proliferation of CD34 CD117 mast cell precursors as well as their subsequent migration into tissues where they differentiate into mast cells.1-8 Activating mutations in Kit (D816V and V560G; single-letter amino acid codes) have been described in the human mast cell leukemia cell line HMC-1.9 In addition, activating mutations corresponding to D816V in the murine mastocytoma cell line p815 (D814Y)10 and in the rat RBL-2H3 mast cell line (D817Y)11 have been identified. These mutations are associated with the constitutive tyrosine kinase activation and phosphorylation of Kit as well as cell proliferation in the absence of the Kit ligand, SCF.9,12-14 The D816V mutation first reported in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with mastocytosis with an associated hematologic disorder15,16 has now been found in the urticaria pigmentosa lesional skin of all adult patients and a subset of children with severe disease.17,18 Because mastocytosis is a disease characterized by increased mast cell numbers in the skin, spleen, liver, and bone marrow, and because the D816V mutation is associated with increased cell proliferation, it has been concluded that one effect of the mutation is to increase mast cell proliferation in patients with mastocytosis who have this mutation in hematopoietic lineage cells.15-18 However, increased proliferation of mast cell precursors alone would not appear to account for increased tissue mast cell numbers, particularly in the skin at sites of lesions of urticaria pigmentosa where the D816V mutation may be identified even in circumstances where it cannot be identified in marrow or peripheral blood. One alternative explanation would be a preferential accumulation of cells bearing the D816V mutation at these skin sites.19 We thus hypothesized that the D816V mutation in Kit enhances cell migration of CD34 CD117 circulating mast cell precursors over that observed dependent on wild-type Kit. As will be shown, the activating Kit mutation D816V does, as hypothesized, enhance cell migration to the Kit ligand, SCF. This enhanced migration was demonstrated both in transfected Jurkat cells encoding the D816V mutation and in CD34 CD117 circulating mast cell precursors isolated from patients with mastocytosis. Construction of plasmid complementary DNA3-kitD816V The vectors plasmid complementary DNA (pcDNA3)-kitwt and pAlter-kitwt were a kind gift from Dr L. Construction of pAlter-kitD816V was achieved by site-specific mutagenesis of the pAlter-kitwt vector using the oligonucleotide: 5 -CTA GCC AGA GTC ATC AAG AAT G-3 (mutated base is underlined) according to manufacturer's instructions (Altered Sites II in vitro Mutagenesis System, Promega, Madison, WI). The mutation was confirmed by sequencing of the pAlter-kitD816V vector using an ABI 310 Genetic Analyzer (PerkinElmer, Branchburg, NJ). A 443-bp AccIII, BglII fragment from the pAlter-kitD816V vector was subcloned into pcDNA3-kitwt creating pcDNA3-kitD816V. Jurkat cells (4.0 107/0.4 mL RPMI) were transiently transfected with 50 g pcDNA3kitwt, pcDNA3-kitD816V, and the vector pcDNA-3 by electroporation (250 V, 960 F capacitance, pulse time 29-30 ms) using a gene pulser (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). Determination of transfection efficiency by flow cytometric analysis Transfection efficiency of the D816V and wild-type Kit transfectants was assessed by measuring Kit (CD117 ) surface expression by flow cytometry. Isolation and culture of CD34 CD117 mast cell precursors from patients with mastocytosis Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 2 patients with indolent mastocytosis16 (collected by leukapheresis) and known to have the D816V mutation were obtained and processed after informed consent. Nested PCR, restriction digestion, and quantitation of D816V mutation by gel fluorescence imaging A 111-bp region of c-kit DNA spanning D816V was amplified by nested PCR. Control cell lines, HMC-1.1 (without the Kit D816V mutation) and HMC-1.2 (heterozygous for the Kit D816V mutation) were analyzed in parallel. The proportion of cells bearing the D816V mutation in both the starting and migrated cells was calculated following gel fluorescence imaging (Gel Expert, Nucleotech, San Carlos, CA) of the restriction enzyme digestion products. BLOOD, 15 AUGUST 2001 VOLUME 98, NUMBER 4 ACTIVATING Kit MUTATION D816V ENHANCES CHEMOTAXIS 1197 Figure 1. Flow cytometric analysis of Kit expression on wild-type Kit and D816V-transfected Jurkat cells. Transfection efficiency of D816V and wild-type Kit transfectants were compared with Jurkat cells transfected with the vector pcDNA-3 alone and the Kit-expressing cell line HMC-1.2. In contrast, migration of Jurkat cells to SDF-1 was comparable in the wild-type Kit and D816V transfectants, as well as in Jurkat cells transfected with the pcDNA-3 vector alone (Figure 2B). To determine whether the differences in migration to SCF observed between the D816V and wild-type Kit transfectants were due to random migration, we performed control chemokinesis experiments. The results confirmed that the enhanced migration observed in D816V transfectants was due mainly to chemotaxis and not chemokinesis, because significant random migration was not demonstrated when SCF was added either to the top well or to both the top and bottom wells of the chemotaxis chamber (Figure 2C). Results Assessment of transfection efficiency by flow cytometric analysis Because the D816V mutation results in constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase activity of Kit, we next assessed whether the enhanced migration displayed by D816V transfectants would be differentially effected by tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Migration to SCF of both the D816V and wild-type Kit transfectants was partially inhibited by both tyrosine kinase inhibitors Genistein and Tyrphostin AG 1296 (Figure 3). However, migration of the D816V transfectants was inhibited to a greater degree by both Genistein (100 M; 52% versus 33%; Figure 3A; P .009) and Tyrphostin AG 1296 (100 M; 53% versus 31%; Figure 3B; P .007) compared to the wild-type Kit transfectants (n 2). Preferential migration to SCF of mutant CD34 CD117 cells from patients with mastocytosis Efficiency of transfection was assessed by measuring CD117 expression on wild-type Kit and D816V-transfected Jurkat cells. There were similar percentages of CD117 expression on both the wild-type Kit (18% 1.8%, n 3) and the D816V (19% 1.3%, n 3) transfectants (Figure 1). SCF-dependent chemotaxis of transfected cells We next determined the chemotaxis responses of the wild-type Kit and D816V transfectants to SCF compared to SDF-1 (Figure 2). There was a significant enhancement of migration to SCF of the D816V transfectants, peaking at 18.2% 1.9% (n 3; 10 ng/mL) To determine whether these observations are clinically relevant in mastocytosis, we performed chemotaxis of CD34 CD117 cells from which mast cells are derived. Samples taken from 1- and 3-day cultures of CD34 CD117 cells from patients with mastocytosis were analyzed for the presence of the D816V mutation both in the starting prechemotaxis sample as well as 3 and 6 hours after chemotaxis.

Asterisks in panel A represent values that were significant at P .05 when migration of D816V and wild-type Kit transfectants were compared. (C) Comparison of chemokinesis in D816V (f), wild-type Kit ( ), and pcDNA-3 transfectants (p). This was first demonstrated in Jurkat cells (Figure 1) transfected with Kit bearing the D816V mutation. SCF induced a standard bell-shaped dose-dependent chemotactic response in both D816V and wild-type Kit transfectants (Figure 2A). However, SCF induced an enhanced chemotactic response in the D816V compared to the wild-type Kit transfectants. In contrast, there was comparable migration to SDF-1 (Figure 2B), the ligand for the endogenously expressed CXCR4 chemokine receptor in Jurkat cells transfected with the D816V, wild-type Kit, or pcDNA-3 vector. Moreover, control experiments confirmed that the differences in cell migration observed between the D816V and wild-type Kit transfectants were due mainly to chemotaxis and not chemokinesis although chemokinesis was enhanced to some degree in Jurkat cells expressing the Figure 3. The effect of tyrosine kinase inhibitors expressed both as percent migration and percent inhibition (A) Genistein (1-100 M) and (B) Tyrphostin AG1296 (1-100 M) on cell migration to SCF (10 ng/mL) in D816V (f), and wild-type Kit transfectants ( ). HinfI restriction digestion of the PCR product from the positive control HMC-1.2 (heterozygous for Kit D816V mutation) revealed 3 bands at 68, 54, and 43 bp (Figure 4B; the 14-bp band is not shown in this figure) confirming the presence of the mutation, whereas 2 bands were detected in the wild-type control cell line HMC-1.1 (without the Kit D816V mutation) at 68 and 43 bp. Mutant cells were below the limits of detection in the prechemotaxis day 1 and 3 cultured CD34 CD117 -enriched cells, consistent with published data on the presence of the D816V mutation in this cell population.22 However, analysis of PCR products from migrated cells at both 3 and 6 hours following HinfI digestion of CD34 CD117 cells revealed the presence of the mutation after chemotaxis in both 1- and 3-day cultures. Discussion The D816V mutation is the most commonly detected activating Kit mutation in patients with mastocytosis, a disease characterized by abnormal proliferation and subsequent accumulation of mast cells Figure 4. Preferential migration of CD34 CD117 cells with the D816V mutation. Predicted sizes for the sequence from the wild-type control cell line HMC-1.1 (without the kit D816V mutation) are 68 and 43 bp and for the positive control cell line HMC-1.2 (heterozygous for the Kit D816V mutation) are 68, 54, 43, and 14 bp. (B) Representative HinfI restriction digestion and quantification by gel fluorescence imaging of the D816V mutation in CD34 CD117 cells obtained from a patient with mastocytosis compared to control cell lines HMC-1.1 (wt) and HMC-1.2 (D816V) (the 14-bp band is not shown in this figure). CD34 CD117 cells were harvested after 1 and 3 days of culture and analyzed for the D816V mutation in the starting population and in the bottom chamber at 3 and 6 hours following chemotaxis to SCF (10 ng/mL). BLOOD, 15 AUGUST 2001 VOLUME 98, NUMBER 4 ACTIVATING Kit MUTATION D816V ENHANCES CHEMOTAXIS 1199 mutant compared to the wild-type Kit as would be expected (Figure 2C). To assess whether the enhanced tyrosine kinase activity conferred by the D816V mutation is responsible for the observed effects on chemotaxis, we compared the effect of tyrosine kinase inhibition on cell migration in both D816V and wild-type Kit transfectants (Figure 3). Although both transfectants were partially inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors Genistein and Tyrphostin AG1296, suggesting that both the wild-type and mutant transfectant use the same signal transduction pathway, the D816V transfectants were more sensitive to the inhibitory effect. This is consistent with evidence from murine studies that activating Kit mutations similarly enhance tyrosine kinase signaling.23-25 Previous work from our laboratory has similarly demonstrated that CD34 mast cell precursors from patients with mastocytosis are hypersensitive to SCF, in that CD34 precursors from patients with mastocytosis (when cultured in SCF) give rise to more mast cells per CD34 cell plated than when CD34 precursors are obtained from normal donors.26 To extend the observation of enhanced cell migration to SCF by the D816V transfectants to patients with mastocytosis, chemotaxis was performed on CD34 CD117 cells enriched from the peripheral blood of these patients. These results demonstrate preferential migration of CD34 CD117 mast cell precursors bearing the activating Kit mutation D816V to SCF and support our findings in transfected cells. In view of these data, we speculate that in patients with mastocytosis, CD34 CD117 mast cell precursor cells bearing the D816V mutation preferentially migrate to SCF produced by stroma cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and keratinocytes found in tissues such as the skin. Thus, enhanced cell migration in addition to aberrant proliferation, the other known effect of the D816V mutation, may contribute to the extensive mast cell hyperplasia observed in these tissues. In conclusion, our studies demonstrate enhanced migration of cells bearing the activating Kit mutation D816V both in a transfected cell model and in human hematopoietic mast cell progenitor cells isolated from patients with mastocytosis. 2001;98:1195-1199) 2001 by The American Society of Hematology Introduction Signaling through Kit, the receptor for stem cell factor (SCF), is crucial for the proliferation of CD34 CD117 mast cell precursors as well as their subsequent migration into tissues where they differentiate into mast cells.1-8 Activating mutations in Kit (D816V and V560G; single-letter amino acid codes) have been described in the human mast cell leukemia cell line HMC-1.9 In addition, activating mutations corresponding to D816V in the murine mastocytoma cell line p815 (D814Y)10 and in the rat RBL-2H3 mast cell line (D817Y)11 have been identified. 2001;98:1195-1199) 2001 by The American Society of Hematology Introduction Signaling through Kit, the receptor for stem cell factor (SCF), is crucial for the proliferation of CD34 CD117 mast cell precursors as well as their subsequent migration into tissues where they differentiate into mast cells.1-8 Activating mutations in Kit (D816V and V560G; single-letter amino acid codes) have been described in the human mast cell leukemia cell line HMC-1.9 In addition, activating mutations corresponding to D816V in the murine mastocytoma cell line p815 (D814Y)10 and in the rat RBL-2H3 mast cell line (D817Y)11 have been identified. 2001;98:1195-1199) 2001 by The American Society of Hematology Introduction Signaling through Kit, the receptor for stem cell factor (SCF), is crucial for the proliferation of CD34 CD117 mast cell precursors as well as their subsequent migration into tissues where they differentiate into mast cells.1-8 Activating mutations in Kit (D816V and V560G; single-letter amino acid codes) have been described in the human mast cell leukemia cell line HMC-1.9 In addition, activating mutations corresponding to D816V in the murine mastocytoma cell line p815 (D814Y)10 and in the rat RBL-2H3 mast cell line (D817Y)11 have been identified.

14522994	EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials, Plasmid Constructs, and Antibodies--Expression plasmids encoding the Nb2 form of the PRLR and the corresponding COOHterminal tyrosine to phenylalanine mutant form, Nb2PRLRY382F, as well as Jak2 were described previously (4). Approximately 5 105 cells were plated and then co-transfected (by calcium phosphate method) with expression plasmids encoding the Nb2 form of the PRLR, PRLRY382F, SHP-2WT, SHP-2CA, SOCS-1, ubiquitin, SOCS-1R105E, Stat-5, and Jak2 (0.11.0 g). For these studies, the human embryonic kidney 293 cells were transiently co-transfected with expression vectors encoding the wild type Nb2 form of the PRLR or the COOH-terminal tyrosine mutant form of the receptor in which tyrosine 382 was mutated to phenylalanine, PRLRY382F, along with expression vectors for Jak2 and SOCS-1. We next sought to determine whether protein degradation was specific to Jak2, and for that reason, 293 cells were transiently co-transfected with expression vectors encoding either the Nb2 PRLR or Nb2 PRLRY382F mutant along with expression vectors for SOCS-1 and Stat5. B, cellular lysates obtained from 293 cells that were transiently co-transfected with expression vectors for the Nb2 form of the PRLR or Nb2PRLRY382F mutant along with SOCS-1 and stimulated by PRL for the indicated time points were immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal antibody to Jak2. D, cellular lysates obtained from 293 cells that were transiently co-transfected with expression vectors for the Nb2 form of the PRLR or Nb2PRLRY382F mutant along with SOCS-1 and stimulated by PRL for the indicated time points. A, 293 cells were transiently co-transfected with the exception of the control sample (Ctl) with expression vectors for the Nb2 form of the PRLR (WT) or the corresponding COOH-terminal tyrosine mutant form PRLRY382F (YF) along with SOCS-1. Interestingly, more SOCS-1 protein was found to co-immunoprecipitate with Jak2 in samples overexpressing the PRLRY382F compared with samples overexpressing wild type PRLR. 293 cells were transiently co-transfected with expression vectors for the wild type Nb2 form of the PRLR or the COOH-terminal tyrosine mutant of the Nb2 form, PRLRY382F, along with expression vector for SOCS-1. 2D, the protein level of SOCS-1 decreases with time in the presence of PRLRY382F compared with PRLRWT. Expression plasmids encoding Myc-SOCS-1 and an SH2 domain-inactivating mutant form, Myc-SOCS-1R105E, were kindly provided by Akihiko Yoshimura (Life Sciences Institute, Kurume, Japan). Approximately 5 105 cells were plated and then co-transfected (by calcium phosphate method) with expression plasmids encoding the Nb2 form of the PRLR, PRLRY382F, SHP-2WT, SHP-2CA, SOCS-1, ubiquitin, SOCS-1R105E, Stat-5, and Jak2 (0.11.0 g). B, 293 cells that were co-transfected with expression vectors for the Nb2 form of the PRLR, Stat5, -galactosidase, -casein-lux reporter construct, and a combination of SOCS-1, the SH2 domain-inactivating mutant of SOCS-1, SOCS-1R105E, or the catalytically inactive SHP-2 mutant form, SHP-2CA, as indicated. To further confirm that SHP-2 contribution to PRLR signaling is mediated through the regulation of Jak2/SOCS-1 interaction, we used an SH2 domain-inactivating mutant form of SOCS-1, SOCS-1R105E (29), which blocks the recruitment of SOCS-1 to Jak2 in the functional luciferase assay system. We co-transfected 293 cells with expression plasmids encoding either SOCS-1 or SOCS-1R105E along with the Nb2 form of the PRLR, Stat5, SHP-2CA, -galactosidase, and the reporter construct -casein/lux. Furthermore, overexpression of SOCS-1R105E had no effect on PRL-mediated gene promoter activation, indicating that SOCS-1-mediated inhibition of PRLR signaling requires its SH2 domain as has been reported for other cytokine receptor systems (29). Significantly, co-overexpressing SHP-2CA with SOCS-1R105E restored luciferase activity, indicating that the ability of SHP-2CA to inhibit PRLR signaling requires a functional SH2 domain of SOCS-1. 293 cells were transiently cotransfected with expression vectors for the Nb2 form of the PRLR, SHP-2CA, with either SOCS-1 or SOCS-1R105E as indicated in Fig. Inhibition of Stat5 tyrosine phosphorylation was not observed in samples overexpressing SOCS-1R105E, indicating the essential role of the SH2 domain of SOCS-1 in mediating the inhibitory effects of SOCS-1. In contrast, co-overexpressing SHP-2CA together with SOCS-1R105E relieved the inhibitory effects of SHP-2CA on PRL-mediated Stat5 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. The capability of SOCS-1R105E to restore tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5 and -casein gene promoter activation downstream of the PRLR led us to examine the role of SOCS-1R105E in influencing the stability of Jak2. 6C, more Jak2 was observed in samples overexpressing SOCS-1R105E compared with samples overexpressing SOCS-1 wild type in the presence of either SHP-2WT or SHP-2CA. Interestingly, SOCS-1R105E appears also to be more stable compared with SOCS-1 wild type, suggesting that the degradation SOCS-1 requires a functional SH2 domain. Furthermore, we noticed that a shift in the molecular weight of SOCS-1R105E relative to SOCS-1 wild type could be due to change in charge2 as can be seen in the immunoblot using a polyclonal antibody to SOCS-1. combination of SOCS-1, SOCS-1R105E, or SHP-2CA were separated on SDS-PAGE and then immunodetected using a monoclonal antibody to phospho-Tyr-694 of Stat5, and the membrane was stripped and reprobed with a monoclonal antibody to Stat5 (right panel). C, 293 cells were transiently co-transfected with the expression vectors for PRLNb2, Jak2, SOCS-1, or SOCS-1R105E and SHP-2WT or SHP-2CA.

To confirm the presence of the Ala883Thr mutation, exon 15 was subjected to digestion using Alu I (Promega, Madison, WI) restriction enzyme. Pedigree of the studied family with new RET gene mutation Ala883Thr (GCT- ACT) showing the consanguinity of the parents of our index case. The analysis of the new Ala883Thr RET mutation in the family members revealed a heterozygous mutation in the 82-yr-old mother, son, and two sisters of the index case. Finally, one brother was found to be homozygous for the Ala883Thr mutation, as the index case. According to the distribution of RET polymorphisms and Ala883Thr mutation, we reconstructed the genotype of subject III:2 (Fig. This analysis indirectly confirmed the homozygous status of subjects IV:1 and IV:2 for Ala883Thr mutation. Finally, the results of transfection experiments indicated that the Ala883Thr mutation did not confer any detectable oncogenic activity to RET. Discussion We report here a germline mutation (Ala883Thr) of the RET gene that was associated with MTC phenotype exclusively in two homozygous subjects, whereas all heterozygous family members had no evidence of MTC. The exon 15 Ala883Thr mutation was never reported in the literature and FIG. Because the Ala883Thr RET mutation has never been described, there is no evidence that this mutation can lead to the development of the MTC in heterozygous condition. To our knowledge, a germline homozygous mutation of RET gene has been reported in only one family affected by FMTC harboring a Val804Met mutation (20). At variance with the novel RET mutation found in this study, the Val804Met mutation is well known as pathogenic for FMTC and characterized by a high degree of expression with a late onset of the disease whose clinical behavior is usually less aggressive (7, 21, 22). The wild-type RET and RET/C634R were kindly gifted by Dr. 
9748281	The rGrb14 mutation of the arginine 464 into lysine (rGrb14 R464K) was performed by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). As expected, the R464K mutated SH2 domain of rGrb14 no longer displays binding activity to insulin receptors. Surprisingly, the full-length rGrb14 mutant, which contains an R464K mutated and therefore inactive SH2 domain, displayed an interaction with insulin receptors that was similar to that of wild type rGrb14, as did the truncated rGrb14 deleted rGrb14 in Insulin Signaling 26031 FIG. rGrb14 Expression--Total RNA was purified from rat tissues or the adipocyte cell line 3T3-F442A using the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (30). Rat tissues and 3T3-F442A cells were homogenized in a sucrose buffer (250 mM sucrose, 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM pepstatin A, 10 M aprotinin, 10 g/ml leupeptin). In the adipose cell line 3T3-F442A, rGrb14 mRNA are absent in undifferentiated fibroblasts (Fig. Northern and Western blot analysis is shown of rat tissues (A and B) and 3T3-F442A cells (C and D). Whole cell extracts from rat tissues (B) and 3T3-F442A cells (D) were immunoblotted with anti-rGrb14 antibodies, preincubated with or without the antigenic peptide as indicated. C and D, 3T3-F442A cells at various stages of differentiation. Plasmid Constructions--The intracellular domains of the rat insulin receptor and of the human insulin receptor ATP binding site mutant (IR K1018A) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and inserted in frame at the BamHI site of the pLex9 plasmid (pLex-IR and pLex-IR K1018). RESULTS Two-hybrid Screen of a Rat Liver cDNA Library with the Insulin Receptor -Subunit as Bait--Seven million independent yeast colonies were tested; 104 clones contained plasmids encoding proteins that exhibited a specific interaction with the insulin receptor -subunit and not with the kinase-inactive insulin receptor mutated in the ATP binding site (IR K1018A) or with unrelated proteins like lamin. The Molecular Association of rGrb14 to the Insulin Receptor Involves the Tyrosine Kinase Regulatory Loop of the Receptor--In the two-hybrid system, a kinase-inactive insulin receptor mutant (K1018A, mutated in the ATP binding site) was unable to interact with either rGrb14 or Shc, an insulin receptor substrate taken as control (Fig. Mutation of Tyr1150 or Tyr1151 induced a 95% decrease in binding to rGrb14, whereas the IR Y1146F mutant showed a less marked impairment in its interaction with rGrb14 (50% FIG. In contrast, the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor mutant Y1146F/Y1150F might be altered, since this mutant did not bind to Shc.

15284236	In a mutant form of the Kit receptor, carrying a substitution of valine for aspartic acid in the corresponding codon (D816V) in the activation loop, PI3K is also constitutively bound and contributes to cellular transformation (36). In this case, the mutations D1228N or D1228H decrease the threshold of activation, since they overcome the requirement for the phosphorylation of one of the two tyrosines in the activation loop essential for wild-type receptor activation (13). In this case, the mutations D1228N or D1228H decrease the threshold of activation, since they overcome the requirement for the phosphorylation of one of the two tyrosines in the activation loop essential for wild-type receptor activation (13). D1228N) has been described to be transforming by preferential activation of the Ras pathway (30). specificity of affinity-purified antibodies was analyzed by Western blotting using COS cells transiently expressing human wild-type PDGFR as well as mutant receptors lacking the tyrosine corresponding to mouse Tyr856 (Y857F) or devoid of kinase activity (K634A) as controls. 6A, the antibody recognized phosphorylated wild-type PDGFR but did not react with Y857F or K634A mutant receptors, demonstrating that the antibody specifically recognized PDGFR phosphorylated on Tyr857. K634A, kinase-dead human PDGFR ; wild-type, human wild-type PDGFR ; Y857F, human PDGFR carrying phenylalanine in amino acid position 857 instead of tyrosine. Here we show that a mutation in the corresponding codon in the activation loop of the murine PDGFR , namely an exchange of asparagine for aspartic acid at amino acid position 849 (D849N), confers transforming characteristics to embryonic fibroblasts from mutant mice, generated by a knock-in strategy. By comparing the enzymatic properties of the wild-type versus the mutant receptor protein, we demonstrate that the D849N mutation lowers the threshold for kinase activation, causes a dramatic alteration in the pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation kinetics following ligand stimulation, and induces a ligand-independent phosphorylation of several tyrosine residues. As a result, the D849N mutant PDGFR up-regulates antiapoptotic pathways, intetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; STS, staurosporine. The D849N Mutant PDGFR Displays an Increased Phosphorylation and Is More Sensitive to Lower Ligand Concentrations--Based on the significantly increased transforming potential of the D849N mutation in the focus formation assay, the lack of an overt phenotype even in homozygous mutant mice came as a surprise. We therefore decided to compare the characteristics of the wild-type and the D849N mutant PDGFR from MEFs, a cell type that normally expresses the PDGFR . We first examined the ligand-dependent phosphorylation kinetics of wild-type receptor and D849N mutant PDGFR in a physiological context. The D849N mutant receptor, however, displayed not only an increased basal tyrosine phosphorylation in the absence of ligand stimulation but also an increased and prolonged ligand-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation compared with wild-type cells. Since we did not detect any significant difference in receptor amounts, we excluded the possibility that the increased phosphorylation of the D849N mutant was due to decreased receptor degradation. In addition, we found that the D849N mutant receptor was more sensitive to lower ligand concentrations compared with the wild-type receptor (Fig. These results indicated that the D849N point mutation in the PDGFR activation loop gave rise to basal constitutive receptor activation in absence of ligand, a higher sensitivity toward lower ligand concentrations and to a more robust ligand-dependent receptor phosphorylation. The D849N Mutation Increases the Threshold of Kinase Activation of the Receptor--We next analyzed the effects of this mutation on the autoactivation and catalytic properties of the PDGFR . 4A, the unstimulated receptor harboring the D849N mutation was autophosphorylated at a high rate and reached full activation after 20 min of reaction at 20 C, whereas the wild-type PDGFR was phosphorylated more slowly (Fig. 5A shows that the extent of myelin basic protein phosphorylation was higher by the unstimulated D849N mutant receptor compared with the wild-type receptor. D849N mutation in the PDGFR activation loop confers increased transforming ability upon PDGF-BB stimulation. The wild-type exon 17, containing aspartic acid 849 (the mouse PDGFR is one amino acid residue shorter; thus, Asp849 corresponds to Asp850 in the human receptor) was replaced with a mutated version with the aspartic acid replaced by an asparagine residue (D849N) (Fig. The asterisk indicates the position of the D849N point mutation. Introduction of the D849N mutation into the activation loop upregulates the PDGFR phosphorylation. was no difference between the wild-type and D849N mutant receptors in the phosphorylation rate (Fig. Tyr856 in the Activation Loop of the D849N Mutant PDGFR Is Phosphorylated in the Absence of Ligand--Activation loop trans-phosphorylation is a general mechanism of catalytic enhancement in tyrosine kinase receptors. Introduction of a mutation homologous to D849N in the activation loop of the Met receptor has been found to decrease the threshold of kinase activation, perhaps by promoting the active conformation of the activation loop (13). To study the effects of the D849N mutation on the phosphorylation of Tyr856, we developed antibodies specific for the phosphorylated form of the activation loop of the PDGFR . Introduction of the D849N mutation into the activation loop increases PDGFR autokinase activity in the absence of ligand. Wild-type and D849N mutant PDGFR immunoprecipitated from unstimulated or ligand-stimulated MEFs were analyzed by Western blotting using the specific antibody against the phosphorylated Tyr856 (Fig. The activation loop tyrosine of the D849N mutant receptor was found to be substantially phosphorylated even in absence of ligand, whereas the wild-type receptor was phosphorylated only following ligand stimulation. Phosphospecific Antibodies Revealed Deregulated Phosphorylation of Several Individual Autophosphorylation Sites in the D849N Mutant PDGFR --After we had detected significant differences not only in the total tyrosine phosphorylation, but also in the activation loop tyrosine phosphorylation, we were interested to investigate whether the D849N mutation also influences other individual tyrosine phosphorylation sites, using different site-specific, phosphotyrosine antibodies. MEFs were subjected to prolonged starvation (48 h) in order to decrease the ligand-independent phosphorylation detected in the D849N mutant PDGFR and treated for different time periods with PDGF-BB. The phosphorylation kinetics of Tyr578, Tyr1008, Tyr750, and Tyr1020 were comparable in both wild-type and D849N mutant receptor with the phosphorylation maximum at 5 min of stimulation, followed by a gradual decrease (Fig. However, despite a 48-h starvation, the D849N mutant PDGFR , but not the wild-type receptor, still displayed a basal, ligand-independent phosphorylation at all tyrosine residues tested, except for Tyr1008 and Tyr762 (Fig. In addition, the phosphorylation kinetics of Tyr770 and of Tyr762 were markedly changed in the D849N mutant PDGFR (Fig. 8, are consistent with our observations using phosphopeptide mapping (data not shown), indicating that the D849N mutation led to deregulated phosphorylation kinetics of certain tyrosine residues representing crucial binding sites for downstream molecular components of the PDGFR signaling. Up-regulation of the Ras Pathway Downstream of the D849N Mutant PDGFR --PDGF is known to be a powerful mitogen for mesenchymal cells. The activating mutation D849N increases the catalytic activity of the PDGFR toward an exogenous substrate. These data were consistent with our previous finding of a delayed phosphorylation of the Tyr770 in ligand-induced D849N mutant PDGFR (Fig. 9C shows that MEFs ex- pressing D849N mutant PDGFR displayed an increased mitogenic response, compared with wild-type MEFs. D849N Mutant PDGFR Constitutively Binds Phosphatidylinositol 3 -Kinase--Recent findings indicated that the PDGFR activates multiple signaling pathways that are involved in cellular transformation and that PI3K might be a key component by protecting cells from apoptosis (25). D849N Mutant PDGFR Constitutively Activates Protein Kinase B/Akt--In order to characterize the extent of PI3K signaling by the mutant PDGFR , we tested the phosphorylation status of protein kinase B/Akt, an important and well characterized mediator downstream of PI3K. In D849N mutant PDGFR MEFs, Akt was found to be constitutively phosphorylated, and the amount of phosphorylation could only be slightly increased by ligand 42522 Activating Mutations in PDGFR (Fig. As expected, D849N MEFs were much less sensitive to staurosporine, and only very little apoptosis could be triggered by serum starvation within 24 h (Fig. Only longer exposure to serum-free medium was able to activate an apoptotic program, but the kinetic was markedly slower in D849N than in wild-type MEFs (data not shown). Interestingly, in the presence of serum, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 could not induce apoptosis per se, but it enhanced the effect of staurosporine (STS), in this way abolishing the differences recorded between D849N and wild-type MEFs (Fig. The D849N Mutant PDGFR Mediates Cellular Motility in the Absence of Ligand--PI3K plays a pivotal role in mediating actin reorganization and motility responses (26). In order to investigate whether the constitutive activation of PI3K by the D849N mutant PDGFR causes an increased motility of the cells, we performed an in vitro "wound healing" assay. On the contrary, under these conditions, D849N mutant fibroblasts showed a strong tendency to migrate into the wounded area (Fig. B, lysates from MEFs expressing wild-type and D849N mutant PDGFR , stimulated with PDGF-BB for increasing time periods, were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-PDGFR antibodies. These results provide further evidence that PI3K is constitutively bound to and activated by the D849N mutant PDGFR even in the absence of ligand. Apoptosis Protection Mediated by D849N Mutant PDGFR -- As mentioned above, PI3K activity has a pivotal role in the control of cell survival, mainly through activation of the downstream serine/threonine kinase Akt (28). We reasoned that if D849N mutant PDGFR MEFs contain a constitutively activated PI3K and Akt, then these cells should be more resistant to apoptosis induction with respect to their wild-type counterparts. We found that mice homozygous for the D849N mutation are fertile and do not display any neoplastic phenotype for up to 12 months of age, whereas NIH3T3 fibroblasts expressing the D849N mutant PDGFR have transformed properties in vitro provided that stimulating ligand is present. In order to find possible explanations of why the D849N mutant PDGFR displays transforming ability in vitro but not in vivo, we have compared the wild-type and the mutant PDGFR s with respect to biochemical and signaling properties as well as cellular responses. In vitro experiments showed that the introduction of the D849N mutation in the PDGFR does not cause full constitutive activation of the kinase per se but lowers the threshold for activation Activating Mutations in PDGFR 42523 FIG. Deregulated phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in the D849N mutant PDGFR . Summary of the tyrosine phosphorylation kinetics for individual autophosphorylation sites in wild-type and D849N mutant PDGFR . Overview of the phosphorylation differences between wild-type and D849N mutant PDGFR s as established by the use of phosphorylation site-specific antibodies. The D849N mutant PDGFR displays deregulated mitogenic signaling. A, GTPase-activating protein for Ras (RasGAP) co-precipitated differently with activated D849N mutant PDGFR . MEFs expressing wild-type or D849N mutant PDGFR were serum-starved for 48 h and stimulated with PDGF-BB for increasing time periods. B, constitutive and prolonged phosphorylation of ERK1/2 MAP kinase in cells expressing D849N mutant PDGFR . MEFs expressing wild-type or D849N mutant PDGFR were stimulated with PDGF-BB for increasing time periods. C, increased mitogenic response to PDGF-BB of MEFs expressing D849N mutant PDGFR . MEFs expressing wild-type or D849N mutant PDGFR were serum-starved for 48 h and then incubated with [3H]thymidine in the presence of the indicated amounts of PDGF-BB for 24 h at 37 C. Intriguingly, the ERK/mitogenactivated protein kinase downstream of the D849N mutant PDGFR showed a higher and prolonged phosphorylation, and MEFs with mutant receptors showed increased proliferation upon ligand stimulation (Fig. As mentioned earlier, the PI3K binding site in the D849N mutant Activating Mutations in PDGFR 42525 FIG. The PI3K signaling pathway is constitutively activated downstream of D849N mutant PDGFR . A, constitutive binding of the p85 subunit of PI3K to the D849N mutant PDGFR . Lysates from MEFs expressing wild-type or D849N mutant PDGFR , stimulated with PDGF-BB for increasing time periods, were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-PDGFR or anti-p85 antibodies. B, constitutive phosphorylation of Akt in D849N mutant MEFs. Lysates from MEFs expressing wild-type and D849N mutant PDGFR , stimulated with PDGF-BB for different time periods, were either separated directly or first subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Akt followed by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-Akt, anti-Akt, and anti-actin antibodies. C, increased Akt-dependent resistance to apoptosis of MEFs expressing D849N mutant PDGFR . In summary, the D849N mutant PDGFR does not represent a fully constitutive active kinase but rather a deregulated enzyme with a lower threshold for activation. Increased ligand-independent migration of D849N mutant MEFs. Wild-type or D849N mutant MEFs were plated on collagen-coated coverslips and serum-starved for 24 h. Actin reorganization in D849N mutant MEFs in the absence of ligand stimulation. Wild-type or D849N mutant MEFs were plated on collagen-coated coverslips and either serum-starved, left untreated, or treated with PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) or 10% FCS for the indicated time periods. However, the D849N mutant PDGFR is able to display its oncogenic potential only upon stimulation with PDGF-BB, as we have shown in the focus formation assay (Fig. In order to test this exciting possibility, we are currently crossing a PDGF-B-transgene into the D849N mutant mice. In conclusion, we provide evidence that a D849N mutation in the PDGFR affects the regulatory mechanism, ensuring a tight regulation of the kinase, and gives rise to a mutant receptor with a lower threshold for activation. To investigate the effect of this type of mutation in the human PDGFR, we generated an expression vector for human PDGFR harboring an aspartic acid to asparagine mutation at amino acid position 850 (D850N; corresponding to position 849 in the mouse receptor) in the activation loop of the kinase domain. Overexpression of the D850N mutant human PDGFR in COS cells resulted in significantly increased ligand-independent autophosphorylation (data not shown), as has been described for other tyrosine kinase receptors carrying similar mutations (22). In the absence of ligand, the number of foci generated from D850N mutant cells was comparable with that from wildtype cells, whereas the coexpression of ligand significantly increased the number of foci from D850N mutant PDGFR cells. specificity of affinity-purified antibodies was analyzed by Western blotting using COS cells transiently expressing human wild-type PDGFR as well as mutant receptors lacking the tyrosine corresponding to mouse Tyr856 (Y857F) or devoid of kinase activity (K634A) as controls. 6A, the antibody recognized phosphorylated wild-type PDGFR but did not react with Y857F or K634A mutant receptors, demonstrating that the antibody specifically recognized PDGFR phosphorylated on Tyr857. K634A, kinase-dead human PDGFR ; wild-type, human wild-type PDGFR ; Y857F, human PDGFR carrying phenylalanine in amino acid position 857 instead of tyrosine. 
9545332	No other changes significantly affected either IRS or STAT6 (including P488G, L489A, L489R, I491A, I491R, P495A, R498A, S499A, F500A, and S501A; this report and data not shown). It has recently become clear that residues upstream of phosphotyrosines participate in the bind- 9900 I4R Motif Regulates IRS2 and STAT6 Activation in either of the hydrophobic residues shown to contact the PTB domain of IRS1, Leu498 or Ile491, demonstrated significant tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2 in response to huIL-4, although the L498A-expressing cells showed a slightly diminished level ( 60% of signal elicited of endogenous muIL-4). However, mutagenesis of Pro488 to Ala (P488A) greatly diminished the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2 and abolished tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT6, induction of DNA binding activity, and CD23 induction in response to huIL-4. Interestingly, mutagenesis of Pro488 to Ala greatly diminished the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2 and STAT6 and abolished induction of CD23 and DNA binding activity in response to huIL-4. The observation that the Pro488 to Ala change was detrimental to function and that the Pro to Gly was not suggests that Pro488 regulates the availability of the I4R motif to PTB domain-containing proteins. For example, the oligonucleotide used for the L489A mutation was designed as follows: 5 -ACA GAG ACG CCC GCC GTC ATC GCA GGC-3 (L489A). Cells expressing the P488G, L489A, I491A, and F500A mutants responded to huIL-4 by inducing STAT6 DNA binding activity. Treatment of cell lines expressing WT, P488G, L489A, I491A, R498A, and F500A with huIL-4 resulted in CD23 induction to levels seen in cells treated with the muIL-4 control. Treatment of cell lines expressing WT, P488G, L489A, I491A, R498A, and F500A with huIL-4 resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT6 to levels seen in cells treated with the muIL-4 control. We observed that the induction of STAT6 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to huIL-4 was quite rapid in cells expressing WT, P488G, L489A, or R498A. No other changes significantly affected either IRS or STAT6 (including P488G, L489A, L489R, I491A, I491R, P495A, R498A, S499A, F500A, and S501A; this report and data not shown). Treatment of cell lines expressing WT, P488G, L489A, I491A, R498A, and F500A with huIL-4 resulted in CD23 induction to levels seen in cells treated with the muIL-4 control. Treatment of cell lines expressing WT, P488G, L489A, I491A, R498A, and F500A with huIL-4 resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT6 to levels seen in cells treated with the muIL-4 control. We observed that the induction of STAT6 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to huIL-4 was quite rapid in cells expressing WT, P488G, L489A, or R498A. Cells expressing receptors with mutations downstream of Tyr497, such as R498A and F500A, also responded to huIL-4 treatment with potent tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2 comparable with the levels seen in muIL-4-treated cells. No other changes significantly affected either IRS or STAT6 (including P488G, L489A, L489R, I491A, I491R, P495A, R498A, S499A, F500A, and S501A; this report and data not shown). Changing Arg498 or Ser499 to Ala had little effect on the IC50 (8.8 and 12 M, respectively). Mutation of the central Tyr497 to Phe blocks the tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and diminishes proliferation in response to IL-4. Mutation of the central Tyr497 to Phe blocked the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 and diminished proliferation in response to IL-4 in 32D cells. Interestingly, mutation of Tyr497 to Phe, known to consistently affect activation of the IRS pathway in response to IL-4 (13, 29), also affected activation of the STAT6 DNA binding activity in approximately half of expressing clones, while the others responded normally (27, 31). However, changing both Leu498 and Ile491 to Ala greatly diminished the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2 and abolished STAT6 activation. Mutagenesis of both Leu489 and Ile491 to Ala also greatly diminished the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2 and STAT6 and abolished induction of CD23 and DNA binding activity in response to huIL-4. However, they found that changing the Leu489 or Ile491 to Ala significantly altered the IC50, to 24 and 28 M, respectively. No other changes significantly affected either IRS or STAT6 (including P488G, L489A, L489R, I491A, I491R, P495A, R498A, S499A, F500A, and S501A; this report and data not shown). By contrast, a P488G mutant signaled these responses to huIL-4. Cells expressing the P488G, L489A, I491A, and F500A mutants responded to huIL-4 by inducing STAT6 DNA binding activity. Treatment of cell lines expressing WT, P488G, L489A, I491A, R498A, and F500A with huIL-4 resulted in CD23 induction to levels seen in cells treated with the muIL-4 control. Treatment of cell lines expressing WT, P488G, L489A, I491A, R498A, and F500A with huIL-4 resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT6 to levels seen in cells treated with the muIL-4 control. We observed that the induction of STAT6 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to huIL-4 was quite rapid in cells expressing WT, P488G, L489A, or R498A. Cells expressing the P488G mutant demonstrated significant tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2 in response to huIL-4, although slightly reduced compared with the response elicited by muIL-4, suggesting that Pro488 participates in IRS recruitment by regulating the availability of the downstream I4R motif residues to interact with the PTB domain. By contrast, a P488G mutant was competent to signal these responses to huIL-4. No other changes significantly affected either IRS or STAT6 (including P488G, L489A, L489R, I491A, I491R, P495A, R498A, S499A, F500A, and S501A; this report and data not shown). Cells expressing the P488G, L489A, I491A, and F500A mutants responded to huIL-4 by inducing STAT6 DNA binding activity.

Cells expressing receptors with mutations downstream of Tyr497, such as R498A and F500A, also responded to huIL-4 treatment with potent tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2 comparable with the levels seen in muIL-4-treated cells. No other changes significantly affected either IRS or STAT6 (including P488G, L489A, L489R, I491A, I491R, P495A, R498A, S499A, F500A, and S501A; this report and data not shown).

This mutation consisted of the insertion of three nucleotides (TTG) between D835 and I836, and AT to GA substitutions at the first and second nucleotides of I836, resulting in insertion of Leu and an Ile to Asp amino acid change (I836L D). This mutation consisted of the insertion of 3 nucleotides (TTG) between D835 and I836, and AT to GA substitutions at the first and second nucleotides of I836, resulting in insertion of Leu and an Ile to Asp amino acid change (I836L D).

Of interest is that D835Y and D835E mutations were found in one AML (M3) patient, whereas cloning analysis showed that these mutations occurred in different alleles. D816 mutations of c-KIT, which are equivalent to D835 of FLT3, were found in many patients with mastocytosis as well as AML.16 Although most of the D816 mutations of c-KIT were an Asp to Val substitution (D816V), the major D835 mutation of FLT3 was an Asp to Tyr substitution (D835Y).

9715276	Results Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain convert Ron in a transforming gene To explore the oncogenic potential of Ron, we inserted in its tyrosine kinase domain single amino acid substitutions (D1232V and M1254T) reproducing the oncogenic mutations found in Kit (D814V) and Ret (M918T), respectively in human mastocytosis and in MEN2B. In this report we show that Ron can acquire oncogenic potential by means of two amino acid substitutions D1232V and M1254T aecting highly conserved residues in the tyrosine kinase domain. Results Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain convert Ron in a transforming gene To explore the oncogenic potential of Ron, we inserted in its tyrosine kinase domain single amino acid substitutions (D1232V and M1254T) reproducing the oncogenic mutations found in Kit (D814V) and Ret (M918T), respectively in human mastocytosis and in MEN2B. While Ron and Tpr Ron were totally ineective on cell transformation, the D1232V and M1254T mutants were highly transforming (Table 1). The M1254T mutation induced a high number of foci (comparable to Tpr Met: 830 850/10 mg cDNA) whether it was inserted in the context of Ron or Tpr Ron.

The M1254T mutation induced this activity to a lesser extent (Figure 5a). In contrast to the results obtained with MAPK, the D1232V and M1254T mutations did not over-stimulate JNK activity above the level stimulated by wild-type Tpr Ron. Four weeks after injection of Tpr Ron D1232V and M1254T expressing cells, mice were sacriced because they appeared cachectic and showed respiratory distress. Similar results were obtained with the Ron D1232V and M1254T mutants, but with longer latencies (Table 2).

Our data suggest that the D1232V and M1254T mutations alter substrate specicity also in the Ron receptor. Mutations D1232V and M1254T were generated on Ron cDNA, by using the following oligonucleotides 5'-GCCCGCGTCATCCTGGACAG-3' and 5'-TGAAGTGGACGGCGCTGG-3', respectively.

While Ron and Tpr Ron were totally ineective on cell transformation, the D1232V and M1254T mutants were highly transforming (Table 1). Conversely, the D1232V mutation was less ecient in transformation when inserted in the full-size Ron.

These results show relief of intrasteric inhibition for Q1208S-, K1085N-, and Y1162F-IRKD, based on increased catalytic efficiencies (kcat/ Km). Surprisingly, the Ki, AMP-PNP indicated slightly stronger nucleotide binding to the Q1208S-IRKD but 5- to 7-fold tighter nucleotide binding for the K1085N- and Y1162F-IRKD mutants. This result subdivides these kinase mutants in two groups, in which intrasteric inhibition is accompanied by (a) tighter nucleotide binding (K1085N-, Y1162F-, and D1161A-IRKD) or (b) occurs with only a modest change in affinity (Q1208S-IRKD). The value for Km, peptide for the activated Q1208S-IRKD was equivalent to activated WT-IRKD, but the Km, peptide for activated K1085N-IRKD was 5-fold higher. The autophosphorylation of Q1208S- and K1085N-IRKD was equivalent to WT-IRKD ( 3 mol of phosphate per mol of 36 kDa IRKD; not shown).

Therefore, the phosphoryl transfer reaction remains limited by a viscosity-insensitive step despite the relief of intrasteric inhibition from steady-state kinetics for the K1085N-, Y1162F-, and Q1208SIRKD. In the functional patterns emerging from solution properties, these results distinguish D1161A-IRKD from the other IRKD mutants, K1085N-IRKD is grouped with Y1162F-IRKD, and Q1208S-IRKD remains intermediate between WT-IRKD and the other mutants. Three mutants with catalytic activity were analyzed: K1085N-IRKD (circles), Y1162F-IRKD (triangles), and Q1208S-IRKD (squares). A, Y1162F-IRKD (circles); B, D1132N-IRKD (triangles), R1132Q-IRKD (squares); C, K1085N-IRKD (diamonds); D, Q1208S-IRKD (hexagons). Within this cohort of mutants, iodide quenching of fluorescence in Q1208S-IRKD in the absence of ADP was most like quenching of the WT-IRKD in the absence of ADP (Fig. In addition, quenching in the presence of ADP was essentially the same for the Q1208S mutant and the WT-IRKD. These results suggest a mostly gate-closed conformation for Q1208S-IRKD, consistent with the weak affinity for adenine nucleotides described above by Ki, AMP-PNP (Table II). Given the difference in iodide quenching due to bound ADP, we were able to titrate the equilibrium binding of adenine nucleotides to Q1208S-IRKD by the method described in Ablooglu and Kohanski (15) (titrations not shown). A more subtle pattern can be discerned in which the WT-IRKD and Q1208S have similar decay lifetimes in their unliganded states, with an average value for of 7.43 0.25 ns, compared with the four gate-open mutants of 6.36 0.18 ns. The Q1208S-IRKD is more similar to the WTIRKD than to other mutant IRKDs, with the Q1208S-IRKD appearing partially gate-open by this comparison. Quenching increased 9.3-fold upon nucleotide binding to the WT-IRKD and 3.4-fold for the Q1208S-IRKD, with the difference due mostly to the increased kq for Q1208S-IRKD in the absence of bound nucleotide. Compared with WT-IRKD, in which A-loop cleavage was barely detectable, there was greater A-loop cleavage in the absence of ADP in each of the mutants, including the Q1208S mutant, although the difference was small in that case. The extent of cleavage appeared greatly enhanced when ADP was bound to the WT- and Q1208S-IRKDs, modestly increased for the K1085N- and Y1162F-IRKDs, and barely changed for the R1136Q- and D1132N-IRKDs, where cleavage was already extensive in the absence of nucleotide (Fig. The WT-IRKD and Q1208S-IRKD cleave very slowly in the absence of ADP, reaching barely 20% net cleavage by 20 min (Fig. Similar results are obtained with the Q1208S-IRKD (Fig. The A-loop conformations in the K1085N- and Y1162F-IRKD are quite similar to each other, with or without nucleotide, and both differ from conformations apparent in the WT- and Q1208S-IRKDs. A, WT-IRKD (circles) and Q1208S-IRKD (squares); B, K1085N-IRKD (triangles, downward) and Y1162F-IRKD (triangles, upward); C, R1136Q-IRKD (hexagons) and D11322N-IRKD (diamonds). However, the structural component can be retained while the kinetic component of intrasteric inhibition is released, as shown by the gate-closed conformation in the Q1208S-IRKD that has increased catalytic efficiency. Thus, although the four mutants IRKDs had similar values of Km, MgATP, the values of Ki, AMP-PNP indicated that affinity for AMP-PNP increased 5- to 7-fold for the K1085N-, Activation Loop Conformations TABLE IV Properties of unphosphorylated kinase domains IRKD H bondsa broken Intrasteric inhibitionb Kinetic Gate Affinity for substratec AMP-PNP IRS939 A-loop conformationsd ADP 46939 ADP Active WT Q1208S Y1162F K1085N D1161A Inactive D1132N R1136Q a b 1, 4, 2, 1, 6 5 6 2, 3 Yes No No No No Closed Closed Open Open Open Open Open Weak Weak Strong Strong Strong Weak Weak Weak Weak NDe Two (9:1) Two (9:1) Two (8:2) One One One One Two (5:5) Two (5:5) Two (8:2) One One One One 5, 7 3, 4, 7 Numbers refer to hydrogen bonds in Fig. Y1162F-, and D1161A-IRKD, but only a 1.5-fold increase was observed for Q1208S-IRKD. These observations suggest a gateclosed conformation of the A-loop in Q1208S-IRKD (same Ki, AMP-PNP) that is less tightly closed than in the WT-IRKD (lower Km, MgATP), and the other mutants are gate-open (lower Ki, AMP-PNP). The slope of zero indicates that peptide substrate equilibrates before the chemical transfer step in the reaction catalyzed by the K1085N-, Q1208S-, and Y1162F-IRKD mutants, as it does for the WT-IRKD; thus Km, peptide Kd, peptide. Therefore, the K1085N, Q1208S, and Y1162F mutants have weak peptide binding, similar to the WT-IRKD basal state (Table IV). This difference may explain the apparent gate-closed conformation displayed by the Q1208S mutant and the apparent gate-open conformation resulting from the K1085N mutation, as discussed below. The larger values of kq can be interpreted as indicating greater accessibility of the active site, suggesting the order D1132N D1161A Y1162F K1085N Q1208S WT for relative openness of the cleft. These results yield the final grouping of IRKDs: the WT- and Q1208S-IRKD are mostly gate-closed in the absence of nucleotide, but at saturating nucleotide there are two nearly equal populations of A-loop conformations (Table IV). Thus, although the four mutants IRKDs had similar values of Km, MgATP, the values of Ki, AMP-PNP indicated that affinity for AMP-PNP increased 5- to 7-fold for the K1085N-, Activation Loop Conformations TABLE IV Properties of unphosphorylated kinase domains IRKD H bondsa broken Intrasteric inhibitionb Kinetic Gate Affinity for substratec AMP-PNP IRS939 A-loop conformationsd ADP 46939 ADP Active WT Q1208S Y1162F K1085N D1161A Inactive D1132N R1136Q a b 1, 4, 2, 1, 6 5 6 2, 3 Yes No No No No Closed Closed Open Open Open Open Open Weak Weak Strong Strong Strong Weak Weak Weak Weak NDe Two (9:1) Two (9:1) Two (8:2) One One One One Two (5:5) Two (5:5) Two (8:2) One One One One 5, 7 3, 4, 7 Numbers refer to hydrogen bonds in Fig. Together these ranked the openness of the active site cleft as R1136Q D1132N > D1161A > Y1162F K1085N > Q1208S > wildtype.

These features were observed previously in the D1161A-IRKD mutant (Table II), suggesting that a mutation breaking any subset of hydrogen bonds for pseudosubstrate recognition relieves intrasteric inhibition. This result subdivides these kinase mutants in two groups, in which intrasteric inhibition is accompanied by (a) tighter nucleotide binding (K1085N-, Y1162F-, and D1161A-IRKD) or (b) occurs with only a modest change in affinity (Q1208S-IRKD).

The K1085N-, Y1152F-, and D1161A-IRKD mutants share an increased affinity for adenine nucleotide, but they can be subdivided further using the patterns of viscosity dependence for steady-sate kinetic parameters (Fig. In contrast, for D1161AIRKD the slope was 0.8 and thus k3 k4 , and k3 is partially rate-limiting (14). In this respect, D1161A-IRKD is different from the other mutants and the WT-IRKD. The average value of k3 is 5.8 s 1 for K1085N- and Y1162F-IRKD, but k3 is 59 s 1 for D1161A-IRKD (14). However, the increase in k3 is another order-of-magnitude greater for D1161A-IRKD than the other mutants. Furthermore, if one relied exclusively on the change in kcat from steadystate kinetics, this would not report the change in rate-limiting step that distinguishes the D1161A mutant; that change is revealed by the viscosity-dependence for kcat. Again, there is an underlying mechanistic difference for D1161A-IRKD that is revealed by the viscosity dependence studies (Fig. In contrast, the slope was 1 for D1161A-IRKD, which indicates that peptide substrate does not equilibrate with D1161A-IRKD prior to the chemical step (14), and Kd, peptide is not determined for the D1161A mutant from these experiments. The larger values of kq can be interpreted as indicating greater accessibility of the active site, suggesting the order D1132N D1161A Y1162F K1085N Q1208S WT for relative openness of the cleft. the mutation converting Asp-1132 to Gly). The mutants R1136Q and D1132N were virtually inactive. Together these ranked the openness of the active site cleft as R1136Q D1132N > D1161A > Y1162F K1085N > Q1208S > wildtype. Taken from closely related receptor tyrosine kinases, each substitution might have the least impact on the mutant's ability to catalyze phosphoryl transfer, in contrast to the R1136Q and D1132N mutations. The R1136Q- and D1132N-IRKD mutants were effectively 4 The residues in a peptide substrate are designated as follows (40): the P0 residue is the hydroxy-amino acid that accepts the phosphate group from ATP during catalysis. A slightly different result was observed for the R1136Q-IRKD mutant; iodide quenching was significantly greater than WTIRKD in the absence of ADP but did not appear to be as extensive as the two previously analyzed mutants. The average in the absence of ADP was 6.66 0.55 ns, and in the presence of 10 mM MgADP it was 5.63 0.39 ns (excluding R1136Q-IRKD, for reasons stated under "Discussion"). One pattern is immediately apparent: the lifetime decreases in WT-IRKD and in every mutant IRKD upon ADP binding, except for the R1136Q-IRKD. In contrast, the -fold increase in kq is only 1.3 0.1 for the gate-open mutants upon ADP binding (except for R1136Q-IRKD, for which the change in kq upon nucleotide binding is opposite to all the other IRKDs examined). The extent of cleavage appeared greatly enhanced when ADP was bound to the WT- and Q1208S-IRKDs, modestly increased for the K1085N- and Y1162F-IRKDs, and barely changed for the R1136Q- and D1132N-IRKDs, where cleavage was already extensive in the absence of nucleotide (Fig. Limited proteolysis of the A-loop in the R1136Q- and D1132N-IRKD mutants is very fast and affected only slightly by the presence of ADP (Fig. A, WT-IRKD (circles) and Q1208S-IRKD (squares); B, K1085N-IRKD (triangles, downward) and Y1162F-IRKD (triangles, upward); C, R1136Q-IRKD (hexagons) and D11322N-IRKD (diamonds).

This effect is shown clearly by the lower mean fluorescence lifetime of R1136Q-IRKD (Fig. The side chains of Phe-1151 to Met-1153 that block the adenine binding pocket probably do not contribute to stability of the gate-closed conformation, as suggested by high B values for the Phe-1151 ring and the undefined side chain of Met-1153. The A-loop backbone from Phe-1151 to Met-1153 block the ATP binding site, and the phenyl ring of Phe-1151 sits in the cavity that would bind the adenine ring of ATP.

Taken from closely related receptor tyrosine kinases, each substitution might have the least impact on the mutant's ability to catalyze phosphoryl transfer, in contrast to the R1136Q and D1132N mutations.

The A-loop tyrosine mutant Y1162F-IRKD showed iodide quenching of fluorescence in the absence of ADP that was similar to the WT-IRKD ADP binary complex (Fig. Three mutants with catalytic activity were analyzed: K1085N-IRKD (circles), Y1162F-IRKD (triangles), and Q1208S-IRKD (squares).

The average value of k3 is 5.8 s 1 for K1085N- and Y1162F-IRKD, but k3 is 59 s 1 for D1161A-IRKD (14).

Therefore, the K1085N, Q1208S, and Y1162F mutants have weak peptide binding, similar to the WT-IRKD basal state (Table IV).

While overexpression of PKC- WT did not affect NM1- and IGF-IR-induced focus and colony formation of NIH 3T3 cells, expression of PKC- K376R severely impaired these events. In contrast, NM1-mediated cell growth in monolayer was not affected by coexpressing PKC- K376R. PKC- WT and PKC- K376R were constitutively phosphorylated on a tyrosine residue(s) in the NM1- and IGF-IR-expressing cells and were associated with them in an IGF-I-independent manner. Competition with endogenous PKC- for NM1 and IGF-IR association by PKC- K376R is probably an important mechanism underlying the PKC- K376R-mediated inhibition of cell transformation by NM1 and IGF-IR. Coexpression of an ATP binding mutant of PKC- (PKCK376R) (25) with the sis oncogene which encodes the PDGF-B chain significantly inhibited sis/PDGF- R-mediated cell transformation of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, strongly suggesting that PKC- is a physiological substrate involved in PDGF- Rmediated cell transformation (21). 18, 1998 INHIBITION OF IGF-IR TRANSFORMATION BY PKC- K376R 5889 FIG. Expression of PKC- K376R inhibits focus formation induced by NM1 and full-length IGF-IR. (A) NM1, dS2, and F1136 of NM1 and T6 were all cloned in pMEXneo vector and cotransfected with pLTR vector containing either PKC- WT or PKC- K376R with the amounts indicated. Inhibition of NM1-induced focus formation by coexpressing PKC- K376R had been observed more than three times. Our results demonstrate that transformation of NIH 3T3 cells by NM1 is severely impaired by coexpression of PKC- K376R. The PKC- K376R mutant is also capable of blocking full-length IGF-IR-mediated focus formation in response to exogenous IGF-I. Cloning of PKC- WT and PKC- K376R into the pLTRgpt vector was reported before (25). Briefly, puri- RESULTS Expression of PKC- K376R mutant severely impairs NM1-, IGF-IR-, and T6-induced focus formation of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. In striking contrast, coexpression of PKC- K376R with NM1 reduced its focus-forming activity by 90%. Both dS2- and F1136-induced focus-forming activities were also severely inhibited by coexpression of PKC- K376R. The focus-forming activity of T6 was nearly abolished in the presence of PKCK376R, which was a result consistent with that of NM1. We then tested whether full-length IGF-IR-induced transformation of NIH 3T3 cells could be affected by expression of PKC- K376R. NIH 3T3 cells were cotransfected with fulllength IGF-IR and the PKC- WT or PKC- K376R plasmid. In contrast, expression of PKC- K376R totally abolished focus formation by spontaneous and IGF-I-stimulated IGF-IR activation. Anchorage-independent growth of NIH 3T3 cells induced by NM1 is inhibited by PKC- K376R. To test whether expression of PKC- K376R also affected NM1-mediated anchorage-independent growth, we generated stable NIH 3T3 transfectants coexpressing NM1 and PKC- K376R. 18, 1998 INHIBITION OF IGF-IR TRANSFORMATION BY PKC- K376R 5891 FIG. Anchorage-independent growth induced by NM1 is suppressed when PKC- K376R is coexpressed. In striking contrast, expression of PKC- K376R significantly reduced the number of NM1-induced colonies in soft agar. PKC- K376R expression does not affect the growth rate of NM1-expressing cells in monolayer. The growth rates of cells stably cotransfected with NM1 and PKC- WT or PKCK376R in monolayer culture were measured in the presence of two serum concentrations. Nevertheless, neither coexpression of PKC- WT nor that of PKC- K376R affected the growth rate of NM1-expressing cells at either serum concentration. IGF-IR expression and kinase activity are not affected by coexpression of the PKC- K376R mutant. The expression levels of PKC- WT and PKC- K376R were increased by fiveand threefold, respectively, over that of the endogenous PKC(Fig. The protein level for the PKC- K376R mutant was lower than that of PKC- WT in the different transfectants, 5892 LI ET AL. Monolayer cell growth mediated by NM1 is not affected by PKCK376R expression. NM1/pLTR (squares), NM1/pLTR- WT (diamonds), and NM1/pLTR- K376R (circles) transfectants were plated in six-well Coaster plates and maintained in DMEM containing either 10% (A) or 1% (B) calf serum. To determine whether overexpression of PKC- WT or PKCK376R would affect NM1 and IGF-IR tyrosine kinase activities, the extents of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and in vitro kinase activities of NM1 and IGF-IR were measured. We did not observe any significant changes in the level of NM1 protein tyrosine phosphorylation upon coexpression of either PKC- WT or PKC- K376R. Again, ligand-dependent phosphorylation of IGF-IR was not affected by coexpression of PKC- K376R. The in vitro kinase assay was performed to further examine the effect of PKC- K376R on NM1 and IGF-IR kinase activities. 5B [indicated by the asterisk]), but not from the NM1/pLTR or NM1/pLTR- K376R cotransfectant. Expression of PKC- K376R did not affect activation of the endogenous IGF-IR. These results indicate that the inhibitory effect of PKC- K376R on NM1 and IGF-IR transformation is not due to its effect on receptor activation and expression. Ligand stimulation resulted in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the overexpressed IGF-IR to a similar extent in PKC- WT and PKC- K376R cotransfectants. 18, 1998 INHIBITION OF IGF-IR TRANSFORMATION BY PKC- K376R 5893 FIG. NM1 and IGF-IR activities are not inhibited by PKC- K376R expression. Phosphorylation of the PKC- K376R mutant protein by NM1 was much higher than that of PKC- WT, even though mutant protein expression was two- to threefold lower (Fig. This is consistent with our previous finding that PKC- K376R protein was constitutively and highly phosphorylated on tyrosine, which may be due to its exclusive localization in the membrane fraction of the cell. Likewise, PKC- K376R was constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine at a level higher than that of PKC- WT in the IGF-IR/pLTR- K376R cotransfectant. PKC- WT and PKC- K376R proteins are constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated in NM1- or IGF-IR-cotransfected NIH 3T3 cells. Failure to detect the same 80-kDa protein from the NM1/pLTR- K376R cotransfectant further suggested its identity as PKC- , since PKC- K376R is not able to undergo autophosphorylation (25). 18, 1998 INHIBITION OF IGF-IR TRANSFORMATION BY PKC- K376R 5895 FIG. PKC- WT and PKC- K376R are constitutively associated with NM1 and IGF-IR in vivo. 8A, both PKC- WT and PKC- K376R proteins were detected in anti-IGF-IR immunoprecipitates from lysates of NM1-cotransfected cells. The amounts of PKC- associated with NM1 protein were proportional to the expression levels of PKC- WT and PKC- K376R in the respective cotransfectants (Fig. PKC- WT and PKCK376R coimmunoprecipitated by anti-IGF-IR migrated as doublets or triplets on SDS-PAGE gels, which may be due to existence of multiple phosphorylated forms of PKC- as reported elsewhere (25). PKC- K376R was also detected from antiIGF-IR immunoprecipitates in the IGF-IR/pLTR- K376R cotransfectant, albeit at a much lower level (data not shown). In the reciprocal experiment, we found that IGF-IR was detected in the anti-PKC- immunoprecipitates from the IGFIR/pLTR, IGF-IR/pLTR- WT, or IGF-IR/pLTR- K376R cotransfectant, with the most abundant association detected from the IGF-IR/pLTR- WT cotransfectant (Fig. These results demonstrate that PKC- WT and PKC- K376R are associated with both IGF-IR and NM1 in a ligand-independent manner in NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing these proteins. The IGFIR- and oncogenic IR-mediated transformation is inhibited by coexpression of an ATP binding mutant of PKC- (PKCK376R). To date, we have shown that c-Sis (PDGF-B)-, IGF-IR-, and IR-induced, but not v-H-Ras- and v-Raf-induced, transformation of NIH 3T3 cells can be blocked by coexpressing PKC- K376R, indicating specificity in the dominant inhibitory effect of this mutant on oncogenemediated cell transformation. PKC- K376R expression did not affect NM1 or IGF-IR tyrosine kinase activities, indicating that PKC- K376R must exert its inhibitory effect downstream of receptor activation. Inhibition of oncogenic IR-induced transformation by the PKC- K376R mutant correlates with these observations. Inhibition of NM1 and IGF-IR transformation by the PKC- K376R mutant and its association with these receptors further substantiate the specific role of endogenous PKC- in IGF-IRmediated cell transformation. The exact mechanism underlying PKC- K376R inhibition of NM1 and IGF-IR transformation is still unclear. However, the association of PKC- K376R with NM1 and IGF-IR in vivo strongly suggests that PKC- K376R might compete with endogenous PKC- for IGF-IR binding. Thus, PKC- K376R competition may block the PKC- -mediated signal transduction pathway utilized by IGF-IR by sequestering important substrates whose activation requires phosphorylation by endogenous PKC- . 18, 1998 INHIBITION OF IGF-IR TRANSFORMATION BY PKC- K376R 5897 termine whether association of PKC- with NM1 or IGF-IR in vivo is direct, and, if so, which regions of PKC- and IGF-IR are required for this association. For example, downregulation of the IGF-IR by antisense oligonucleotide blocking has been demonstrated to reduce the tumorigenicity of human glioblastoma T98G, rat glioblastoma C6, human breast carcinoma MC-F7, and mouse melanoma B16F10 cells (5). 
10574909	One mutation (P80Q) affects a residue in an SH2 domain and another (M572L) in the kinase subdomain XI. We further demonstrated that Cdc37, a protein kinase-specific chaperone, bound to M572L but not P80Q mutant and restored the expression of the M572L mutant when overexpressed. The restoration of M572L mutant by Cdc37 required the function of HSP90. P80Q and M572L mutants were created by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (Quick Change TM , Stratagene). A, Jurkat cells were transfected with the WT, M572L mutant (ML), or P80Q mutant (PQ) constructs containing Myc-epitope tags and subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies against the Myc-epitope (MBL, upper panel) or HSP90 (32) as a control (lower panel). [35S]methionine-labeled ZAP70 proteins (ML, M572L mutant) prepared by an in vitro translation system were incubated at 37 C for the indicated period with either total lysate (open symbols) or proteasome-inactivated lysate (closed symbols), which was obtained by pretreatment of the cells with 30 M lactacystin. D, biotinylated ZAP70 proteins (ML, M572L mutant; PQ, P80Q mutant) were incubated with or without total lysate at 37 C for 60 min in the presence of 2 mM ATP (ATP ) and analyzed by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot analysis with streptavidin-HRP. E, biotinylated ZAP70 proteins (ML, M572L mutant; PQ, P80Q mutant) were incubated with or without S500 fraction at 37 C for 30 min and visualized (upper panel) as in D. 6), and an A to T transition at position 1923, causing the substitution of leucine for methionine at residue 572 (M572L) in the kinase subdomain XI (23). In fact, pulse-chase experiments showed that whereas WT ZAP70 protein was stable with a half-life of 4 h, P80Q as well as M572L mutant proteins were rapidly degraded with a half-life of approximately 1 h (Fig. When incubated with total cell lysates in an in vitro degradation assay system, both M572L and P80Q mutant proteins prepared by an in vitro translation system were degraded in an ATP-dependent manner, whereas WT ZAP70 protein remained stable (Fig. A, Jurkat cells were transfected with the expression vector for the WT, P80Q (PQ), or M572L (ML) mutants. B, Jurkat cells transfected with the expression vector for WT, M572L (ML), or P80Q (PQ) mutants or for control vector alone (V) were cultured at 30 C. C, WT, M572L (ML), and P80Q (PQ) mutants were in vitro translated at 30 C in the presence of [35S]methionine (upper panel). B, Jurkat cells transfected with 3 g each of the expression vector for the M572L mutant or the P80Q mutant along with the indicated amount of pSR -HA-Cdc37 were cultured at 30 or 37 C and subjected to immunoblot analysis as in A. C, biotinylated ZAP70 proteins (WT, wild-type; ML, M572L mutant; PQ, P80Q mutant) were incubated with 0, 0.5, 2, or 10 g of GST-Cdc37 at 30 C for 30 min, and the binding was measured by pull-down assay with glutathioneSepharose. D, Jurkat cells transfected with the expression vector for ZAP70 (WT) or the M572L mutant (ML) along with pSR -HA-Cdc37 were cultured with either vehicle or 2 g/ml of geldanamycin (GA) for 24 h. P80Q and M572L Mutants Are Temperature-sensitive--Because the in vitro translation reaction was performed at 30 C, it was possible that the mutant proteins are stable at low temperatures. Both P80Q and M572L mutant proteins were readily detected in transfected cells at a temperature lower than 33 C (Fig. On the other hand, the activity of the M572L mutant was partially impaired. Although pervanadate induced the same level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the WT and M572L mutant proteins in vivo (Fig. The 35S-labeled P80Q mutant ZAP70 protein produced in vitro at 30 C bound to the phosphorylated ITAM peptide with an affinity comparable to the WT and M572L mutant in an in vitro pull-down assay (Fig. Cdc37 in Conjunction with HSP90 Restores the Expression of M572L Mutant--It has been suggested that mutant proteins, which are incompletely or improperly folded when synthesized, are degraded unless folding intermediates are compromised by their cofactor(s), namely chaperone(s) (27, 28). Expression levels of the M572L mutant at both permissive and nonpermissive temperatures were also remarkably augmented by co-transfection with Cdc37 (Fig. Although not shown, co-expression of Cdc37 did not affect the half-life of the M572L 34518 Temperature-sensitive zap70 Mutations Acknowledgments--We thank the family members of the patient for help with this study. One mutation (P80Q) affects a residue in an SH2 domain and another (M572L) in the kinase subdomain XI. We further demonstrated that Cdc37, a protein kinase-specific chaperone, bound to M572L but not P80Q mutant and restored the expression of the M572L mutant when overexpressed.

E, biotinylated ZAP70 proteins (ML, M572L mutant; PQ, P80Q mutant) were incubated with or without S500 fraction at 37 C for 30 min and visualized (upper panel) as in D. 1B): a C to A transition at position 448, resulting in a substitution of glutamine for proline at residue 80 (P80Q) in the N-terminal SH2 domain (numbering according to Ref. In fact, pulse-chase experiments showed that whereas WT ZAP70 protein was stable with a half-life of 4 h, P80Q as well as M572L mutant proteins were rapidly degraded with a half-life of approximately 1 h (Fig. When incubated with total cell lysates in an in vitro degradation assay system, both M572L and P80Q mutant proteins prepared by an in vitro translation system were degraded in an ATP-dependent manner, whereas WT ZAP70 protein remained stable (Fig. A, Jurkat cells were transfected with the expression vector for the WT, P80Q (PQ), or M572L (ML) mutants. B, Jurkat cells transfected with the expression vector for WT, M572L (ML), or P80Q (PQ) mutants or for control vector alone (V) were cultured at 30 C. C, WT, M572L (ML), and P80Q (PQ) mutants were in vitro translated at 30 C in the presence of [35S]methionine (upper panel). D, Jurkat cells were transfected with either ZAP70 C (WT) or ZAP70 C containing P80Q mutation (PQ) along with NFAT-Luc. B, Jurkat cells transfected with 3 g each of the expression vector for the M572L mutant or the P80Q mutant along with the indicated amount of pSR -HA-Cdc37 were cultured at 30 or 37 C and subjected to immunoblot analysis as in A. C, biotinylated ZAP70 proteins (WT, wild-type; ML, M572L mutant; PQ, P80Q mutant) were incubated with 0, 0.5, 2, or 10 g of GST-Cdc37 at 30 C for 30 min, and the binding was measured by pull-down assay with glutathioneSepharose. P80Q and M572L Mutants Are Temperature-sensitive--Because the in vitro translation reaction was performed at 30 C, it was possible that the mutant proteins are stable at low temperatures. Both P80Q and M572L mutant proteins were readily detected in transfected cells at a temperature lower than 33 C (Fig. The WT and P80Q mutant ZAP70 were similarly activated by pervanadate as indicated by autophosphorylation of ZAP70 and phosphorylation of tubulin (Fig. The 35S-labeled P80Q mutant ZAP70 protein produced in vitro at 30 C bound to the phosphorylated ITAM peptide with an affinity comparable to the WT and M572L mutant in an in vitro pull-down assay (Fig. Note that the P80Q mutant synthesized in vitro bound to the phosphorylated ITAM peptide even at 37 C, the nonpermissive temperature, indicating that the protein is stable at 37 C once synthesized and properly folded. To examine whether the SH2 domains of the P80Q mutant bind to ITAMs in vivo, we constructed a dominant-negative form of ZAP70 (ZAP70 C), consisting of two SH2 domains, that sequesters endogenous ZAP70 from phosphorylated ITAMs (26). When expressed at 30 C, the ZAP70 C containing the P80Q mutation blocked the TCRinduced signaling pathway as well as the ZAP70 C consisting of the WT SH2 domains (Fig. However, such a blocking effect by the P80Q mutant was not observed at 37 C. Thus, the defect resulting from the P80Q mutation is likely due to the rapid degradation of mutant polypeptide and not to a lack of SH2 function.

By contrast, point mutations in the C chain (Tyr-31 3 Phe) and the A chain (Ile-43 3 Phe) resulted in a noticeably weaker color reaction and modestly reduced activity in the quantitative assay.

Furthermore, one B-chain mutant (Leu-14 3 Arg) and one A-chain mutant (Glu-46 3 Ala) had completely lost ability to interact with the IGF-1 receptor in this assay. Using PCR-based mutagenesis with proinsulin, we also identified a gain of function mutant (proinsulin Leu-17 3 Pro) that allowed for a strong IGF-1receptor interaction.

By contrast, point mutations in the C chain (Tyr-31 3 Phe) and the A chain (Ile-43 3 Phe) resulted in a noticeably weaker color reaction and modestly reduced activity in the quantitative assay. About 12% of the mutants, including Tyr-24 3 Lys, showed very high background with these controls and thus could not be accurately evaluated in the yeast system (data not shown). First, one of the mutants (Cys-18 3 Gly) that still interacts in the two-hybrid system involves a cysteine residue that participates in disulfide bond formation with Cys-61 (29).

The expression vectors encoding Neu (pJ4 NeuN and pSV2NeuN), NeuT (pJ4 NeuT and pSV2NeuT), the ECD mutants of Neu (8142, 8340, 8342, and 8567) (61), the carboxy-terminal deletion of NeuT ( CT), and the CT mu- tants pLSV P1, P1F, P2,3, P4, P5, and Y1253F (9) were previously described. The P1F mutant, which has a substitution of the terminal tyrosine for phenylalanine, was poorly transforming in Rat-1 cells and in athymic mice and was defective in activation of the cyclin D1 promoter. The induction of cyclin D1 by P1F was 37% of the value for P1 (Fig. The expression vectors encoding Neu (pJ4 NeuN and pSV2NeuN), NeuT (pJ4 NeuT and pSV2NeuT), the ECD mutants of Neu (8142, 8340, 8342, and 8567) (61), the carboxy-terminal deletion of NeuT ( CT), and the CT mu- tants pLSV P1, P1F, P2,3, P4, P5, and Y1253F (9) were previously described. tyrosine 1253 to phenylalanine (Y1253F) in the context of NeuT reduced transforming ability to 17% (9). 2 Cyclin D1 Is Required for Transformation by Activated Neu and Is Induced through an E2F-Dependent Signaling Pathway RICHARD J. NeuT induction of the cyclin D1 promoter required the E2F and Sp1 DNA binding sites and was inhibited by dominant negative E2F-1 or DP-1. Neu-induced transformation was inhibited by a cyclin D1 antisense or dominant negative E2F-1 construct in Rat-1 cells. These results demonstrate that E2F-1 mediates a Neu-signaling cascade to cyclin D1 and identify cyclin D1 as a critical downstream target of neu-induced transformation. The E2F site of the cyclin D1 promoter was mutated from TTTGGCGCC to TTTcttGaC (mutated bases are in lowercase) in the context of the 163 bp fragment, using PCR to form 163E2FmtCD1LUC. The vectors pCMV-E2F-1, pCMV-DC-E2F-1 E132, pCMV-E2F-1-Y411C, pCMV-HADP-1, and pCMV-HA-DP-1 103-126 were previously described (70, 80). The Sp1, Sp3, and E2F-1 activation domains were linked to the GAL4 DNA binding domain to form GAL4-Sp1(83-621) (63), GAL4-Sp3(1-382), GAL4E2F-1(368437), and GAL4E2F-1( 413-417), which is defective in regulation by pRB. The oligonucleotide sequences used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were as follows: for the adenovirus E2F site, 5 GCC GTC CAG TTT CGC GCC CTT TCT CAA ATT TAA GCA GCT CGA; for the cyclin D1 E2F site, 5 TCC CGG CGT TTG GCG CCC GCG CCC; for the cyclin D1 Sp1 site ( 130 to 99), 5 TCC CCC TGC GCC CGC CCC CGC CCC CCT CCC GC; and for the consensus Sp1 site, 5 ATT CGA TCG GGG CGG GGC GAG C. For the mutant cyclin D1 E2F oligonucleotide, the wild-type TTT GGC GCC CG sequence was changed to cga Gct GCC CG. The sequence of the primer used to mutate the cyclin D1 E2F site (TTTGGC GCC) was 5 GGT ACC TCG CTG CTC CCG GCG TTT ctt gaC CGC G. EMSAs using the E2F sequences were performed essentially as previously described (66). Sf9 cells were infected with equal amounts (PFU) of baculoviruses encoding E2F-1, E2F-4, DP-1, or DP-2. Antisera to E2F and DP proteins (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, Calif.) were used to confirm the components of each protein-DNA complex (not shown). To determine relative binding activities of the individual complexes, radioactivity in each complex was calculated with a phosphorimager (Packard Instant Imager), and the counts in the cyclin D1 complexes were normalized to the value for the corresponding adenovirus E2F complexes. Isolated chromatin was sonicated to an average length of 0.5 to 1 kb and treated with 1 g of rabbit anti-E2F-1 antibody (C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or control rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) for 16 h at 4C. (A) Schematic representation of the cyclin D1 promoter, with the sequences homologous to E2F and Sp1 binding sites indicated. (C) The heterologous constructions, encoding the E2F or Sp1 site of the cyclin D1 promoter linked to the minimal TK promoter, were transfected with pSV2NeuT into MCF7 cells. Sp1 and E2F binding sites are required for full induction of the cyclin D1 promoter by NeuT. Within the proximal promoter, we had recently identified functional sequences resembling an E2F binding site and an Sp1 binding site (70) (Fig. Mutation of the E2F site in the context of the 163 bp promoter fragment ( 163E2Fmt) reduced NeuT induction from 25- to 3-fold (Fig. The cyclin D1 E2F and Sp1 sequences were linked to the minimal thymidine kinase (TK) promoter to form heterologous reporters and were examined for NeuT responsiveness. The cyclin D1 Sp1 site was induced 10.5-fold by NeuT, and the cyclin D1 E2F site reporter was induced 15.6-fold (Fig. E2F-1 and Sp1/Sp3 bind the cyclin D1 promoter in MCF7 cells. Previous studies had demonstrated that E2F-1, E2F-4, DP-1, and pRB family members bind the cyclin D1 E2F site (70). To compare the relative binding affinities of E2F-1 and E2F-4 to the cyclin D1 and adenovirus E2F sequences, EMSAs were performed with in vitro-prepared E2F and DP proteins (Fig. E2F-1 bound the cyclin D1 E2F sequence when incubated with either of its dimerization partners, DP-1 (Fig. E2F-4 bound the cyclin D1 E2F site, albeit with less affinity than E2F-1 (Fig. Mutation of the cyclin D1 E2F sequence abolished binding of either E2F-1 or E2F-4 (Fig. The cyclin D1 E2F sequence had lower affinity for each E2F-DP complex compared with the adenoviral E2F sequence (Fig. 5B, compare lanes 5 to 8 with lanes 1 to 4, respectively; percentages of binding to the cyclin D1 E2F site compared to the adenoviral E2F site are given under lanes 5 to 8). Because native chromatin structure may alter the ability of transcription factors to bind a specific DNA sequence, changes in E2F occupancy may be detected only with the use of higherresolution analysis, such as in vivo footprinting (2). CHIP assays were performed to analyze E2F-1 binding to the cyclin D1 promoter in the context of native chromatin. Analyses were performed of E2F-1 binding to the cyclin D1 promoter in the stable cell line (Fig. PCR amplification of chromatin cross-linked extracts immunoprecipitated with an E2F-1 specific antibody identified the product corresponding to the cyclin D1 E2F site and its surrounding genomic sequence (Fig. CHIP analysis of wild-type MCF7 cells also identified E2F-1 binding to the endogenous cyclin D1 gene (Fig. These studies demonstrate that E2F-1 binds to the cyclin D1 promoter in the context of its native chromatin structure in MCF7 cells. Together, these results indicate that the DNA sequences within the cyclin D1 promoter that are sufficient for induction by NeuT in MCF7 cells are capable of binding Sp1, Sp3, and E2F-1. Sp1, Sp3, and E2F-1 transactivation function is induced by NeuT. To determine whether E2F-1 is critical for NeuT induc- 678 LEE ET AL. Sp1/Sp3 and E2F-1 proteins bind the neuT-responsive elements of the cyclin D1 promoter. The 32P-labeled adenovirus E2F site (lanes 1 to 4) and wild-type (lanes 5 to 8) or mutant (lanes 9 to 10) cyclin D1 E2F sites were incubated with E2F and DP proteins as indicated above the lanes. Relative binding compared to the adenovirus E2F site for each E2F-DP complex is indicated below each lane. PCR was performed with cyclin D1-specific primers on water (lane 2), control plasmid (lane 3), or immunoprecipitation buffer (lane 4) or after immunoprecipitation of formaldehyde cross-linked cell extracts with either IgG control (lanes 5 and 7) or E2F-1-specific antibody (lanes 6 and 8). tion of cyclin D1 promoter activity, experiments were conducted with DNA-binding-defective mutant E2F-1 E132 or activation-defective mutant E2F-1 Y411C. E2F-1 E132 functions as a dominant inhibitor of E2F activity by dimerizing with DP proteins and thereby blocking the DNA binding of the active E2F-DP complex. E2F-1 Y411C binds competitively to E2F binding sites and thereby blocks activation by wild-type E2F-1. Overexpression of E2F-1 E132 or E2F-1 Y411C reduced the NeuT induction of cyclin D1 by 33 or 30%, respectively (Fig. In contrast, overexpression of the wild-type E2F-1 further induced cyclin D1 promoter activity 2.6-fold (Fig. These results are consistent with a requirement for E2F-1 for optimal induction of cyclin D1 by NeuT. As these results contrast with the inhibitory effect of E2F-1 on basal cyclin D1 promoter activity in trophoblastic cells and fibroblasts (70), we assessed whether E2F-1 has a cell-typespecific effect on basal activity of the 1745CD1LUC reporter in MCF7 cells. E2F-1 induced the cyclin D1 promoter in MCF7 cells 3.8-fold (Fig. Overexpression of either the E2F-1 E132 mutant or the DP-1 dominant negative inhibited the cyclin D1 promoter by 36 or 34%, respectively (Fig. 6B), whereas the E2F-1 Y411C mutant had no effect (not shown). To identify the DNA sequences required for induction of the cyclin D1 promoter by E2F-1, cotransfection experiments were conducted with the cyclin D1 promoter deletion constructs (Fig. The induction by E2F-1 was maintained in the 163 bp fragment but was lost upon point mutation of the E2F site ( 163 E2FmutLUC), suggesting that the E2F site is the region required for optimal induction by E2F-1 overexpression (Fig. E2F-1 is therefore a positive regulator of cyclin D1 in MCF7 cells. The results presented above indicated that NeuT induced the cyclin D1 promoter through an E2F binding site that bound E2F-1 and was required for E2F-1 induction in MCF7 cells and through an Sp1 binding site that bound Sp1 and Sp3. To understand how NeuT may induce cyclin D1 through the E2F-1 and Sp1/Sp3 binding sequences, we tested whether NeuT regulates E2F-1, Sp1, and Sp3 transactivation function. The NeuT-regulated activity of Sp1 and E2F-1 was examined in conjunction with a heterologous reporter construction, (UAS)5E1BTATALUC, consisting of multimeric GAL4 DNA binding sites linked to a luciferase reporter gene (Fig. E2F-1, Sp1, and Sp3 conveyed basal enhancer function in MCF7 cells, and overexpression of NeuT enhanced E2F-1 activity 6.3-fold. E2F-1 transactivation function is regulated by the relative abundance of pRB, and selected deletions within the carboxy-terminal pRB binding domain abolish transcriptional regulation by pRB (22). In contrast with GAL4E2F-1, the carboxy-terminal E2F-1 mutant GAL4E2F-1( 413-417) was not induced by NeuT. Induction of E2F-1, Sp1, and Sp3 transactivation by NeuT. The effects of wild-type E2F-1, the E132 mutant E2F-1, the Y411C mutant E2F-1, and the DP-1 dominant negative mutant on NeuT-induced (A) or basal (B) cyclin D1 promoter activity were assessed in MCF7 cells and compared with effects of the respective empty vectors. (C) The E2F-1 expression vector was transfected with cyclin D1 5 promoter constructs into MCF7 cells. The reporter (UAS)5E1BTATALUC (2.4 g) was transfected with expression vectors for GAL4E2F-1, GAL4E2F-1( 413-417) (the pRBbinding-defective E2F-1 mutant), GAL4-Sp1, GAL4-Sp3, PAG236, and either pSV2NeuT (600 ng) or empty expression vector cassette in MCF7 cells. The cyclin D1 antisense (pBPSTR-1CD1AS) (A) and the dominant negative mutants for N17Ras, N17Rac, N19Rho, MEKC, and E2F-1 (E2F-1 E132) (2.5 or 5 g) (B) were assessed in comparison to the empty expression vector cassette. Our studies above had found that a dominant negative mutant of E2F-1 was capable of inhibiting NeuT-induced cyclin D1 promoter activity, implicating E2F-1 as a downstream target of NeuT signaling. To examine the role of E2F-1 in NeuTinduced transformation, we coexpressed the E2F-1 E132 mutant with NeuT in Rat-1 cells. Compared with the empty expression vector, which had no effect on transformation, the E2F-1 E132 plasmid inhibited NeuT-induced transformation by 40% (Fig. Together, these results are consistent with a model in which NeuT-induced transformation involves Ras, Rac, Rho, MEK1, E2F-1, and cyclin D1 for full transformation. These studies identify for the first time specific transcriptional targets activated by NeuT within the cyclin D1 promoter, indicating an important role for E2F-1 in both NeuT-induced transformation and cyclin D1 promoter activation. E2F-1 can function as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor likely dependent on cellular context, although the molecular mechanisms governing these events is poorly understood (73). NeuT induced the cyclin D1 E2F site when linked to an heterologous promoter in MCF7 cells, whereas in previous studies performed in trophoblastic cells and mouse embryo fibroblasts (70), E2F-1 inhibited cyclin D1 abundance and promoter activity. Thus, E2F-1 conveys cell-type-specific effects on the cyclin D1 promoter likely related to additional E2F/DP family members or cofactors present within a given cell type. Recent studies have indicated that in vitro, distinct E2F sites have preferential affinities for members of the E2F family (66). The cyclin D1 E2F sequence resembles most closely the consensus sequence that was found to preferentially bind pRBE2F-1 DP-1 complexes (66). Indeed, E2F-1 bound the cyclin D1 sequence with greater affinity than E2F-4 in these studies, and pRB is a component of complexes that can bind the cyclin D1 E2F site (reference 70 and data not shown). In MCF7 cells, CHIP assays demonstrated binding of E2F-1 specifically to the cyclin D1 promoter in the context of native chromatin. Further characterization of the additional proteins binding to the cyclin D1 promoter E2F site may provide greater insight into the mechanisms of neu-mediated transformation and is the focus of ongoing studies. The E2F-1 transactivation domain linked to the GAL4 DNA binding domain was sufficient for induction by NeuT. Cyclin D1 overexpression leads to the induction of pRB phosphorylation and the release of free E2F-1 (74), which is capable of inducing promoter activity through either Sp1 or E2F sites (30). Consistent with a role for E2F-1 in NeuT induction of cyclin D1, the DNA-binding-defective and activation-defective mutants of E2F-1 and the dominant negative mutant of DP-1 inhibited NeuT induction of cyclin D1, and E2F-1 E132 inhibited NeuT-induced transformation. Because cyclin D1 overexpression can induce promoter activity through E2F sequences (82) and overexpression of pRB inhibits E2F-1 transactivation function (22), NeuT may sustain cyclin D1-mediated autoinduction through the E2F and Sp1 sites. Sp1 binds several intermediary proteins, some of which have been implicated in mitogenic signaling, including the E2F-1 and E2F-3 proteins (30). E2F-1-mediated transactivation is inhibited by complex formation with the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product. Interaction of Sp1 with growth- and cell cycle-regulated transcription factor E2F. Subunit composition determines E2F DNA-binding site specificity. Inhibition of cyclin D-kinase activity is associated with E2F-mediated inhibition of cyclin D1 promoter activity through E2F and Sp1. E2F and cell proliferation: a world turned upside down. Multiple members of the E2F transcription factor family are the products of oncogenes. A substitution point mutation at residue 664 (Val3Glu) in the transmembrane domain of rat Neu (referred to as NeuT) encodes an activated transforming tyrosine kinase (7). The vectors pCMV-E2F-1, pCMV-DC-E2F-1 E132, pCMV-E2F-1-Y411C, pCMV-HADP-1, and pCMV-HA-DP-1 103-126 were previously described (70, 80). tion of cyclin D1 promoter activity, experiments were conducted with DNA-binding-defective mutant E2F-1 E132 or activation-defective mutant E2F-1 Y411C. E2F-1 Y411C binds competitively to E2F binding sites and thereby blocks activation by wild-type E2F-1. Overexpression of E2F-1 E132 or E2F-1 Y411C reduced the NeuT induction of cyclin D1 by 33 or 30%, respectively (Fig. 6B), whereas the E2F-1 Y411C mutant had no effect (not shown). The effects of wild-type E2F-1, the E132 mutant E2F-1, the Y411C mutant E2F-1, and the DP-1 dominant negative mutant on NeuT-induced (A) or basal (B) cyclin D1 promoter activity were assessed in MCF7 cells and compared with effects of the respective empty vectors. A substitution point mutation at residue 664 (Val 3 Glu) in the transmembrane domain of rat Neu (referred to as NeuT) encodes an activated transforming tyrosine kinase (7).

Ternary complex model In the context of the standard model of EGFEGFr interaction, the above results imply that a novel extracellular conformation of the EGFr was produced by the point mutation Y992E. An alternative model for the EGFEGFr interaction has therefore been examined ; this model invokes only the two wild-type extracellular conformations of the EGFr and yet is capable of predicting the observed shift of the low-affinity dissociation constant for the Y992E receptor as well as the non-linear Scatchard plots found for EGFEGFr binding. It is this equilibrium mixing step, in combination with the trap for the high-affinity conformation of the EGFr, that makes this ternary complex model capable of describing the behaviour of wild-type and mutant EGFr, including Y992E.

DISCUSSION Ligand binding to the full-length point mutant EGFr described here indicates that, of the point mutants made, only the Y992E mutation affects EGF binding. However, the decrease in the macroscopic low-affinity dissociation constant of the Y992E mutant in comparison with the wild-type EGFr seems to be a real effect. The inclusion of a second cyclic reaction pathway in which the molecular high-affinity and low-affinity conformations of the # 2000 Biochemical Society EGFr can mix with each other (Scheme 1B, bottom reaction cycle) is necessary in the model because binding data from the Y992E EGFr point mutant described here, along with a deletion mutant described by van der Heyden et al. This result is similar to that seen in the Y992E mutant. We thank Dr Julia Hill for assistance with one of the Y992E ligand binding experiments, Mr John O 'Donnell for assistance in clone isolation for the Y992E CHO cell line, and Dr Robert Weis for reading the manuscript. In addition, a truncation mutation was produced while generating the E991Q mutants. This mutation truncated the EGFr after Gln-996 (E991Qt ), which removes 190 residues from the **' C-terminus of the receptor. The results for each of the cell lines, with the exception of E991Qt (see below) and untransfected CHO **' cells (which showed no detectable specific EGF binding ; results not shown), demonstrated that the wild-type and mutant receptors displayed two distinct populations with different affinities for EGF (Table 1). Scatchard analyses of representative experiments for the wildtype EGFr and the E991Q, E991Qt and Y992E mutant EGFr **' are shown in Figure 1. In all cases except one of the E991Qt ternary complex fits, the **' curves align very well with the data points.

To explore the relationship between the parameters of the ternary complex model (Rt, At, Khi, Klo, KA and K) and those of the two-site model (Rhi, Khi,macro, Rlo, Klo,macro), synthetic binding data were calculated with the ternary complex model [eqn (4)] with four sets of parameters intended to mimic a wild-type EGFr, the Y992E and E991Qt mutant receptors, **' and a receptor for which binding to the A particle of the ternary complex model is disrupted. Lastly, increases in both K and KA are necessary to decrease both high-affinity binding and increase Klo,macro, a situation found for the E991Qt mutant and for **' PMA-treated cells.

The E991Qt mutant, in addition to the Glu 991 Gln point **' mutation, is truncated after Gln-996. This truncation causes a nearly complete loss of the high-affinity binding capacity for EGF in addition to a 3-fold increase in the macroscopic lowaffinity Klo,macro compared with the wild-type and E991Q receptors. The lack of effect of PMA treatment on EGFr binding properties for the E991Qt mutant is consistent with the idea that the region **' of the EGFr that is responsible for regulating the phorbol-esteractivated PKC-induced loss of high affinity of the EGFr lies within the C-terminal 190 residues of the receptor. This sequence has been suggested to be the region of the receptor that determines the high-affinity binding of the EGFr with EGF [12] ; however, its presence in the deletion mutants that do not produce high-affinity receptors (E991Qt shown here) [10] suggests that **' it alone does not confer high-affinity ligand binding capacity.

To analyze the effect of the expression of dnSTAT5 on the colony growth, 32Dcl3/Flt3-ITD cells were electroporated with either 20 g pOPALI/ STAT5Y694F or the same amount of pOPALI/CAT. After transfection of STAT5Y694F (dnSTAT5), the colony formation of 32D/Flt3-ITD1 was reduced by approximately 50%, compared with the transfection of a control vector (Figure 9A).

11342577	Of the six, only the S752P substitution, which also characterizes a form of the human bleeding disorder Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, fails to rescue 3/ osteoclasts or restore ligand-activated signaling in the form of c-src activation. Of the six mutants, only the S752P substitution, which also characterizes a form of the human bleeding disorder Glanzmann's thrombasthenia (12), fails to rescue the spreading and resorptive capacity of 3/ osteoclasts or activate c-src upon ligation. h3(S752P) is the only mutant which obviates rescue of 3/ osteoclasts' capacity to spread. Flow cytometric analysis of transduced BMMs demonstrates that the failure of h3(S752P) to rescue spreading is not due to diminished surface expression of this mutant in osteoclast precursors (Figure 4a). Furthermore, immunofluorescent staining of mature osteoclasts demonstrates persistent expression of h3(S752P) and two other representative mutant 3 cDNAs (Figure 4b). The lacunae formed by h3(S752P), in contrast, appear morphologically similar to those produced by 3/ osteoclasts. Alternatively, 3/ cells bearing h3c, or the h3(S752P) mutant, mirror nontransduced 3/ osteoclasts for these same indices of resorptive activity. Interestingly, while h3c and especially h3(S752P) transductants generate no more pits than do virgin 3/ osteoclasts, they partially normalize pit depth (P < 0.01 compared with both WT and 3/ osteoclasts). Early osteoclasts were generated from 3/ BMMs transduced with h3, h3c, or the h3(S752P) and h3(Y747F/Y759F) mutants. Figure 4 h3(S752P) is effectively expressed by 3/ osteoclasts and their precursors. (a) Flow cytometric analysis of 3/ BMMs nontransduced or transduced with virus encoding h3(D723A), h3(S752P), or h3(Y747F/Y759F), for h3 expression using 1A2 (1A2 + 2oAb). The Journal of Clinical Investigation | May 2001 | Volume 107 | Number 9 1141 Figure 5 3 integrin S752P uniquely regulates osteoclast resorptive activity. (a) 3/ marrow macrophages, either nontransduced (3/) or transduced with retrovirus encoding h3 or its D723A, S752P, or Y747F/Y759F mutants were cultured in osteoclastogenic conditions with ST2 cells on slices of whale dentin for 8 days. In contrast, no such activation occurs in osteoclasts bearing h3c and h3(S752P), mirroring the functional effects of these mutations. This undertaking was complicated by the fact that primary macrophages, which are osteoclast precursors, cannot be transfected with high efficiency Figure 6 Activation of c-src requires the cytoplasmic tail of 3, and is abrogated by the S752P mutation but not the Y747F/Y759F mutation. 3/ BMMs transduced with h3, h3c, or the S752P and Y747F/Y759F mutants were grown in M-CSF and RANKL for 3 days to generate early (not fully spread) osteoclasts. Of the six point mutants known to impact integrin function, only S752P fails to rescue 3/ osteoclasts. Specifically, h3(S752P) fails to rescue both the impaired capacity of 3/ osteoclasts to spread, and the frequency with which they form resorptive lacunae. We find that v3-dependent activation of c-src requires the cytoplasmic domain of 3, and is abrogated by the S752P, but not the Y747F/Y759F, mutation. While the S752P mutation affects both osteoclast and platelet function, the downstream signaling mechanisms appear to be distinct. (29) showed that the S752P mutation disrupts binding of the ligand-induced binding site (LIBS) antibody PAC1, suggesting a defect in insideout signaling. In contrast, we find that osteoclasts expressing h3(S752P) bind AP5, another 3-specific LIBS antibody (R. Given that AP5 recognizes the activated form of v3, this observation suggests that the 3(S752P) mutation, in osteoclasts, arrests outside-in signaling and thus, ligand-induced c-src activation. Similar to platelets (30), the effect of the mutation is specific for proline, as the more conservative mutation, S752A, is as effective as WT h3 in rescuing osteoclast spreading (data not shown). Mirroring spreading, the shallow, poorly-defined pits characteristic of 3/ osteoclasts are completely normalized by h3 and representative, nondisruptive mutants, h3(D723A) and h3(Y747F/Y759F) (Figure 5a). Quantitative analysis reveals that the number of resorptive pits formed and the percent of dentin surface excavated by 3/ osteoclasts transduced with h3 or h3(D723A) are indistinguishable from those generated by WT cells (Figure 5b). Pit depth is also completely rescued in h3 and h3(D723A) cultures. (a) Flow cytometric analysis of 3/ BMMs nontransduced or transduced with virus encoding h3(D723A), h3(S752P), or h3(Y747F/Y759F), for h3 expression using 1A2 (1A2 + 2oAb).

Interestingly, the double mutation Y747F/Y759F, which disrupts platelet function, does not affect the osteoclast. Mirroring spreading, the shallow, poorly-defined pits characteristic of 3/ osteoclasts are completely normalized by h3 and representative, nondisruptive mutants, h3(D723A) and h3(Y747F/Y759F) (Figure 5a).

Similarly we prepared Bmx (E42K/K445R), which has been shown to act as a dominant-negative construct (27). Cells expressing mutant PDGF (Y579F/Y581F) receptors (which fail to bind and activate Src-type kinases) fail to tyrosine phosphorylate DAPP-1 in response to PDGF. Internalization is not absolutely dependent on phosphorylation of Tyr139; however, in endothelial cells expressing PDGF (Y579F/Y581F) receptors, which fail to activate Srctype kinases, PDGF fails to direct normal targeting of DAPP-1 and DAPP-1-containing endosomes are fewer and remain nearer to their site of formation at the cell surface (12).

Both Bmx and Src driven enhancement of PDGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of DAPP-1 was lost in PAE cells transiently expressing DAPP-1 (Y139F) constructs (data not shown).

Phospholipid vesicles with or without PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (final concentration, 10 M) were preincubated with various protein kinases (final concentration, 20 nM) before addition of wild-type (WT) or (Y139F)-thrombin-cleaved GSTDAPP-1 (bacterially derived; GST tag removed by thrombin cleavage, all 1 M final in assay) and [ -32P]ATP.

Production of Recombinant Proteins--GST-DAPP-1 and its R184A, R61M, and Y139F point mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli BL-21 s, purified via their GST tags, cleaved with thrombin while still bound to the glutathione beads or eluted with glutathione, concentrated, and buffer exchanged by gel filtration into 1 phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.01% sodium azide by standard procedures. A variety of purified wild-type, Y139F, R61M (SH2 domain point mutant), and R184A (PH domain point mutant) DAPP-1 preparations (EE-tagged from Sf9 cells; GST-tagged or thrombin-cleaved from bacteria) were used as potential substrates in the presence of mixed phospholipid vesicles containing low molar percentages of various phosphoinositides and [ -32P]ATP. Phosphorylation is very substantially reduced in vivo with DAPP-1 (R61M) constructs (12), but in vitro this construct is phosphorylated like the wild-type protein. We obtained PAE cells expressing various PDGF receptor (PDGF (Y579F/Y581F) or (Y1021F)) constructs from Lars Ronnstrand (Ludwig Institute, Uppsala, Sweden); in contrast to some published work (16), the former construct in these cells has full tyrosine kinase activity. We have assessed tyrosine phosphorylation of DAPP-1 in response to PDGF in clonal cell lines expressing similar numbers of wild-type PDGF receptors, PDGF (Y579F/Y581F) receptors, and PDGF (Y1021F) receptors (Y1021 is the phospholipase C -binding site; Fig. PAE cells stably expressing wild-type (WT), (Y1021F)-PDGF , or (Y579/581F)-PDGF receptors were transfected with EE-DAPP-1, serum-starved, and then stimulated with PDGF (10 ng ml 1) or its vehicle for 5 min. Production of Recombinant Proteins--GST-DAPP-1 and its R184A, R61M, and Y139F point mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli BL-21 s, purified via their GST tags, cleaved with thrombin while still bound to the glutathione beads or eluted with glutathione, concentrated, and buffer exchanged by gel filtration into 1 phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.01% sodium azide by standard procedures.

Furthermore, the presence of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 has no effect on phosphorylation of DAPP-1 R184A (PH domain point mutant that does not bind phosphoinositides (12)) by Src (Fig. Mouse Src (K295R/Y527F) has been shown to act as a dominant-negative construct (26); we identified the equivalent sites in human Src and prepared Src (K298R/Y530F).

Five different mutations were identified, four of which (R248C, S249C, G372C, K652E) were detected in our previous series; the remaining mutation (Y375C) was identified for the first time in this series. The S249C mutation, found in 33 of the 48 mutated tumors, was the most common. The S249C mutation was the most frequent and was found in 33 of the 48 mutated tumors (69%). Five different mutations were identified, four of which (R248C, S249C, G372C, K652E) were detected in our previous series; the remaining mutation (Y375C) was identified for the first time in this series. The S249C mutation (TCC 3 TGC) is the most frequent FGFR3 mutation in bladder tumors (33 of 48, 69%). The Y375C mutation is reported here for the first Figure 1.

Accordingly, all activation loop mutations that were identified in our screen (A380S, L387F, and M388L) mediated resistance to imatinib. It has been reported that pyrido-pyrimidine derivatives are more potent inhibitors of wild-type Bcr-Abl than imatinib,15 and are active against mutant forms of Bcr-Abl that cause resistance to imatinib, including P-loop mutations and the activation loop mutant H396P.16-18 For PD166326, 14 of 16 P-loop mutant colonies came up at 25 nM, a concentration that is below cellular IC50 values of P-loop mutations with PD166326,18 and 2 colonies at 50 nM, which is close to cellular IC50.

Point mutations within the activation loop that were reported in patients (L387F,25 L387M,11 H396P,8 and H396R12) account for 6% of all mutations. Accordingly, all activation loop mutations that were identified in our screen (A380S, L387F, and M388L) mediated resistance to imatinib. However, L387F was detected in a PD166326-resistant colony, and all 3 activation loop mutations, in contrast to H396P,18 mediated marginal but significant shift in dose-response toward PD166326, indicating that the activation loop may be critical for the binding of pyrido-pyrimidines as well. When C-helix mutations (D276G, E281K, and K285N) were engineered into Bcr-Abl and expressed in Ba/F3 cells, all 3 mutants displayed moderate-to-strong resistance to imatinib, but only low to moderate resistance to PD166326 (Figure 3; Table 1).

Y253H, E255K, E255V, and T315I have been shown previously.8,18 Bcr-Abl E355G, when retransfected into parental Ba/F3 cells, caused only a marginal resistance to an extent that may not allow survival in the presence of 25 nM PD166326 (Figure 3; Table 1). In contrast, the subline that was derived from the screen with 25 nM PD166326 expressing E355G displayed a far more resistant phenotype, as evidenced by survival and conservation of phosphorylated Bcr-Abl in the presence of 25 nM PD166326 (Figure 5A-B). However, in contrast to E355G and G250A, dose-response curves for the cell line expressing the engineered F317V mutation exactly matched the doseresponse curves of the subline derived from the screen (data not shown).

T315I made up 13% in our screen emerging with imatinib (T315I is the most frequently detected mutation in patients [20%]), constituting the second most-affected amino acid. The leading exchange with PD166326 was T315I, which was detected in 32% of all mutant colonies, including the only 2 colonies that came up at 100 nM PD166326. It has been shown previously that T315I causes a fully resistant phenotype to both inhibitors.6,16,18 Another contact site is F317.

In these reports, resistance was accompanied by amplification of the Bcr-Abl gene, an increase in Bcr-Abl protein,37-39 and overexpression of P-glycoprotein.39 There is only one report of a point mutation (T315I) in a human myeloid blast crisis KBM5 cell line that was detected after prolonged drug exposure in vitro.40 In our work, specific resistance mutations became frequently apparent in a cell line that was transfected by Bcr-Abl and exposed to inhibitor beginning with the final concentration without gradual increase. T315I, a frequently occurring mutation in imatinib-resistant patients, was the position most frequently affected in PD166326resistant colonies, and constituted the only mutation detected in 2 colonies growing at 100 nM PD166326. When C-helix mutations (D276G, E281K, and K285N) were engineered into Bcr-Abl and expressed in Ba/F3 cells, all 3 mutants displayed moderate-to-strong resistance to imatinib, but only low to moderate resistance to PD166326 (Figure 3; Table 1).

A PD166326-resistant subline expressing F317V also displayed an increased phosphorylation of Bcr-Abl and Stat5 (Figure 5A). However, in contrast to E355G and G250A, dose-response curves for the cell line expressing the engineered F317V mutation exactly matched the doseresponse curves of the subline derived from the screen (data not shown). This is in accordance with the observation that F317V was sufficient to cause a strong resistance to PD166326. F317V causes resistance to PD166326 while preserving sensitivity to imatinib. Ba/F3 cells transfected with Bcr-Abl wild-type (wt) or Bcr-Abl F317V were incubated for 24 and 48 hours without and in the presence of imatinib (wt, ; F317V, ,) or PD166326 (wt, ; F317V, ) at the indicated concentrations. Furthermore the screen with PD166326 identified mutations (F317) that caused strong resistance against PD166326 but mediated only a moderate (F317C and F317L) or no (F317V) resistance to imatinib. In contrast, mutations displaying Bcr-Abl autophosphorylation even at 10 M imatinib and high cellular IC50 values, such as G250E, E255R, or E275K, were abundantly found in our screen in the presence of imatinib.

The IP3R can be specifically blocked by the new cell-permeable IP3R inhibitor xestospongin C (Gafni et al., 1997). blocked the stimulation of pIgR apical transport by dIgA, suggesting that the IP3R is required for stimulation of transcytosis. Consistent with the proposed involvement of the IP3R, we found that several inhibitors reportedly specific for the ryanodine receptor (ryanodine up to 50 M, caffeine up to 1 mM, or ruthenium red up to 50 M) had no effect on dIgA stimulation of transcytosis (our unpublished results). We now report that the calcium comes from IP3-sensitive stores, as indicated by the block of stimulation by the specific IP3R calcium channel inhibitor xestospongin C, and that elevation of [Ca ]i is required for stimulation of transcytosis. The IP3 then acts on IP3Rs that regulate the release of calcium stores, which are located in the apical region of epithelial cells. Indeed, in epithelial cells (including MDCK cells) in addition to the endoplasmic reticulum there exist endosomal and lysosomal calcium stores, which are regulated in a complex manner by at least three IP3R and the two ryanodine receptor isoforms (Tunwell and Lai, 1996; Lee et al., 1997; Yamamoto-Hino et al., 1998). The mutants pIgRA657, pIgR-725t, and pIgR-GpA G83A have been previously described (Breitfeld et al., 1990; Aroeti et al., 1993; Singer and Mostov, 1998). We made chimeras of pIgR containing either the wild-type glycophorin TMD or a nondimerizing mutant, designated pIgR-GpA G83A (Singer and Mostov, 1998). As seen in Figure 10B, pIgR-GpA G83A does not undergo stimulated transcytosis in the presence of ionomycin, dIgA, or even dIgA and ionomycin together. MDCK cells expressing pIgRGpA (A) or pIgR-GpA G83A (B) were submitted to the simplified postmicrotubule-dependent assay. If phosphorylation is prevented by mutation of Ser-664 to Ala, the pIgR, after endocytosis, recycles back to the basolateral surface instead of undergoing transcytosis. 
11509660	We observed that a point mutation in the first coiled-coil domain (L145P) dramatically increased Fes tyrosine kinase and transforming activities in this cell type. However, combining the L334P and L145P mutations reduced transforming and kinase activities by approximately 50% relative to the levels of activity produced with the L145P mutation alone. In this cellular context, the L145P mutation induced GM-CSF independence, cell attachment, and spreading. These effects correlated with a marked increase in L145P protein autophosphorylation relative to that of wild-type Fes. Both individual-mutation (L145P, L334P) and double-mutation (2LP) proteins were created. Data are presented as percentages of attached cells observed relative to the number of attached cells of the GFPFes L145P mutant protein, which gave the strongest response. The proteins with the resulting coiled-coil mutations (L145P, L334P, and 2LP) were fused to GFP in a retroviral vector for expression in fibroblasts and human myeloid progenitor cells. The mutant proteins include one with a proline substitution for Leu 145 in the CC1 domain (L145P) protein, one with a proline substitution for Leu 334 in the CC2 domain (L334P protein), and a double mutant protein with both substitutions (2LP). Mutant proteins include one with a proline substitution for Leu 145 in the first coiled-coil domain (L145P), one with a proline substitution for Leu 334 in the CC2 domain (L334P), and the corresponding double mutant protein with both substitutions (2LP). However, this same substitution reduced the kinase activity of the L145P mutant protein by more than 50%, suggesting that an intact CC2 domain is required for efficient autophosphorylation in vivo. We observed that a GFP-Fes deletion mutant protein lacking the CC1 domain (GFP- CC1) exhibited approximately 80% of the kinase activity of the GFP-L145P mutant protein (Fig. However, the L145P mutant protein exhibited very potent focus-forming activity, consistent with the effect of this mutation on Fes autophosphorylation. Combining the CC1 and CC2 mutations reduced focus-forming activity by more than 50% relative to that of the L145P single mutant protein. GFP-Fes CC1 protein exhibited strong focus-forming activity, although the number of foci observed was about 50% of that observed with the L145P mutant protein (Fig. TF-1 cells were infected with recombinant retroviruses carrying GFP as a negative control (open bars), GFP-Fes (gray bars), GFP-Fes L145P protein (hatched bars), or GFP-Fes 2LP (solid bars). However, cells expressing the Fes protein with the CC1 domain point mutation (L145P) grew rapidly in the absence of cytokine, providing direct evidence that Fes kinase activity is sufficient to generate a signal for survival and proliferation in myeloid cells. Images of cells expressing the GFP-Fes CC1 domain point mutant (L145P) protein were recorded under low-power (middle left panel) and high-power ( 400; middle right panel) magnification. This effect was unique to the GFP-Fes L145P protein, as cells expressing GFP alone, wild-type GFP-Fes, the CC2 point mutant protein, or the CC1 2 mutant protein did not attach or spread. Addition of the L334P mutation in the CC2 domain substantially reduced the kinase activity of GFP-Fes L145P protein. The GFP-CC1 2 fusion protein with the CC1 point mutation (L145P) showed a dramatic shift from the monomeric to multiple oligomeric forms, including the peak 2 and peak 3 forms observed with wild-type Fes CC1 2 as well as an additional oligomer of higher molecular weight (peak 4). This result shows that the L145P mutation promotes oligomerization of the N-terminal region and is consistent with the hypothesis that this mutation activates Fes in vivo by disrupting intramo- VOL. Results are shown for wild-type GFP-Fes CC1 2 (WT), the CC1 mutation (L145P) protein, the CC2 mutation (L334P) protein, and the double mutant protein (2LP). From top to bottom these include wild-type GFP-Fes CC1 2, the CC1 point mutant (L145P) protein, the CC2 point mutant (L334P) protein, and the double mutant protein. The activating effect of the L145P mutation was reversed when combined with a proline substitution for Leu 334 in the more C-terminal region of coiled-coil homology. However, only the L145P mutant protein is active in cells, suggesting that oligomers formed by the L334P mutant protein are not compatible with kinase activation or signaling function. The L145P mutation in the CC1 domain represents the first gain-of-function mutation described for Fes that is independent of an artificial membrane-targeting signal. Although a Fes L145P mutant protein without GFP could be transiently expressed in 293T cells and exhibited very high levels of tyrosine kinase activity relative to that of the wild-type kinase (data not shown), attempts to produce lines of Rat-2 cells that stably express this mutant were unsuccessful. Expression of the L145P mutant protein of Fes resulted in cytokine-independent proliferation of TF-1 cells, providing evidence that Fes may activate downstream signaling pathways that regulate cellular survival. In addition, constitutive activation of Fes as a result of the L145P mutation caused attachment and spreading of TF-1 cells, consistent with previous work implicating Fes in the terminal differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells (4, 34, 40). Both the survival and differentiation effects of the L145P mutation were almost completely reversed in the double mutant protein (2LP), suggesting that an intact CC2 domain is required for efficient kinase activation or downstream signaling in myeloid cell types. Interestingly, the CC2 mutation did not have as dramatic an impact on the transforming function of the GFP-Fes L145P protein following ectopic expression in Rat-2 cells. In contrast, a similar point mutation in the second coiled-coil motif (L334P) was without effect. However, combining the L334P and L145P mutations reduced transforming and kinase activities by approximately 50% relative to the levels of activity produced with the L145P mutation alone. Both individual-mutation (L145P, L334P) and double-mutation (2LP) proteins were created. The proteins with the resulting coiled-coil mutations (L145P, L334P, and 2LP) were fused to GFP in a retroviral vector for expression in fibroblasts and human myeloid progenitor cells. The mutant proteins include one with a proline substitution for Leu 145 in the CC1 domain (L145P) protein, one with a proline substitution for Leu 334 in the CC2 domain (L334P protein), and a double mutant protein with both substitutions (2LP). Mutant proteins include one with a proline substitution for Leu 145 in the first coiled-coil domain (L145P), one with a proline substitution for Leu 334 in the CC2 domain (L334P), and the corresponding double mutant protein with both substitutions (2LP). Phase-contrast images of TF-1 cells expressing GFP, GFP-Fes, GFP-Fes L334P, and GFP-2LP were recorded under low-power magnification ( 100). with the CC2 domain point mutation (L334P) was unable to support cytokine-independent proliferation of TF-1 cells, consistent with the fibroblast result (data not shown). Addition of the L334P mutation in the CC2 domain substantially reduced the kinase activity of GFP-Fes L145P protein. These results correlate with both the survival and the differentiation responses in TF-1 cells and with the transforming and kinase activities of these mutant proteins in the fibroblast transformation assay, although the suppressive effect of the L334P mutation is more pronounced in TF-1 cells (see Discussion). Results are shown for wild-type GFP-Fes CC1 2 (WT), the CC1 mutation (L145P) protein, the CC2 mutation (L334P) protein, and the double mutant protein (2LP). Mutation of the CC2 domain (L334P) within GFP-CC1 2 also favored oligomerization, almost exclusively to the peak 3 form. However, the full-length L334P mutant protein lacks activity both in fibroblasts and in TF-1 cells, suggesting that a wild-type CC2 domain is essential for kinase activity and/or interaction with signaling partners in vivo (see Discussion). From top to bottom these include wild-type GFP-Fes CC1 2, the CC1 point mutant (L145P) protein, the CC2 point mutant (L334P) protein, and the double mutant protein. However, only the L145P mutant protein is active in cells, suggesting that oligomers formed by the L334P mutant protein are not compatible with kinase activation or signaling function.

15973458	BCR-ABL gene amplification and mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain are the most frequent mechanisms of resistance.1 Mutations causing amino-acid substitution can be classified into four groups: (i) in the imatinib binding site-like T315I mutation, (ii) in the P-loop (ATP phosphate binding loop for ATP) like G250E mutation, (iii) in the activation loop, and (iv) in the C-terminal lobe of the enzyme.13 In the current study, we investigated a new mutation in the P-loop domain G250A detected in a resistant patient. An in vitro functional study was performed using G250A mutant compared to a G250E mutant already characterized and to one of the most resistant mutant T315I engineered in Baf/BCR-ABL cells. To evaluate the role of this substitution on the imatinib resistance of leukemic cells, we generated three different plasmids by site-directed mutagenesis: a wild-type (wt) BCRABL, a G250A mutation and a G250E mutation, from the 9.5 kb plasmid pEYK3.1 containing the complete BCR-ABL sequence with the T315I mutation (kindly provided by G Daley2). Baf/ BCR-ABL cells were transfected with the different mutants, named Baf/BCR-ABL wt, Baf/BCR-ABL T315I, Baf/BCR-ABL G250E and Baf/BCR-ABL G250A, and tested for imatinib sensitivity with increasing doses of imatinib (0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5 and 10 mM). In contrast, the Baf/BCR-ABL T315I and G250E cells were resistant to the inhibitor. Cellular Spotlight Correspondence 1672 proliferation evaluated using MTS assay showed that at day 4, the dose of imatinib needed to inhibit 50% of proliferation was more than 10 mM for T315I and G250E mutants as compared to 0.5 mM for G250A and 0.1 mM for the wt (Figure 1). Western blot analysis demonstrated no decrease in STAT5 phosphorylation in the Baf/BCR-ABL T315I or G250E (Figure 2). These results confirmed the resistance to imatinib observed in culture using MTS assay for G250E or T315I mutants.

This appears to be similar to the findings for G250E and G250A and undermines the tenet that different substitutions of T315 always lead to the same resistance level, as reported by other groups.7 Results from previous studies have demonstrated that the T315I mutation is more resistant than G250E.2,8 In conclusion, this is the first report of intermediate resistance observed clinically, confirmed in vitro and correlated with slow clinical evolution in a CML patient. Different amino acid substitutions at the same position leading to different levels of resistance have also been reported.2 Corbin et al6 also measured the IC50 values of two mutations at T315 and found different levels of resistance for T315I and T315 V. BCR-ABL gene amplification and mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain are the most frequent mechanisms of resistance.1 Mutations causing amino-acid substitution can be classified into four groups: (i) in the imatinib binding site-like T315I mutation, (ii) in the P-loop (ATP phosphate binding loop for ATP) like G250E mutation, (iii) in the activation loop, and (iv) in the C-terminal lobe of the enzyme.13 In the current study, we investigated a new mutation in the P-loop domain G250A detected in a resistant patient. An in vitro functional study was performed using G250A mutant compared to a G250E mutant already characterized and to one of the most resistant mutant T315I engineered in Baf/BCR-ABL cells. A new G250A (substitution of a glycine by an alanine) mutation was identified in our patient's group. This revealed the G250A mutation in January 2002 but not in January 2001 (start of imatinib therapy). To evaluate the role of this substitution on the imatinib resistance of leukemic cells, we generated three different plasmids by site-directed mutagenesis: a wild-type (wt) BCRABL, a G250A mutation and a G250E mutation, from the 9.5 kb plasmid pEYK3.1 containing the complete BCR-ABL sequence with the T315I mutation (kindly provided by G Daley2). Baf/ BCR-ABL cells were transfected with the different mutants, named Baf/BCR-ABL wt, Baf/BCR-ABL T315I, Baf/BCR-ABL G250E and Baf/BCR-ABL G250A, and tested for imatinib sensitivity with increasing doses of imatinib (0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5 and 10 mM). The viability test demonstrated that G250A nucleotide substitution conferred resistance to imatinib because 88% of cells were still alive after 4 days with 0.5 mM of imatinib. Cellular Spotlight Correspondence 1672 proliferation evaluated using MTS assay showed that at day 4, the dose of imatinib needed to inhibit 50% of proliferation was more than 10 mM for T315I and G250E mutants as compared to 0.5 mM for G250A and 0.1 mM for the wt (Figure 1). In contrast, STAT5 phosphorylation for Baf/BCR-ABL wt was lower than for Baf/ BCR-ABL G250A (Figure 2).

Indeed, imatinib inhibition might be precluded by modifying the active drug concentration, thus accounting for the in vivo resistance observed in spite of the intermediate resistance demonstrated in vitro for the G250A mutation. This appears to be similar to the findings for G250E and G250A and undermines the tenet that different substitutions of T315 always lead to the same resistance level, as reported by other groups.7 Results from previous studies have demonstrated that the T315I mutation is more resistant than G250E.2,8 In conclusion, this is the first report of intermediate resistance observed clinically, confirmed in vitro and correlated with slow clinical evolution in a CML patient.

Eight novel VEGFR-3 mutations (G854S, A915P, C916W, G933R, R1041W, R1041Q, del F 1108, and P1137L) and eight polymorphic variations, four of which have been previously reported,19 were identified among the 12 families (tables 2 and 3). Furthermore, another mutation in this GXGXXG kinase motif has been found independently in a family with PCL (G857R).13 The P1137L mutation occurs in subdomain X, which corresponds to the larger COOH-terminal lobe, mainly responsible for binding the peptide substrate and initiating phosphotransfer. It is predominantly a helical in content.21 The P1137L mutation occurs within the tyrosine kinase domain II. Seven of the mutations are missense mutations, as is the type of mutation found previously, and one is a deletion mutation, which has not so far been reported.12 13 We have also found eight polymorphic variations (N149D, 507 G.T, T494A, Q890H, P954S, P1008L, R1146H, and R1324L).

All polymorphisms found in this study, with the exception of one (P1008L), were either ones which had previously been reported (N149D, 507 G.T, T494A, and R1146H)19 or were present in normal controls at a frequency greater than 1% (Q890H (16%), P954S (3%), and R1324L (28%)). The P1008L substitution, in PCL-902, was found in only two (II:1 and II:4) of six affected family members tested, and so is not seen to be causative. Furthermore, upon closer inspection of the haplotype data, it became apparent that the two individuals with the P1008L substitution had both inherited the same normal haplotype from their parent (presumably individual I:2), which was not inherited by any other family members. This suggests that the P1008L mutation is being transmitted along with the ``normal'' allele and hence it is likely to be a rare polymorphism, although it has not been found in 50 normal controls tested (fig 3).

Eight novel VEGFR-3 mutations (G854S, A915P, C916W, G933R, R1041W, R1041Q, del F 1108, and P1137L) and eight polymorphic variations, four of which have been previously reported,19 were identified among the 12 families (tables 2 and 3). Mutations R1041Q and R1041W involve the same codon in the region of VEGFR-3 encoding the tyrosine kinase domain II. The catalytic sites of many receptor tyrosine kinases contain a conserved HRDLAARN sequence, of which R1041 in VEGFR-3 corresponds to the second arginine.12 21 Previous studies have shown that mutations affecting this residue resulted in proteins with an inactive tyrosine kinase which prevented downstream gene activation.13 Hence R1041Q and R1041W could be predicted to have the same effect, suggesting that mutations interfering with VEGFR-3 signal transduction are the cause of primary lymphoedema in these two families.

In this report we describe 12 PCL families consistent with linkage to the 5q35.3 region and report eight novel mutations (G854S, A915P, C916W, G933R, R1041W, R1041Q, del F 1108, and P1137L), two of which each occur in two separate families. The same allele is shared between PCL-163 and PCL-902 (sharing the mutation G933R) and between PCL-101 and PCL-102 (sharing the mutation G933R) for the two SNPs and the most telomeric marker, D5S2006. www.jmedgenet.com Downloaded from jmg.bmjjournals.com on 5 December 2005 Letter 699 Table 1 Details of primers used to sequence VEGFR-3 and conditions for amplification Annealing temperature (C ) 64 66 65 64 64 65 61 65 59 61 61 65 61 65 65 65 65 55 65 65 61 63 56 64 56 67 65 55 65 60 Magnesium concentration (mmol/l) 1.5 1.5 1 1.5 1.5 1.5 1 1.5 1 1 1 1.5 1 1.5 1 1.5 1.5 1 1 1 1 1.5 1.5 1.5 1 1 1 1.5 1.5 1.5 Exon 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 Forward primer ccgcgcggacactttcagcc cgatgcagaatgcccagccatg ctggtgaggctcggcctgag tggctggttcaggaccagcac ctgtctggccaggagcaagg gggctgtcactgcctcactgg gacgcggggcttccctg cctggtcagtccacgacggg gggccctgacctcccttc cagctgaccggccatctg ctgcccttgcctcttctg gcacagcgacctccttgcag tgccacagggcttcttcc gtcctcctgctaagtgcagctc gtccggaggcccgcgaggc gcaagtcgtggccaccagaag ctgtcctgggcaaagttctgcc tgtctccacgctcaccc tgccttagctaagcggccagtg cgcgggtgcaaacgcggagc gccctcgagccagcttcg acatgcttgttagctgttccctg gagttgacctcccaaggt ttcaacccaggcagaggaccc caggacggggtgacttga gggcactgaaggtcctgggac gctgagggcagtggctggtg cctcagcaccttctgatttc ggtggctgccctgcaggagg tactaacaccaccttccctg Reverse primer gtacccggcggagcggtctc cacagccaccacctcctgcc agcccagggtccacaggctg ccttgctcctggccagacag caggacgacacccactgagg cagtgtgtgctgtacagtcacag cacaaggaccctggtttcc tctccgtgtgcaggtcctgac cccgtgcgctctcccgtc ggggacctgaggctggag gggcactcagcagcgcg ctcaatgagcccaaacctgcc gtccccgccctccccg gcctcgcgggcctccggac cttctggtggccacgacttgc gaactagggcgggcaccttattc atggagggattcaggcactccg ccgctgaccccacacctt gctccgcgtttgcacccgcg cgcagaggcgcctccattcc aggaaaagggaagaggccag caagcacttcttggcgactggt tctcctggacaggcagtc cgtaacctgccgccagtgacc gcccaggcctgtctactg gcagctcgggccagggacc aaatgcaccttgtccacatggc cccacccttcatgtgaagt ggagggcaacatcgatacctgc gtgctgggggtcttgtcc Table 2 Family PCL-163 PCL-902 PCL-100 PCL-900 PCL-101 PCL-102 PCL-001 PCL-107 PCL-66 PCL-144 Summary of mutations found in the VEGFR-3 gene Position Ex Ex Ex Ex Ex Ex Ex Ex Ex 18 18 19 19 20 20 23 23 24 Nucleotide position Amino acid substitution Domain TK TK TK TK TK TK TK TK TK I domain I domain I domain I domain I domain I domain II domain II domain II domain Type of change Missense Missense Missense Missense Missense Missense Missense Missense Deletion mutation mutation mutation mutation mutation mutation mutation mutation Ex 25 2560 G.A G854S 2560 G.A G854S 2743 G.C A915P 2748 C.G C916W 2797 G.C G933R 2797 G.C G933R 3121 C.T R1041W 3122 G.A R1041Q nt 3323-3325 del del F 1108 TCT 3410 C.T P1137L TK II domain Missense mutation IV:4, IV:5, and IV:7) and their mother (individual II:2) was believed to be affected.

Eight novel VEGFR-3 mutations (G854S, A915P, C916W, G933R, R1041W, R1041Q, del F 1108, and P1137L) and eight polymorphic variations, four of which have been previously reported,19 were identified among the 12 families (tables 2 and 3). The G854S, A915P, C916W, and G933R mutations all occur in the tyrosine kinase domain I, which is also known to be important for the catalytic activity of protein kinases and so could again be predicted to result in a defective receptor.13 21 The G854S mutation affects the second glycine residue in the conserved GXGXXG kinase motif, which forms a critical portion of the ATP-binding site. Seven of the mutations are missense mutations, as is the type of mutation found previously, and one is a deletion mutation, which has not so far been reported.12 13 We have also found eight polymorphic variations (N149D, 507 G.T, T494A, Q890H, P954S, P1008L, R1146H, and R1324L).

Eight novel VEGFR-3 mutations (G854S, A915P, C916W, G933R, R1041W, R1041Q, del F 1108, and P1137L) and eight polymorphic variations, four of which have been previously reported,19 were identified among the 12 families (tables 2 and 3). Mutations R1041Q and R1041W involve the same codon in the region of VEGFR-3 encoding the tyrosine kinase domain II. The catalytic sites of many receptor tyrosine kinases contain a conserved HRDLAARN sequence, of which R1041 in VEGFR-3 corresponds to the second arginine.12 21 Previous studies have shown that mutations affecting this residue resulted in proteins with an inactive tyrosine kinase which prevented downstream gene activation.13 Hence R1041Q and R1041W could be predicted to have the same effect, suggesting that mutations interfering with VEGFR-3 signal transduction are the cause of primary lymphoedema in these two families. Furthermore, another mutation in this GXGXXG kinase motif has been found independently in a family with PCL (G857R).13 The P1137L mutation occurs in subdomain X, which corresponds to the larger COOH-terminal lobe, mainly responsible for binding the peptide substrate and initiating phosphotransfer. 
11564857	Cys6183Arg mutation in the RET proto-oncogene associated with familial medullary thyroid carcinoma and maternally transmitted Hirschsprung's disease suggesting a role for imprinting. The human cDNA coding for the short isoform of RET (Ret9, 1,072 amino acids) was cloned into the pAlter vector (Promega) and site-directed mutagenesis of Cys6093Trp (TGC3TGG), Cys6203Arg (TGC3CGC), Cys6343 Arg (TGC3CGC), and Met9183Thr (ATG3ACG) was performed, as already described (36). The SK-N-MC cell line was stably transfected with WT or Cys634 3 Arg-mutated RET9 isoform cDNA. The human cDNA coding for the short isoform of RET (Ret9, 1,072 amino acids) was cloned into the pAlter vector (Promega) and site-directed mutagenesis of Cys6093Trp (TGC3TGG), Cys6203Arg (TGC3CGC), Cys6343 Arg (TGC3CGC), and Met9183Thr (ATG3ACG) was performed, as already described (36).

To address this issue, we have studied the consequences on cell survival of the Met9183Thr RET substitution (Ret2B), another gain-of-function mutation responsible for MEN2B that has never been associated with HSCR. 
11598108	In contrast, mutation of the residues R63W and P158L did not significantly affect tyrosine phosphorylation. The time course of two of the mutants tested (P158L and P168L) showed a similar pattern of activation compared with the wild type. However, the amounts of G143D and P158L retained on the beads Collagen-binding Epitopes in DDR1 45955 FIG. A range of different concentrations of protein lysates from cells expressing wild type (WT) DDR1 or R63W and P158L mutant were used for the receptor-ligand binding assay.

Next, we selected two mutants, R63W and P158L, for the receptor-ligand binding assay. The mutant R63W showed no significant difference in collagen affinity compared with the wild type, whereas P158L had a drastically impaired collagen-binding capacity. Over a range of 4 orders of magnitude in protein concentration (1 ng to 10 g), the R63W mutant showed only an approximately 10% reduction in collagen affinity, whereas the binding of P158L was about 3 4-fold lower than the wild type. The opposite seemed to be the case for P158L, which is equally strong activated by collagen but has significantly less affinity to collagen compared with the wild type. In a direct ligand-binding assay, we detected a significantly lower binding to collagen with two mutants (G143D and P158L) but a higher affinity with the mutants R179W and E181Q. Surprisingly, although the mutant P158L was fully activated upon ligand stimulation, it failed to properly adhere to collagen. We found that four of the nine mutants (G36S, W73C, R179W, and E181Q) showed markedly reduced phosphorylation compared with the wild type (Table I). Signals for the mutants W73C, G104R, and P168L were slightly lower compared with the wild type (Table I).

Mutation of W73C, G104R, or G143D simultaneously affected collagen binding and receptor activation. Indeed, seven of the DDR1 mutants showed reduced activation of the kinase function in response to collagen (G36S, W73C, G104R, G143D, P168L, R179W, and E181Q). In contrast, mutation of the residues R63W and P158L did not significantly affect tyrosine phosphorylation. Two of the nine mutants (G36S and R63W) bound equally well to collagen beads as the wild type (Fig. A range of different concentrations of protein lysates from cells expressing wild type (WT) DDR1 or R63W and P158L mutant were used for the receptor-ligand binding assay.

The mutation in one of nine conserved residues (R63W) did 45956 Collagen-binding Epitopes in DDR1 FIG. One out of the nine mutated positions remained relatively unchanged in its collagen-binding properties compared with the wild type (R63W). We found that four of the nine mutants (G36S, W73C, R179W, and E181Q) showed markedly reduced phosphorylation compared with the wild type (Table I). Moreover, phosphorylation of the mutants G36S and R179W were significantly reduced but had no effect on the time course of activation.

In a direct ligand-binding assay, we detected a significantly lower binding to collagen with two mutants (G143D and P158L) but a higher affinity with the mutants R179W and E181Q. We found that four of the nine mutants (G36S, W73C, R179W, and E181Q) showed markedly reduced phosphorylation compared with the wild type (Table I). Finally, the mutant E181Q had no detectable increase of phosphorylation during the time period studied.

Indeed, seven of the DDR1 mutants showed reduced activation of the kinase function in response to collagen (G36S, W73C, G104R, G143D, P168L, R179W, and E181Q). Purification and Analysis of Recombinant Mutant Discoidin Domain from DDR1--To compare the folding of wild type and mutated DDR1 discoidin domains, the respective cDNAs coding for amino acids 28 186 of wild type and of the G36S mutant were cloned into the pET30 vector. The G36S mutant had almost identical -sheet content and a slightly higher percentage of -helices. We found that four of the nine mutants (G36S, W73C, R179W, and E181Q) showed markedly reduced phosphorylation compared with the wild type (Table I). Moreover, phosphorylation of the mutants G36S and R179W were significantly reduced but had no effect on the time course of activation. The discoidin domain of wild type and G36S mutant were expressed as His tag fusion protein in bacteria. Wild type and G36S mutant proteins were analyzed by CD spectroscopy (B). Two of the nine mutants (G36S and R63W) bound equally well to collagen beads as the wild type (Fig. Wild type G36S R63W W73C G104R G143D P158L P168L R179W E181Q 100 108.3 5.9 94.9 3.0 95.3 1.5 112.2 1.7 101.6 5.6 91.4 1.9 109.7 10.9 103.7 5.9 112.7 3.4 100 54.4 3.8 93.2 7.7 43.4 5.9 70.5 5.0 68.2 6.2 114.7 11.7 73.8 9.8 34.1 3.2 40.9 6.3 100 83.6 98.1 65.6 74.1 58.9 47.4 73.2 187.6 183.7 9.9 9.0 5.8 0.8 7.0 4.3 3.8 5.9 2.9 were much lower, indicating a loss of collagen binding affinity. The two mutants G36S and P168L were still able to significantly bind to collagen, but they failed to be fully tyrosine-phosphorylated. Indeed, seven of the DDR1 mutants showed reduced activation of the kinase function in response to collagen (G36S, W73C, G104R, G143D, P168L, R179W, and E181Q). Nevertheless, similar expression levels between wild type and mutant molecules on the one hand and expression of the G36S mutant in bacteria followed by CD experiments on the other hand suggested that mutant proteins should be correctly folded. A slight reduction of about 30% was observed with G104R, G143D, and P168L. The time course of two of the mutants tested (P158L and P168L) showed a similar pattern of activation compared with the wild type. Signals for the mutants W73C, G104R, and P168L were slightly lower compared with the wild type (Table I).

9826708	Interestingly, the mutations found within the kinase domain of RET (M918T) and KIT (D816V) are located in codons that are homologous to those mutated in MET (M1250T, D1228N, and D1228H). Molecular modeling indicated that some of the mutations (D1228N, D1228H, Y1230C, Y1230H, and M1250T) alter residues located in the activation loop (22). Minor changes in substrate specificity, compared with wild-type MET, were observed in the Y1230H, D1228H, and D1228N mutants. The receptors harboring the Y1230C, Y1230H, D1228H, D1228N, and M1250T mutations were found to be tyrosine-phosphorylated in intact cells (Fig. The increase varies from 2- to 3-fold for the M1131T, Y1230C, and Y1230H mutants to 5- to 7-fold for the V1220I, D1228H, D1228N, and M1250T mutants. We found that receptors harboring the Y1230H, D1228H, D1228N, and M1250T mutations were constitutively associated with signal transducers (Fig. Interestingly, the mutations found within the kinase domain of RET (M918T) and KIT (D816V) are located in codons that are homologous to those mutated in MET (M1250T, D1228N, and D1228H).

We found that receptors harboring the Y1230H, D1228H, D1228N, and M1250T mutations were constitutively associated with signal transducers (Fig. (C) Lysates of COS cells expressing either the wild-type (wt), the D1228H mutant, or its double phenylalanine counterpart D1228H (FF) were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Met antibodies. (D) Lysates of NIH 3T3 cells expressing the D1228H mutant were incubated with the YpVNV phosphopeptide corresponding to the receptor's docking site and immunoprecipitated with anti-Gab1 antibodies. (A) The invasive potential of the D1228H mutants and of its signaling-inactive counterpart D1228H (FF) was evaluated by measuring the ability to invade reconstituted basal membranes made of laminin, collagen type IV, and proteoglycans (Matrigel). (B) The invasive growth of the D1228H mutant was evaluated by measuring the sprouting and migration into a threedimensional network of collagen type I. Human kidney cells (BOSC-23) either nontransfected (N.T.) or transiently expressing the D1228H receptor were seeded in collagen gels and grown for 5 days. The tyrosinephosphorylated peptide, but not its phenylalanine counterpart, prevented invasion of the reconstituted basement membrane by cells transformed by the D1228H mutant (Fig. The same phosphorylated peptide specifically inhibited sprouting and migration of cells transformed by the D1228H mutant into a three-dimensional network of collagen (Fig. Interestingly, the mutations found within the kinase domain of RET (M918T) and KIT (D816V) are located in codons that are homologous to those mutated in MET (M1250T, D1228N, and D1228H).

We found that receptors harboring the Y1230H, D1228H, D1228N, and M1250T mutations were constitutively associated with signal transducers (Fig. Molecular modeling indicated that some of the mutations (D1228N, D1228H, Y1230C, Y1230H, and M1250T) alter residues located in the activation loop (22).

METPRC mutations result in increased kinase activity and--in some instances, i.e., M1250T substitution--in changes in substrate specificity. Interestingly, the mutations found within the kinase domain of RET (M918T) and KIT (D816V) are located in codons that are homologous to those mutated in MET (M1250T, D1228N, and D1228H). Molecular modeling indicated that some of the mutations (D1228N, D1228H, Y1230C, Y1230H, and M1250T) alter residues located in the activation loop (22). As expected (12), a correlation was found between the catalytic properties and the transforming ability, which was most marked for M1250T, the mutation occurring in RET in the MEN2B syndrome (2, 10). A more marked shift in substrate specificity was observed with the M1250T mutant, which phosphorylated more efficiently peptides that are optimal substrates for cytosolic tyrosine kinases such as Abl (Fig. It should be noted however, that even the M1250T mutant phosphorylates the tail peptide with higher efficiency (3-fold) than any other peptide substrate (Fig. We next assessed whether, in view of its altered substrate specificity, the M1250T mutant was able to phosphorylate cellular substrates that are normally phosphorylated by the Abl tyrosine kinase, among which are Crk and p130CAS (32). We found that in NIH 3T3 cells transfected with the M1250T mutant and other METPRC mutants, the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of p130CAS was slightly increased with respect to control or wild-type transfected cells, whereas the levels of Crk phosphorylation were unaffected (data not shown). The receptors harboring the Y1230C, Y1230H, D1228H, D1228N, and M1250T mutations were found to be tyrosine-phosphorylated in intact cells (Fig. The increase varies from 2- to 3-fold for the M1131T, Y1230C, and Y1230H mutants to 5- to 7-fold for the V1220I, D1228H, D1228N, and M1250T mutants.

9736610	Detection of a similar PH domain mutation, R28H, in a patient with classical XLA suggested that the distinction between the two phenotypes did not result from an allelic difference (DeWeers et al., 1994a). The B cell defects in the CBA/N xid mice which carry an R28C mutation in the Btk PH domain are less severe (Wicker and Scher, 1986). The EMBO Journal Vol.17 No.18 pp.53095320, 1998 Severe B cell deficiency and disrupted splenic architecture in transgenic mice expressing the E41K mutated form of Bruton's tyrosine kinase Gemma M.Dingjan1,2, Alex Maas1, Martijn C.Nawijn2, Linda Smit3, Jane S.A.Voerman2, Frank Grosveld1 and Rudolf W.Hendriks1,4 of Cell Biology and Genetics and 2Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Dr Molewaterplein 50, P.O. In contrast, expression of a constitutively activated form of Btk carrying the E41K gain-of-function mutation resulted in a B cell defect that was more severe than xid. Expression of the E41K Btk mutant enhanced blast formation of splenic B cells in vitro in response to antiIgM stimulation. These concerted phosphorylation events were shown to be enhanced by a Glu-to-Lys mutation, E41K, in the PH domain of Btk (Park et al., 1996). The E41K mutant, which was isolated using a retroviral random mutagenesis scheme, was shown to induce transformation of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts in soft agar cultures and factor-independent growth of the IL-5dependent pro-B cell line Y16 (Li et al., 1995). The transforming activity of the E41K mutation is associated with increased membrane localization and tyrosine 5309 G.M.Dingjan et al. The activating nature of the E41K mutation might be explained by its close proximity to the predicted inositol-phosphate binding site, as was indicated by X-ray crystallography studies (Hyvonen and Saraste, 1997). In this context, the E41K mutant binds inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6hexakiphosphate with a 2 higher affinity than wild-type Btk (Fukada et al., 1996). To be able to identify signaling pathways that are activated by Btk in vivo, we have now modified the MHCII-hBtk transgene construct and generated two different types of transgenic mice, which either overexpress wild-type hBtk, or express various levels of the E41K gain-of-function Btk mutant. In contrast, E41K hBtk mutant mice manifested an immunodeficient phenotype that is more severe than xid and is characterized by very low numbers of circulating B cells, an almost complete absence of B cell responses in vivo and a disruption of the cellular architecture of the spleen. Results Generation of WT-hBtk and E41K-hBtk transgenic mice The constructs used in this study containing either the wild-type (WT-hBtk) or the E41K mutant (E41K-hBtk) Btk gene, as well as the MHCII-hBtk construct previously used to obtain transgenic Btk expression (Drabek et al., 1997), are shown in Figure 1A. The E41K mutation was Fig. The WT-hBtk and E41K-hBtk transgenes contain a 27.4 kb hBtk cDNAgenomic DNA fusion segment with exons 119, as well as a loxP sequence. A polyclonal rabbit antiserum was used, which was raised against fusion proteins of gluthatione S-transferase (GST) and amino acids 163218 of hBtk and also recognized E41K hBtk or murine Btk. Single splenic cell suspensions from 3-month-old nontransgenic Btk or Btk mice, as well as WT-hBtk or E41K-hBtk transgenic mice on the Btk background were stained for surface B220 and IgM and subsequently for intracellular Btk. 5310 E41K Btk transgenic mice introduced by a G to A replacement at position 257, using in vitro site-directed mutagenesis. The transgene constructs were microinjected into fertilized oocytes and four independent E41K-hBtk transgenic lines (#8, #10, #11 and #14) and three WT-hBtk transgenic lines (G5, F2 and A5) were obtained. Expression levels of the E41K and WT hBtk proteins Btk protein expression was evaluated in transgenic mice on the Btk background by Western blotting of total spleen cell lysates (Figure 1B). To estimate the Btk expression levels of the individual transgenic mouse lines, the densities of the Western blot Btk protein signals were quantified and corrected for the proportion of B cells in the spleen (which were significantly lower in the E41K-hBtk transgenic mice; see below). In contrast to the MHCII-hBtk transgenic mice which showed approximately endogenous Btk levels, the WT- and E41KhBtk mice manifested up to 14 overexpression of hBtk in their splenocytes (Figure 1B). The experiments described below were mainly performed on WT-hBtk line A5, and on E41K-hBtk line #8. Except where specifically indicated, no differences were detected between independent lines in the performed analyses, either for the WT-hBtk or the E41K-hBtk transgenic mice. Using intracellular flow cytometry, we compared the expression levels of transgenic WT and E41K hBtk with the endogenous murine Btk during B cell differentiation. In constrast, a significant increase in WT or E41K transgenic hBtk protein was found as B cells maturated from IgMhigh to IgMlow cells in the spleen (Figure 1C). When transfected into NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, the E41K Btk mutant manifested enhanced auto-phosphorylation and increased membrane targeting, while the in vitro kinase activity was similar to wild-type Btk (Li et al., 1995). However, when we analyzed unstimulated splenocytes, whether from normal mice, WT-hBtk or E41K-hBtk transgenic mice, the majority of Btk protein was found in the cytosolic fraction. Also, in vivo tyrosine phosphorylation or in vitro autokinase activity of the hBtk protein in these cells did not appear to be enhanced by the E41K mutation (data not shown). Depletion of peripheral B cells in E41K-hBtk transgenic mice The B cell populations in bone marrow, peripheral blood, spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes and peritoneal cavity from E41K-hBtk and WT-hBtk mice on the Btk or Btk background were examined by flow cytometry in 6- to 8-week-old mice (Table I; Figures 2 and 3). In contrast, when E41K-hBtk mice on the Btk background were compared with Btk mice, a further depletion of B cells was observed in all lymphoid tissues analyzed (Table I; Figure 2). Also in the mesenteric lymph nodes from the three other independent E41K-hBtk transgenic lines, the proportion of B cells was 15%. Expression of the E41K-hBtk transgene on the Btk background resulted in an analogous reduction in the numbers of circulating B cells, although the effect was less severe than on the Btk background (Table I). The reduction of the proportions of circulating B cells in the E41K-hBtk transgenic mice was accompanied by a relative increase of the percentages of CD4 and CD8 T cells (Table I). In the bone marrow of E41K-hBtk mice, pro-B, pre-B and immature B cells were present in normal proportions, whereas mature recirculating IgM IgD B cells were virtually absent (Table I). Additional analysis of the three pro-B cell subfractions, as defined by expression of surface markers B220, heat-stable antigen (HSA) and BP-1 (Hardy et al., 1991) in E41K-hBtk mice revealed no detectable alterations from the distribution in normal or WT-hBtk mice (data not shown). In strong contrast to the restored IgM/IgD expression profile found on peripheral B cells from WT-hBtk transgenic Btk mice, B cells in spleen, mesenteric lymph node and peritoneal cavity from E41K-hBtk transgenic Btk 5311 G.M.Dingjan et al.

The peripheral blood contained mainly newly-generated B cells that had just left the bone marrow (B220lowIgDlow cells), rather than recirculating cells migrating between follicles (B220highIgDhigh cells: only 17 10% of B cells in E41KhBtk transgenic mice and 71 3% in normal Btk mice). While the spleen of non-transgenic Btk or Btk mice contained ~60% mature B220highHSAlow cells, a small reduction in this population was observed in WT-hBtk transgenic mice and a 3- to 4-fold reduction in E41K-hBtk transgenic mice (Figure 3B). Serum immunoglobulin levels in E41K-hBtk and WT-hBtk mice Serum Ig levels were determined by ELISA in 2-monthold non-transgenic Btk and Btk mice, as well as E41KhBtk and WT-hBtk transgenic mice (Figure 4). In the E41K- Fig. Depletion of peripheral B cells in E41K-hBtk mice.

Data are displayed as dot plots of all gated viable IgM cells from 104 total events (or 3 104 total events for E41K-hBtk transgenic mice on the Btk background). Effects of transgenic WT-hBtk and E41K-hBtk expression on serum Ig levels. Serum concentrations of the indicated Ig subclasses in non-transgenic mice (Btk , n 11; Btk, n 16), as well as WThBtk (n 7) and E41K-hBtk (n 20) transgenic mice on the Btk background, whereby each symbol indicates an individual animal. Except for IgM and IgG2b, the serum Ig concentrations of the E41K-hBtk mice decreased significantly with age. In 6-month-old E41K-hBtk mice, the levels of IgG1, IgG2a, IgG3 were only 37 10, 38 20 and 21 15 g/ml, respectively (n 3). Defective in vivo responses in E41K-hBtk transgenic mice The absence of a dramatic decrease of serum Ig in E41KhBtk transgenic mice at the age of 2 months indicated that despite the observed maturation defect of peripheral B cells, significant numbers of B cells were induced to differentiate into Ig-producing plasma cells. Therefore, we tested the responses of 2-month-old non-transgenic, WT-hBtk and E41K-hBtk transgenic mice on the Btk or Btk backgrounds to TI-II and TD antigenic challenges in vivo. In strong contrast to these limited adverse effects of the WT-hBtk transgene, we found that secondary TD responses were very low or lacking in E41K-hBtk mice, irrespective of their Btk or Btk background (Figure 5C). Because Btkdeficient mice show a normal secondary response to TD antigens (Wicker and Scher, 1986; Kahn et al., 1995; Drabek et al., 1997; Figure 5C), the finding that TD responses are essentially absent in E41K-hBtk transgenic mice was striking. Aberrant in vitro responses of E41K-hBtk transgenic B cells To examine the capacity of B cells to respond to mitogenic signals in vitro, B cell-enriched spleen cell suspensions were stimulated with LPS, anti-CD40 and IL-4, and different concentrations of a goat-antiserum to mouse IgM. Expression of the WT-hBtk transgene completely restored the proliferative capacity, while expression of E41K-hBtk had a minor effect. The defective IgM, IgG1 and IgG3 production in Btk B cells was corrected by transgenic WT-hBtk expression, but the effect of E41K-hBtk expression was moderate for IgM, and negligible for IgG1 and IgG3. Transgenic expression of the E41K mutant did not have a detectable effect on proliferation in response to anti-CD40 and IL-4 (Figure 6B), nor in response to anti-CD40 alone or to anti-CD40 and INF- (data not shown). When the production of IgM, IgG1 and IgG3 in anti-CD40- and IL-4-stimulated cell cultures was evaluated, a marginally lower production was observed in Btk and E41K-hBtk B cells as compared with normal Btk or WT-hBtk B cells. We observed that the absence of proliferative response to anti-IgM antibodies was corrected by transgenic expression of both wild-type and E41K mutated hBtk (Figure 6C). Moreover, when the E41KhBtk transgene was expressed, B cells enlarged more rapidly in response to anti-IgM stimulation (Figure 6D). After 24 h of culture, the E41K-hBtk B220 cells showed a significantly higher proportion of large blast cells when compared with non-transgenic Btk and Btk or WT-hBtk transgenic B220 cells. Increased blast formation of E41K-hBtk transgenic B cells was also Fig. Defective in vivo responses in E41K-hBtk mice. The TI-II antibody response in E41K-hBtk mice was very low but detectable, whether on the Btk or the Btk background. Whereas Btk overexpression in the WThBtk transgenic mice appeared to have a minor inhibitory effect on the levels of TNP-specific IgM and IgG1, the TD primary response was completely absent in E41KhBtk transgenic mice, both on the Btk and on the Btk background (shown for IgM in Figure 5B). TNP-specific IgG2a was decreased in WT-hBtk transgenic mice and TNP-specific IgG3 was low 5314 E41K Btk transgenic mice observed in response to stimulation with 50 g/ml LPS (data not shown). The impairment of TD responses in the E41K-hBtk did not appear to be due to defective induction of MHC class II or the co-stimulatory molecule B7.2 (CD86) on activated B cells, as these activation markers were upregulated after stimulation with goat anti-mouse IgM, LPS, or anti-CD40 and IL-4; culture with anti-CD40 and IL-4 also induced upregulation of CD23 on E41K-hBtk B cells (data not shown). Disrupted splenic architecture in E41K-hBtk mice By immunohistochemical analyses, the spleens of 2-month-old unimmunized Btk , Btk or WT-hBtk transgenic mice demonstrated a characteristic organization, in terms of segregation of T and B cells in the white pulp, with T cells clustered in the periarteriolar lymphocyte sheath (PALS) and surrounded by B cell-rich areas containing follicles, and the presence of marginal zones at the outer boundaries of the white pulp. In contrast, E41KhBtk mice derived from all separate founder lines showed a specific effect of the E41K Btk mutation on the architecture of the spleen. In the E41K-hBtk mice, B220 cells were present in B-cell areas neighboring the T cell zones (Figure 7A, B and C), but B cell numbers were reduced. We observed a dose-dependency of the effect of E41K-hBtk expression on the disruption of splenic architecture, because in line #14, which showed a higher transgene expression level than line #8 (Figure 1B), MOMA-1 cells were essentially absent (Figure 7K and L). Transgenic E41K-hBtk B cells show aberrant responses to mitogenic signals in vitro. (AC) Enriched splenic B cell fractions Btk , Btk, WT-hBtk transgenic and E41K-hBtk transgenic mice were cultured in vitro with various mitogens. (D) Total splenocytes from Btk , Btk, WT-hBtk transgenic Btk and E41K-hBtk transgenic Btk mice were cultured with 1 g/ml goat-anti-mouse IgM for the indicated time points (left), or in the presence of the indicated IgM concentrations for 24 h (right). Disrupted splenic architecture in E41K-hBtk transgenic mice. Immunohistochemical analysis of 5 m splenic frozen sections from Btk mice, WT-hBtk Btk mice and E41K-hBtk transgenic mice [(C), (F), (I) and (K), line #8, and (L), line #14] on the Btk background. The splenic abnormalities of E41K-hBtk transgenic mice on the Btk background were variable, but became more severe with age. In contrast to the Btk mice, Btk and WT-hBtk transgenic Btk mice, the E41K-hBtk transgenic Btk mice did not develop germinal centers, as B220 IgD cells that showed binding of peanut agglutinin (PNA) were completely absent (data not shown). 5316 Analogous to the disruption of splenic architecture, also in mesenteric lymph nodes from E41K-hBtk mice on the Btk background B cell distribution defects were observed. E41K Btk transgenic mice We previously showed that expression of hBtk driven by the class II MHC Ea locus LCR resulted in physiological Btk protein levels in the spleen, which completely corrected the features of the xid phenotype (Drabek et al., 1997). E41K-hBtk represents an activated form of Btk In contrast, expression of the Btk E41K gain-of-function mutation on the Btk background blocked maturation of peripheral B cells, leading to a B cell deficiency that was more severe than the xid phenotype. Although E41K-hBtk transgenic mice produced normal numbers of immature B cells in the bone marrow that began to express IgD, they failed to become mature recirculating follicular B cells in the periphery. The finding that E41K-hBtk transgene expression resulted in a decrease of circulating B cell numbers and a loss of B cell functions, even in the presence of intact endogenous murine Btk, substantiated the dominant nature of the E41K mutation. When expressed in NIH 3T3 cells in vitro, the gain-offunction activity of the E41K Btk mutant was associated with increased membrane localization and was shown to require kinase activity (Li et al., 1995). Our biochemical analyses in unstimulated B cells demonstrated that the E41K mutant had in vitro kinase activity, but did not reveal a dramatic increase in membrane targeting. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that the E41K mutation was associated with relatively small changes in subcellular localization of Btk, which are difficult to detect in biochemical assays. Nevertheless, two of our findings indicated that the E41K mutation represented an activated form of Btk. (i) Expression of E41K enhanced in vitro blast formation of splenic B cells in culture, either with or without mitogens (Figure 6D). (ii) Splenic E41K-hBtk B cells showed proliferation upon stimulation with anti-IgM antibodies (Figure 6C), despite the unusually high proportion of immature B220lowHSAhigh cells in this population. Expression of E41K-hBtk impedes follicular entry and disrupts marginal zone microarchitecture Our findings in the E41K-hBtk transgenic mice indicate that constitutive activation of Btk blocks the development of follicular B cells. Although the possibility that constitutive activation of Btk leads to a general defect that impedes the survival or affects the migration of B cells in the periphery cannot be excluded, it is attractive to hypothesize that expression of the E41K Btk mutant mimics B cell antigen receptor engagement. In the E41K-hBtk mice those cells that were present in the spleen were IgMhighHSAhighB220low immature B cells that have just left the bone marrow. Therefore, the immature status of the E41K-hBtk activated B cells may hamper their subsequent expansion or differentiation and induce their elimination instead. In this context, E41K-hBtk B cells may resemble auto-reactive B cells which have received a stimulatory signal through their antigen receptor, resulting in arrest in the outer PALS where their lifespan is reduced to 34 days in the absence of T cell help (Fulcher and Basten, 1994; Goodnow et al., 1995). The lack of splenic marginal zone B cells in E41KhBtk mice could be a direct result of the impeded follicular entry of B cells, as marginal zone B cells are derived from follicular B cells (Kumararatne and MacLennan, 1981). The B cell abnormalities in E41K-hBtk mice may also hamper the normal development of marginal zone macrophage populations. Further studies will be required to clarify whether the B cell or the macrophage population of the marginal zone is intrinsically affected in E41KhBtk mice, or whether the defects in both populations are secondary to accessory cell dysfunction. Since we have observed a similar disruption of splenic marginal zone architecture in mice that express the E41K-hBtk mutant under the control of the B cell specific CD19 promoter (A.Maas, unpublished results), it seems less probable that macrophage development is intrinsically affected by the expression of the E41K Btk mutant. The absence of any defects in developing B cells in the bone marrow of E41K-hBtk mice (except in the recirculating mature cells) does not imply that constitutive activation of Btk would not have any effect in the bone marrow. Our intracellular flow-cytometric analyses indicate that the expression level of the E41KhBtk transgene may not have reached a critical threshold value in the bone marrow to affect B cell development. We have shown that transgenic expression of the E41K Btk mutant blocks the development of recirculating follicular B cells, indicating that constitutive activation of Btk induces the elimination of virgin peripheral B cells. Materials and methods In vitro mutagenesis The E41K mutation was created by a G to A replacement at position 257 in the hBtk cDNA clone phBtk2.55 in pBlueScript (Drabek et al., 1997). Double-stranded site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was performed with the E41K mutagenic primer 5 -GCACA AACTC TCCTA CTATA AGTAT GACTT TGAAC GTGGG-3 and a 39 bp KpnIBglII selection primer, and the obtained mutant plasmids were sequenced, using standard methods. From the original wild-type hBtk and the E41K mutated cDNA clone, 303 bp PvuINlaIV fragments, encompassing the first two exons and part of exon 3, were used in the construction of the transgenes. Construction of WT-hBtk and E41K-hBtk transgenes The two transgene constructs WT-hBtk and E41K-hBtk are shown in Figure 1A. In a next step two fragments were cloned into this plasmid, using the unique PvuI site in the Ea gene and the unique SwaI site within the polylinker: (1) a 303 bp PvuINlaIV WT or E41K-mutated hBtk cDNA fragment (as described above) and a 97 bp NlaIVSwaI fragment obtained by PCR amplification using primers at positions 46846 and 47029 of the hBtk gene (Oeltjen et al., 1997) and subsequent digestion with NlaIV and SwaI. In the two resulting plasmids with the WT or E41K-mutated first three Btk exons, a 109 bp SalIXhoI fragment containing loxP sequences (obtained by insertion of a loxP oligonucleotide, 5 -ATAAC TTCGT ATAGC ATACA TTATA CGAAG TTAT-3 into the Asp718 site of the pPolyIII vector) was cloned into the XhoI site within the NotISmaIKpnISwaIXhoINotI polylinker. Generation of transgenic mice The WT-hBtk and E41K-hBtk constructs were digested with NotI to release the ~38.2 kb DNA fragments shown in Figure 1. Intracellular flow 5318 E41K Btk transgenic mice cytometric detection of cytoplasmic Btk protein was performed on cells that were first stained for cell surface markers and subsequently fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized using 0.5% saponin. 
11061555	To obtain mutants LTR-RET-MEN2A Y1015F, the LTR-RETMEN2A Y1062F, and LTR-RET-MEN2A Y905F, PCR fragments containing the required mutation were generated by recombinant PCR. To determine the specificity of our antibodies, we prepared mutant versions of EGFr-Ret in which the phosphorylated tyrosines were mutated to phenylalanine (EGFr-Ret-Y1015F and EGFr-Ret-Y1062F). A and B, EGFrRet mutants Y1015F and Y1062F were transfected into COS-7 cells, and protein lysates from EGF-stimulated cells were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. The expression vectors pBabeRET//PTC1, long terminal repeat (LTR)-RET, LTR-RET C634Y (RET-MEN2A), and LTR-RET M918T (RETMEN2B) were described previously (4). Protein lysates (50 g) were obtained from COS-7 cells transfected with LTR-RET (Ret/wt), LTR-RET-MEN2A(C634Y) (2A), LTRRET-MEN2B(M918T) (2B), or pBabeRET/PTC1(H4-RET fusion) (PTC) and from the TT (harboring a RET-MEN2A allele), ARO (negative for RET activation), and TPC-1 (harboring a RET/ PTC1 allele) tumoral cell lines. The TT cell line was established from an aggressive sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma (36) and was previously characterized for the presence of an activating MEN2A-type mutation (C634W) (37). The former harbors a C634W MEN2A-type RET allele (37), and the latter harbors a RET/ PTC1 oncogene (34, 44). Samples 8 (positive for the RFG-RET rearrangement, RET/PTC3), 6 (positive for the H4-RET rearrangement, RET/PTC1), and M2 (containing the Ret C634W MEN2A allele) (46) scored positively at this analysis, showing bands of the expected molecular size, as FIG. To obtain mutants LTR-RET-MEN2A Y1015F, the LTR-RETMEN2A Y1062F, and LTR-RET-MEN2A Y905F, PCR fragments containing the required mutation were generated by recombinant PCR. To determine whether the phosphorylation of the two residues depended on the intrinsic kinase activity of Ret, we transfected COS-7 cells with either EGFr-Ret or a dead kinase mutant (EGFr-Ret-Y905F). Upon EGF treatment, EGFr-Ret-Y905F did not react with either Ab-pY1015 or Ab-pY1062 (Fig. C, A kinase-dead EGFr-Ret mutant (EGFr-Ret Y905F) was transfected into COS-7 cells; protein lysates (25 g) from cells stimulated with EGF (50 ng/ mL) were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Conversely, in more than 95% of patients, MEN2B is caused by the substitution of methionine 918 with a threonine (M918T) (6). The expression vectors pBabeRET//PTC1, long terminal repeat (LTR)-RET, LTR-RET C634Y (RET-MEN2A), and LTR-RET M918T (RETMEN2B) were described previously (4). Protein lysates (50 g) were obtained from COS-7 cells transfected with LTR-RET (Ret/wt), LTR-RET-MEN2A(C634Y) (2A), LTRRET-MEN2B(M918T) (2B), or pBabeRET/PTC1(H4-RET fusion) (PTC) and from the TT (harboring a RET-MEN2A allele), ARO (negative for RET activation), and TPC-1 (harboring a RET/ PTC1 allele) tumoral cell lines.

9819406	Inducible expression of dominant-negative (S17N) Ras completely blocked signal transduction downstream of Ras, including the activation of c-Raf-1 protein and subsequent hyperphosphorylation of MAPK, while it had no effect on IL-3-stimulated cell proliferation of BaF/3 cells (73). Conversely, constitutively active Ras (G12V) prevented apoptotic death caused by IL-3 withdrawal but had only a minor effect on cell proliferation (73). We have made use of the murine hemopoietic cell line BaF/3, which does not express EGFR family members, to express wild-type (WT) EGFR, three kinase-defective EGFR mutants (V741G, Y740F, and K721R), or a C-terminally truncated EGFR (CT957) and have measured their responses to EGF. However, EGF promotes the survival of BaF/3 cells expressing either of the kinase-defective receptors (V741G and Y740F), indicating that these receptors can still transmit a survival signal. Analysis of the early signalling events by the WT, V741G, and Y740F mutant EGF receptors indicated that EGF stimulates comparable levels of Shc phosphorylation, Shc GRB-2 association, and activation of Ras, B-Raf, and Erk-1. Other mutations in the EGFR kinase domain (D813 and V741G) (14, 22), which also abolish EGFR kinase activity, can induce mitogenesis when expressed in fibroblasts. We have shown that mutations in the -helix C of the EGFR (V741G and Y740F) reduce profoundly the tyrosine kinase activity of the isolated receptor in cell-free assays but do not prevent EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation when cells are stimulated with EGF. V741G, Y740F, and K721R each have a single point mutation at the specified residue. V741G is the human homologue of the mouse waved-2 EGFR and transduces a weak mitogenic FIG. V741G and Y740F have negligible kinase activity (22, 45, 77), suggesting that the -helix C in the EGFR kinase domain is important for the activation of the EGFR kinase. However, when BaF/3 cells expressing the V741G or Y740F EGFR are stimulated with EGF, the helix C mutants become phosphorylated on tyrosine residues to levels equivalent to those for the WT receptor (77) (Fig. In contrast, even in the presence of saturating concentrations of EGF, cells expressing V741G, Y740F, and K721R EGFR mutants do not proliferate in response to EGF (Fig. Mitogenic signalling from these EGFR mutants is therefore an all-or-none response and does not correlate with the residual kinase activity as determined in cell-free assays (WT CT957 Y740F V741G K721R [71]) or with the degree of EGF-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptors in intact cells (V741G WT Y740F K721R, CT957 [Fig. In the course of these experiments we noted that despite the absence of proliferation, cultures of cells expressing the kinaseimpaired EGFR mutants V741G and Y740F always contained more viable cells in the presence of EGF than in the control medium. Thus, via a receptormediated process, EGF affords the V741G and Y740F EGFRexpressing BaF/3 cells some protection from the apoptotic death that follows IL-3 deprivation. Parental BaF/3 and K721R EGFR-expressing BaF/3 cells died rapidly in minimal medium and in medium supplemented with EGF; however, the viability of cells expressing the WT, V741G, Y740F, or CT957 EGFR was maintained by EGF (Fig. Closed circles, WT; open circles, Y740F; open squares, V741G. For each cell line the intensity of Shc phosphorylation at 10 nM EGF was taken as maximal, since at this concentration 90% of the receptors are occupied; this is true even for V741G EGFR-expressing BaF/3 cells, which do not have highaffinity EGF binding sites (77). V741G ........................................................................................... The WT EGFR- and V741G EGFR-expressing cell lines exhibited comparable levels of Ras stimulation in response to EGF, whereas stimulation in Y740F EGFR- and CT957 EGFR-expressing cells was only just detectable. At this concentration PD98059 completely abrogated the EGF-dependent survival of V741G and Y740F EGFR-expressing cells but had no effect on EGF-stimulated proliferation of WT and CT957 EGFR-expressing cells (Fig. In our hands, the PI-3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 is effective in blocking growth factor-mediated proliferation and survival, although it is significantly more active on EGF-mediated survival (V741G) than proliferation (WT). These experiments were performed with BaF/3 cells expressing the WT (kinase-active) or the V741G (kinase-inactive) EGFR. 10, the cellular responses to EGF of the WT and V741G EGFRexpressing BaF/3 cells were affected quite differently by inhibitors of cellular kinases. The EGFR kinase inhibitor AG1478 completely abrogates EGF-induced proliferation in WT EGFRexpressing cells but does not significantly affect EGF-dependent survival of V741G EGFR-expressing cells. This result further strengthens the hypothesis that cellular survival in response to EGF in V741G EGFR-expressing cells is mediated by an associated kinase rather than the EGFR kinase itself. The JAK kinase inhibitor AG490 reduces the proliferation of WT cells to "survival-only" levels and has no effect on survival of V741G cells. Inhibition of the Src family of kinases by PP1 has the opposite effect: proliferation of WT EGFR-expressing BaF/3 cells is unaffected by PP1, while survival of V741G EGFR-expressing cells is abolished completely. The inhibitors' effects on the response to IL-3 was identical in WT and V741G EGFR-expressing cells, ruling out the possibility of clonal differences, unrelated to the expression of different EGFR constructs, between these cell lines (Fig. WT EGFR-expressing cells (closed circles) and V741G EGFR-expressing cells (open circles) were cultured as described in the legend to Fig. The numbers of viable cells in the control cultures were as follows: WT EGFR plus EGF, 3.9 105 0.05 105/ml; WT EGFR plus IL-3, 10.4 105 0.6 105/ml; V741G EGFR plus EGF, 1.2 105 0.05 105/ml; V741G EGFR plus IL-3, 10.4 105 0.1 105/ml. Our results with the V741G and Y740F mutant EGFRs demonstrate that in BaF/3 cells the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc in response to EGF is not sufficient to induce mitogenesis. We have made use of the murine hemopoietic cell line BaF/3, which does not express EGFR family members, to express wild-type (WT) EGFR, three kinase-defective EGFR mutants (V741G, Y740F, and K721R), or a C-terminally truncated EGFR (CT957) and have measured their responses to EGF. V741G, Y740F, and K721R each have a single point mutation at the specified residue. In contrast, even in the presence of saturating concentrations of EGF, cells expressing V741G, Y740F, and K721R EGFR mutants do not proliferate in response to EGF (Fig. Mitogenic signalling from these EGFR mutants is therefore an all-or-none response and does not correlate with the residual kinase activity as determined in cell-free assays (WT CT957 Y740F V741G K721R [71]) or with the degree of EGF-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptors in intact cells (V741G WT Y740F K721R, CT957 [Fig. Parental BaF/3 and K721R EGFR-expressing BaF/3 cells died rapidly in minimal medium and in medium supplemented with EGF; however, the viability of cells expressing the WT, V741G, Y740F, or CT957 EGFR was maintained by EGF (Fig. EGF induced strong tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc in cells expressing the WT EGFR, while tyrosine phosphorylation of the Shc proteins in the parental BaF/3 cell line or in cells expressing the K721R EGFR was undetectable. Our results confirm that in the absence of other ErbB family members, the K721R mutant is indeed incapable of phosphorylating Shc, and heterodimerization with a kinase-active EGFR family member is likely to be responsible for Shc phosphorylation in fibroblasts. K721R............................................................................................ We observed an increased association of GTP with the Ras protein in cell lines expressing WT or mutant EGFRs, with the exception of cells expressing the K721R mutant, which consistently exhibited a decrease in Ras-GTP loading when stimulated with EGF. EGF treatment resulted in the activation of B-Raf in all EGFR-expressing BaF/3 cell lines, with the exception of K721R (Fig. Activated MAPK was detected in all cell lines after, but not before, stimulation with EGF, with the exception of cells expressing the K721R EGFR mutant. With the exception of BaF/3 cells expressing the K721R EGFR, EGF can replace IL-3 as a survival stimulus; however, only in cells expressing the kinase-active receptors does EGF stimulate proliferation. We have made use of the murine hemopoietic cell line BaF/3, which does not express EGFR family members, to express wild-type (WT) EGFR, three kinase-defective EGFR mutants (V741G, Y740F, and K721R), or a C-terminally truncated EGFR (CT957) and have measured their responses to EGF. However, EGF promotes the survival of BaF/3 cells expressing either of the kinase-defective receptors (V741G and Y740F), indicating that these receptors can still transmit a survival signal. Analysis of the early signalling events by the WT, V741G, and Y740F mutant EGF receptors indicated that EGF stimulates comparable levels of Shc phosphorylation, Shc GRB-2 association, and activation of Ras, B-Raf, and Erk-1. We have shown that mutations in the -helix C of the EGFR (V741G and Y740F) reduce profoundly the tyrosine kinase activity of the isolated receptor in cell-free assays but do not prevent EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation when cells are stimulated with EGF. V741G, Y740F, and K721R each have a single point mutation at the specified residue. V741G and Y740F have negligible kinase activity (22, 45, 77), suggesting that the -helix C in the EGFR kinase domain is important for the activation of the EGFR kinase. All cell lines express 30,000 to 60,000 EGFR molecules per cell and display low-affinity EGF binding sites (Kd, 1 to 2 nM); however the WT, CT957, and Y740F EGFR-expressing cells also bind EGF with high affinity (Kd, 20 to 50 pM) (77). However, when BaF/3 cells expressing the V741G or Y740F EGFR are stimulated with EGF, the helix C mutants become phosphorylated on tyrosine residues to levels equivalent to those for the WT receptor (77) (Fig. In contrast, even in the presence of saturating concentrations of EGF, cells expressing V741G, Y740F, and K721R EGFR mutants do not proliferate in response to EGF (Fig. Mitogenic signalling from these EGFR mutants is therefore an all-or-none response and does not correlate with the residual kinase activity as determined in cell-free assays (WT CT957 Y740F V741G K721R [71]) or with the degree of EGF-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptors in intact cells (V741G WT Y740F K721R, CT957 [Fig. In the course of these experiments we noted that despite the absence of proliferation, cultures of cells expressing the kinaseimpaired EGFR mutants V741G and Y740F always contained more viable cells in the presence of EGF than in the control medium. Thus, via a receptormediated process, EGF affords the V741G and Y740F EGFRexpressing BaF/3 cells some protection from the apoptotic death that follows IL-3 deprivation. Parental BaF/3 and K721R EGFR-expressing BaF/3 cells died rapidly in minimal medium and in medium supplemented with EGF; however, the viability of cells expressing the WT, V741G, Y740F, or CT957 EGFR was maintained by EGF (Fig. Closed circles, WT; open circles, Y740F; open squares, V741G. Y740F ............................................................................................ The WT EGFR- and V741G EGFR-expressing cell lines exhibited comparable levels of Ras stimulation in response to EGF, whereas stimulation in Y740F EGFR- and CT957 EGFR-expressing cells was only just detectable. At this concentration PD98059 completely abrogated the EGF-dependent survival of V741G and Y740F EGFR-expressing cells but had no effect on EGF-stimulated proliferation of WT and CT957 EGFR-expressing cells (Fig. Our results with the V741G and Y740F mutant EGFRs demonstrate that in BaF/3 cells the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc in response to EGF is not sufficient to induce mitogenesis.

The constitutively active mutant of MEK1 (CA-MEK1) was designed by substitution of the regulatory phosphorylation sites, Ser218 and Ser222, with aspartic acid (S218D/S222D mutant) as described previously (18). To evaluate the role of the MEK1-ERK2 signaling module in epithelial differentiation/ dedifferentiation of MDCK-C7 cells, we performed stable transfections of MDCK-C7 cells utilizing a HA epitope-tagged constitutively active MEK1 mutant (S218D/S222D mutant) (18), FIG.

Moreover, overexpression of a S222E mutant of MEK, which showed enhanced MEK activity as well as stimulation of ERK and p90rsk, increased proliferation and altered morphology of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts but failed to induce their growth in soft agar (21). 
9990072	A normal human c-KIT copy DNA was subcloned into the PCDNAIII mammalian cell expression vector (Invitrogen), and mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis: base 2467 G 3 T, tyrosine (Y) for aspartate at position 816 (D816Y); base 2468 A 3 T, valine for aspartate at position 816 (D816V); bases 2467 G 3 T and 2468 A 3 T, phenylalanine (F) for aspartate at position 816 (D816F); and base 2536 G 3 A, lysine (K) for glutamic (E) acid at position 839 (E839K). A double mutant, D816V E839K, also was made to determine whether E839K is intramolecularly dominant. A double mutant, KITD816V E839K, which incorporates both the activating D816V mutation and E839K loss-offunction mutation, is not phosphorylated spontaneously or in response to exogenous SCF, indicating that the E839K has an intramolecular dominantinactivating effect (lanes 5 and 6). This mutation is dominant in an intramolecular sense because KIT with both E839K and D816V is not spontaneously activated and is nonfunctional. We have reported isolated cases in which an activating mutation, causing substitution of valine (V) for aspartate (D) in codon 816 (V816D), was found in the peripheral blood of adult patients with mastocytosis and hematopoietic disorders (5) as well as in the neoplastic mast cells of a patient with systemic mastocytosis (4) and in a skin lesion of a child with extensive cutaneous involvement and systemic symptoms (6). These 11 adult onset cases all had a transversion in base 2468 (A 3 T) that causes substitution of valine for aspartate (KITV816D) that had been reported in isolated cases (46). The same KITV816D mutation found in sporadic adult cases was found in one pediatric patient who had relatively late onset of adult type macular lesions and progressive disease after 4 years (patient 15).

Adding a codon 816 activating mutation to KITE839K (KITV816D E839K) failed to restore phosphorylation, indicating that the E839K mutation causes a loss of function and is intramolecularly dominant over an activating mutation. The third pediatric patient in this group (patient 14) had several large plaques in additional to smaller discrete lesions and showed novel codon 816 mutations (GA 3 TT in bases 2467 and 2468) resulting in substitution of phenylalanine for aspartate (KITV816F) and constitutive activation of KIT (32).

Sequences of c-KIT from skin lesions and spleen of this patient, sampled as an adult, were heterozygous for a transversion in base 2467 (G 3 T), resulting in substitution of tyrosine for aspartate in codon 816 (KITV816Y). KITV816Y has been detected and studied in vitro and was reported to be highly constitutively activated (23, 28, 32) but has not been demonstrated in vivo.

However, lesions of three children with sporadic cutaneous mastocytosis contained a novel transition in base 2536 (G 3 A), resulting in substitution of lysine for glutamic acid in at position 839 (KITE839K) (Table 3, Group 2a). In contrast, KITE839K, the novel mutation identified in lesions of three sporadic pediatric patients, had unique properties. KITE839K was present predominately as a 125-kDa protein that did not mature into the 145-kDa protein characteristic of both wild-type and mutated KITs (Fig. Furthermore, KITE839K was not phosphorylated spontaneously or in response to exogenous SCF. Adding a codon 816 activating mutation to KITE839K (KITV816D E839K) failed to restore phosphorylation, indicating that the E839K mutation causes a loss of function and is intramolecularly dominant over an activating mutation. Coexpression of KITE839K with KITWT showed that the 839 mutation was dominantnegative in an intermolecular sense (dominant interfering, codominantnegative), suppressing phosphorylation of coexpressed KITWT exposed to exogenous SCF (Fig. The E839K mutant is not phosphorylated spontaneously or in response to SCF (lanes 3 and 4). SCF-induced KITWT phosphorylation (lane 2) is decreased dramatically when the wild-type receptor plasmid is transfected with an equal amount of the E839K mutant plasmid (lanes 5 and 6). Long exposure documents a minor component of 145-kDa KITE839K (lanes 11 and 12). The amounts of 125- and 145-kDa KIT in lanes 13 and 14 equals approximately the sum of these two forms expressed separately (lanes 9 and 10, KITWT; lanes 11 and 12, KITE839K). Blotting of immunoprecipitated KIT with an antiphosphotyrosine antibody (anti-Py, lanes 16) shows a low level of spontaneous KIT tyrosine phosphorylation in COS-7 cells expressing high levels of KITWT (lane 1) but no spontaneous phosphorylation of KITE839K (lane 3). KITWT is phosphorylated in response to exogenous SCF, but KITE839K is not (lanes 2 and 4, respectively). A double mutant, KITD816V E839K, which incorporates both the activating D816V mutation and E839K loss-offunction mutation, is not phosphorylated spontaneously or in response to exogenous SCF, indicating that the E839K has an intramolecular dominantinactivating effect (lanes 5 and 6). Note also that KITWT is present as both a 125-kDa form and as a fully glycosylated, mature, 145-kDa form (lanes 7 and 8) but that KITE839K is present predominately as a lower molecular weight form in the steady state (lanes 9, 10, 11, and 12). This mutation is dominant in an intramolecular sense because KIT with both E839K and D816V is not spontaneously activated and is nonfunctional. E839K is also dominantnegative in a intermolecular (dominantinterfering) sense because it suppresses SCF-induced phosphorylation of coexpressed KITWT. In studies reported separately, we have shown that KITE839K is not glycosylated fully and is retained predominately in the Golgi apparatus (Y.M., X.W., and B.J.L., unpublished work). However, our data indicate that E839K is dominant, and we can say definitively that one pediatric case (patient 16) contains only the E839K mutation because we sequenced the entire c-KIT coding region and found no other mutation. 
12077114	K271R was previously reported as a kinase-inactive mutation. Interestingly, mutation of A380T raised the IC50 for STI571 binding 10-fold over that of wild type Abl kinase. A kinetic analysis of the A380T mutation shows a 2-fold decrease in the Vmax relative to wild type Abl and little change in the ATP affinity (Table II). An alternative explanation for the decreased sensitivity of the A380T mutation is that Ala-380 makes van der Waals interactions with Phe-382, another residue that directly contacts STI571. Thus, the A380T mutation would be predicted to alter the conformation of the ATP binding pocket by disrupting this interaction. Mutations of A380T decreased the sensitivity to STI571 10-fold relative to wild type Abl kinase. While A380T decreased the sensitivity to STI571, A380L was kinase-inactive, suggesting that only a conservative change at that site is tolerated. While A380T decreased the sensitivity to STI571, A380L was kinase-inactive, suggesting that only a conservative change at that site is tolerated. In contrast, both T315V and T315I demonstrated a decreased sensitivity to STI571. 2B), whereas T315I showed no significant inhibition at STI571 concentrations 200-fold higher than the IC50 value of wild type Abl kinase. Mutation of T315V, T315I, and Y253F decreased the sensitivity to STI571. Both the T315V and T315I mutations demonstrate a 2-fold increase in their ATP affinities relative to wild type, suggesting that these mutations may not only eliminate a critical hydrogen bond with STI571 but also increase the affinity of ATP binding relative to STI571, contributing to resistance. The Vmax values of both Thr-315 mutations are lower than the wild type enzyme, with T315V retaining only 28% of its kinase activity and the T315I mutation retaining 61% of its kinase activity. The decrease in kinase activity of the T315I mutation, for example, suggests that in the absence of STI571, the mutation would confer no growth advantage and therefore would not be readily observed in untreated patients. In contrast, both T315V and T315I demonstrated a decreased sensitivity to STI571. The IC50 value of the T315V mutation averaged to 0.30 M, 10-fold higher than that of wild type Abl kinase (Fig. Mutation of T315V, T315I, and Y253F decreased the sensitivity to STI571.

Both the T315V and T315I mutations demonstrate a 2-fold increase in their ATP affinities relative to wild type, suggesting that these mutations may not only eliminate a critical hydrogen bond with STI571 but also increase the affinity of ATP binding relative to STI571, contributing to resistance. The Vmax values of both Thr-315 mutations are lower than the wild type enzyme, with T315V retaining only 28% of its kinase activity and the T315I mutation retaining 61% of its kinase activity. Kinetic parameters of wild type Abl kinase and the T315V mutation. Shown here are representative data for wild type and T315V Abl. [ATP]50% maximum signal values were 80 and 40 nM for wild type and T315V and averaged to 62 and 38 nM, respectively, in four repeats. T315V showed a Vmax of 0.29 in the experiment shown and averaged to 0.28. Mutation of T315V, T315I, and Y253F decreased the sensitivity to STI571. Additionally, the Y253F mutation showed a decreased sensitivity to STI571 with an IC50 value of 1.8 M, 72-fold higher than wild type Abl kinase. The Y253F mutation demonstrated an identical Vmax value to wild type; however, it showed a 2-fold decrease in ATP affinity, suggesting that this residue functions in ATP binding as well as STI571 binding. Additionally, E286L, M290A, and I313G were kinase-inactive suggesting that many sites involved in STI571 binding are also critical for ATP binding and kinase activity. Mutation of E258G decreased the sensitivity to STI571 eight-fold relative to wild type Abl kinase. Interestingly, E258G demonstrated an IC50 value of 0.18 M, 8-fold higher than that of wild type Abl. Additionally, E286L, M290A, and I313G were kinase-inactive suggesting that many sites involved in STI571 binding are also critical for ATP binding and kinase activity. Additionally, E286L, M290A, and I313G were kinase-inactive suggesting that many sites involved in STI571 binding are also critical for ATP binding and kinase activity. Mutation of L370G did not change the sensitivity to STI571. Mutation of L370G did not change the sensitivity to STI571. 
11369651	Activating receptor mutations have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of different forms of cancer, including leukemia.21,22,26,71-74 In the case of AML, although mutations resulting from an internal tandem duplication in the juxtamembrane domain of the Flt3 gene have been reported in a frequency of nearly 20% in AML,71 a recent study has shown that there is also a high frequency of Asp816 mutations of c-kit in AML-M2 with t(8;21) and AML-M4Eo with inv(16): 6 of 15 patients screened had either D816V or D816Y mutation of c-kit.22 The characterization of altered signal transduction pathways and the resulting functional consequences mediated by mutant receptors should provide essential information for the molecular identification of subsets of leukemia and solid tumors as well as the development of nongenotoxic therapies designed to specifically block the function of abnormal receptors and their critical downstream signaling pathways. First, although wild-type c-Kit in the presence of SCF forms dimerized receptors in the extracellular domain, D814Y mutant dimerizes in the cytoplasmic region in the absence of SCF.45 Second, D814V mutant has been shown to possess altered sites of receptor autophosphorylation and shifted specificity for peptide substrates.46 Taken together, our findings and those from others45,46 show that Asp816 mutant c-Kit has certain changes in receptor binding or catalytic properties or both, which selectively activate signal transduction pathways leading to profound phenotypic changes that are distinguishable from the effects of the wildtype receptor.

Wild-type STAT3 and STAT3-C cDNA inserts containing FLAG epitope were also cloned into the pLNCX vector. The cDNAs for dominantnegative STAT3 (Phe substitution at Tyr705, STAT3-YF),32 constitutively activated STAT3 (Cys substitutions at Ala662 and Asn664, STAT3-C),6 and MO7e cells stably transduced with D816H mutant c-kit cDNA were subsequently transfected with pcDNA3.1/Hygro( ) vector containing different STAT cDNAs by electroporation using the Gene Pulser apparatus with capacitance extender plus (Biorad, Hercules, CA). To further investigate the role of STAT3 activation in SCF-independent survival and proliferation in MO7e leukemia cells, a cDNA plasmid encoding constitutively activated STAT3 (STAT3-C)6 was constructed. Functional analysis of STAT3-C shows that it induces cellular transformation in 293 cells, whereas wild-type STAT3 does not (manuscript in preparation), consistent with the original observations that STAT3-C transforms rat and mouse fibroblasts.6 Parental MO7e cells were transduced with the retroviral particles containing the wild-type STAT3 or STAT3-C tagged with the FLAG epitope. Western blot analysis using an anti-FLAG antibody revealed that both wild-type STAT3 and STAT3-C proteins were expressed in the corresponding cell populations (Figure 7A, left panel). However, a greater amount of STAT3-SIE complex, which could be supershifted with anti-FLAG antibody, was observed only in the cytosolic extracts from STAT3-Ctransduced MO7e cells (Figure 7A, right panel). Significant DNA binding activity of STAT3-C was 3564 NING et al BLOOD, 1 JUNE 2001 VOLUME 97, NUMBER 11 Figure 8. (A) Left panel: MO7e cells were transduced with either empty pLNCX vector or vector containing the wild-type STAT3-FLAG or STAT3-CFLAG. (B) MO7e cells transduced with the empty vector, wild-type STAT3, or STAT3-C were cultured in the presence or absence of different concentrations of rhSCF for 24 hours. Although cells transduced with wild-type STAT3 showed a similar percentage of apoptosis compared to cells transduced with the empty vector, significantly less apoptotic cell death was observed in cells transduced with STAT3-C on complete withdrawal of SCF or in the presence of lower SCF concentrations (Figure 7B, left panel). Furthermore, STAT3-C transduced MO7e cells retained long-term viability in culture at a low concentration (1 ng/mL) of SCF, at which both the empty vector and wild-type STAT3-transduced cells were not able to survive (data not shown). Cells transduced with STAT3-C consistently showed more active DNA synthesis than those transduced with the wild-type STAT3 or empty vector in the presence or absence of different concentrations of SCF (Figure 7B, right panel). Activating receptor mutations have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of different forms of cancer, including leukemia.21,22,26,71-74 In the case of AML, although mutations resulting from an internal tandem duplication in the juxtamembrane domain of the Flt3 gene have been reported in a frequency of nearly 20% in AML,71 a recent study has shown that there is also a high frequency of Asp816 mutations of c-kit in AML-M2 with t(8;21) and AML-M4Eo with inv(16): 6 of 15 patients screened had either D816V or D816Y mutation of c-kit.22 The characterization of altered signal transduction pathways and the resulting functional consequences mediated by mutant receptors should provide essential information for the molecular identification of subsets of leukemia and solid tumors as well as the development of nongenotoxic therapies designed to specifically block the function of abnormal receptors and their critical downstream signaling pathways. D814H c-kit, the mouse mutant corresponding to the human D816H c-kit, induces constitutive activation of MAP kinases in a mouse erythroleukemia cell line.18 We examined MAP kinase activation by Western blot analysis using an antibody recognizing phosphorylated ERK-1 and ERK-2 (p44 and p42) in MO7e cells bearing the mutant c-Kit receptor. Another Asp816 mutation of c-kit (D816N) was subsequently identified in childhood AML. G50, a SCF-independent revertant of MO7e cells bearing the D816H c-kit mutation, and MO7e cells transduced with D816H or D816N mutant c-kit were routinely maintained in RPMI media without SCF addition, unless otherwise indicated. DNA sequencing showed that the cloned cDNA encodes a GNNK isoform of c-Kit, which is characterized by the absence of 4 amino acids in the juxtamembrane region of the extracellular domain due to the alternative messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing.28,29 D816H or D816N mutant c-kit plasmids were subsequently constructed by replacement of a 440-bp fragment from the wild-type cDNA with a region containing the corresponding point mutations. The G50 clone (a cytokine-independent revertant from MO7e cells containing the D816H c-kit mutation), MO7e cells transduced with the mutant c-kit cDNAs (kitDH and kitDN) and the AML cells bearing the D816N mutant c-kit were cultured in the absence of SCF. Constitutive DNA binding activity of STAT3 homodimers, STAT3/STAT1 heterodimers, and, to a lesser extent, STAT1 homodimers, was present in the cellular extracts from the G50 revertant cell line and from cells transduced with D816H or D816N mutant c-kit (Figure 1, lanes 3, 13, and 15). Constitutive DNA binding activity of STAT3 and STAT1 was also observed in the AML sample from which the D816N mutation of c-kit was identified (Figure 1, lane 17). However, when cells are transduced with D816H or D816N mutant c-kit, a significant constitutive activation of STAT3 and STAT1 to levels higher than that in SCF-stimulated cells expressing wild-type c-Kit is observed. 2001 by The American Society of Hematology BLOOD, 1 JUNE 2001 VOLUME 97, NUMBER 11 3559 3560 NING et al BLOOD, 1 JUNE 2001 VOLUME 97, NUMBER 11 During the process of investigating genes involved in the inhibition of apoptosis, we have identified a point mutation of c-kit at codon 816 (D816H) (single-letter amino acid codes) from a revertant of the cytokine-dependent human AML cell line, MO7e. G50, a SCF-independent revertant of MO7e cells bearing the D816H c-kit mutation, and MO7e cells transduced with D816H or D816N mutant c-kit were routinely maintained in RPMI media without SCF addition, unless otherwise indicated. DNA sequencing showed that the cloned cDNA encodes a GNNK isoform of c-Kit, which is characterized by the absence of 4 amino acids in the juxtamembrane region of the extracellular domain due to the alternative messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing.28,29 D816H or D816N mutant c-kit plasmids were subsequently constructed by replacement of a 440-bp fragment from the wild-type cDNA with a region containing the corresponding point mutations. The cDNAs for dominantnegative STAT3 (Phe substitution at Tyr705, STAT3-YF),32 constitutively activated STAT3 (Cys substitutions at Ala662 and Asn664, STAT3-C),6 and MO7e cells stably transduced with D816H mutant c-kit cDNA were subsequently transfected with pcDNA3.1/Hygro( ) vector containing different STAT cDNAs by electroporation using the Gene Pulser apparatus with capacitance extender plus (Biorad, Hercules, CA). The G50 clone (a cytokine-independent revertant from MO7e cells containing the D816H c-kit mutation), MO7e cells transduced with the mutant c-kit cDNAs (kitDH and kitDN) and the AML cells bearing the D816N mutant c-kit were cultured in the absence of SCF. Constitutive DNA binding activity of STAT3 homodimers, STAT3/STAT1 heterodimers, and, to a lesser extent, STAT1 homodimers, was present in the cellular extracts from the G50 revertant cell line and from cells transduced with D816H or D816N mutant c-kit (Figure 1, lanes 3, 13, and 15). To determine that the activation of STAT3 was dependent on the expression of Asp816 mutant c-Kit, we transfected both D816H mutant c-kit and STAT3 cDNAs into the human embryonic kidney cell line, 293, which does not express any endogenous c-Kit receptor. Up-regulation of Bcl-xL and c-myc in MO7e cells transduced with D816H mutant c-kit. MO7e cells transduced with empty pLNCX vector or wild-type c-kit were SCF-starved for 5 hours, and then stimulated, together with the cells transduced with D816H mutant c-kit, with rhSCF (40 ng/mL) for the times indicated. cDNAs, thus demonstrating the dependence of STAT3 activation on D816H c-Kit activity. A number of genes that function to protect against apoptosis or promote cell cycle progression, such as Bcl-xL and c-myc, are activated by STAT3.6,37 To determine whether activation of Bcl-xL or c-myc was associated with Asp816 mutant c-Kit, MO7e cells stably transduced with either wild-type or D816H mutant c-kit cDNAs were analyzed. However, a significantly higher level of Bcl-xL expression, which could be further induced by SCF, was observed in MO7e cells transduced with D816H mutant c-kit (Figure 4A). Constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in 239 cells cotransfected with D816H mutant c-kit and STAT3. To determine whether activation of STAT3 or STAT1 is required for the SCF-independent survival and proliferation mediated by Asp816 mutant c-Kit, MO7e cells, stably transduced with D816H mutant c-kit cDNA, were subsequently transfected with plasmids encoding either the dominant-negative STAT3 or STAT1, as well as various control plasmids. Cytokine-independent survival of D816H mutant bearing MO7e cells was evaluated by colony formation assay, in which the cells were cultivated in the absence of SCF in methylcellulose-based medium containing the appropriate antibiotics. Although D816H c-Kitexpressing cells showed similar colony formation when they were transfected with the empty vector, wild-type STAT3 or STAT1 and dominant-negative STAT1, significantly fewer colonies were observed in cells transfected with dominant-negative STAT3 (Figure 5A). Activation of STAT3 and STAT1 by D816H mutant c-Kit was significantly suppressed in cells transfected with the corresponding dominant-negative STAT cDNAs, although there was still considerable DNA binding activity from STAT3/1 heterodimers in dominant-negative STAT3transfected cells (Figure 6A). Significant reduction of Bcl-xL and c-myc was evident only in D816H mutant c-Kitexpressing MO7e cells that were transfected with dominant-negative STAT3 (Figure 6B,C). Down-regulation of Bcl-xL and c-myc by expression of dominantnegative STAT3 in MO7e cells bearing D816H mutant c-Kit. Expression of dominant-negative STAT3 inhibits SCF-independent survival and proliferation mediated by D816H mutant c-Kit in MO7e cells. (A) D816H mutant c-kittransduced MO7e cells were subsequently transfected with the empty pcDNA3.1/Hygro( ) vector, vector containing the wild-type (WT) STAT3 (St3) or STAT1, and vector containing dominant-negative (YF) STAT3 or STAT1. (B) MO7e cells transduced with wild-type or D816H mutant c-kit were incubated in 0.5% FCS in the absence of SCF for 5 hours. D814H c-kit, the mouse mutant corresponding to the human D816H c-kit, induces constitutive activation of MAP kinases in a mouse erythroleukemia cell line.18 We examined MAP kinase activation by Western blot analysis using an antibody recognizing phosphorylated ERK-1 and ERK-2 (p44 and p42) in MO7e cells bearing the mutant c-Kit receptor. However, when cells are transduced with D816H or D816N mutant c-kit, a significant constitutive activation of STAT3 and STAT1 to levels higher than that in SCF-stimulated cells expressing wild-type c-Kit is observed. STAT3 has been implicated in protection from apoptosis51-55 and promotion of cell growth.51,54-58 Constitutive activation of STAT3 occurs in a variety of malignancies, including AML.59-63 Our experiments demonstrate that expression of dominant-negative STAT3 in MO7e cells bearing D816H mutant c-Kit significantly inhibits colony formation in methylcellulose, suggesting that STAT3 activation by mutant c-Kit is required for SCF-independent survival in these cells.

11110708	Mutation of the PLC- binding site in NPM-ALK, Tyr664, resulted in an impaired transforming activity of the NPM-ALK-Y664F mutant.23 However, as implicated in this prior study, the PLC- activity in NPM-ALK transformed cells does not seem to be involved in mediating antiapoptotic responses, which are likely activated separately via other signaling pathways. The NPM-ALK-Y156F-Y418F and -Y664F mutants activate PI 3-kinase Figure 10. Mutation of this tyrosine residue severely impairs the mitogenicity of NPM-ALK.23 We wished to determine whether this Y664F mutant exhibited PI 3-kinase activity in Ba/F3 cells. NPM-ALK-Y156F-Y418F and NPM-ALK-Y664F retain the ability to activate PI 3-kinase. In addition, we constructed 2 other mutants of NPM-ALK, NPM-ALK-Y152F, and NPM-ALKY156F. However, in GST pull-down experiments, both NPM-ALKY152F and -Y156F bound to the p85-CSH2 domain (Figure 8B, right panel).

15310757	A Soluble Form of Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 2 (FGFR2) with S252W Mutation Acts as an Efficient Inhibitor for the Enhanced Osteoblastic Differentiation Caused by FGFR2 Activation in Apert Syndrome* Received for publication, April 30, 2004, and in revised form, August 12, 2004 Published, JBC Papers in Press, August 13, 2004, DOI 10.1074/jbc.M404824200 Yukiho Tanimoto, Masahiko Yokozeki, Kenji Hiura, Kazuya Matsumoto, Hideki Nakanishi, Toshio Matsumoto, Pierre J.

Here we investigated the role of the S252W mutation of FGFR2 on osteoblastic differentiation. Osteoblastic cells derived from digital bone in two Apert patients with the S252W mutation showed more prominent alkaline phosphatase activity, osteocalcin and osteopontin mRNA expression, and mineralized nodule formation compared with the control osteoblastic cells derived from two independent non-syndromic polydactyly patients. Stable clones of the human MG63 osteosarcoma cells (MG63-Ap and MG63-IIIc) overexpressing a splice variant form of FGFR2 with or without the S252W mutation (FGFR2IIIcS252W and FGFR2IIIc) showed a higher RUNX2 mRNA expression than parental MG63 cells. The enhanced osteoblastic marker gene expression and mineralized nodule formation of the MG63-Ap was inhibited by the conditioned medium from the COS-1 cells overexpressing the soluble FGFR2IIIcS252W. Furthermore the FGF2-induced osteogenic response in the mouse calvarial organ culture system was blocked by the soluble FGFR2IIIcS252W. These results show that the S252W mutation in the FGFR2 gene enhances the osteoblast phenotype in human osteoblasts and that a soluble FGFR2 with the S252W mutation controls osteoblast differentiation induced by the S252W mutation through a dominant negative effect on FGFR2 signaling in Apert syndrome. With rare exceptions, Apert syndrome is caused by one of the two missense mutations of the FGFR2 gene involving an amino acid substitution, S252W or P253R, in the linker region between the second and third extracellular Ig domains (4, 9, 10). S252W results from a C755G missense mutation and is more common than P253R caused by C758G in Apert patients (11), and each mutation shows differential effects on the phenotype of syndactyly and cleft palate in this syndrome (12, 13). More specifically, the biological 1 45926 This paper is available on line at http://www.jbc.org Soluble FGFR2S252W Inhibits Osteoblastic Differentiation phenotypes of the digit bone cells derived from Apert syndrome patients are totally unknown. Consistent with the previous genetic and biochemical studies (26, 27), these clinical findings have raised a possibility that the S252W mutation of the FGFR2 may directly cause the unusual differentiation of the digital bone cells. Here we demonstrate that transfection of the gene for human FGFR2IIIc with the S252W mutation (FGFR2IIIcS252W) inhibits the proliferation and reciprocally enhances osteoblastic differentiation of the MG63 human osteosarcoma cell line in vitro. Furthermore the soluble FGFR2IIIcS252W lacking transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains inhibits the osteoblastic phenotype of MG63 cells overexpressing FGFR2IIIcS252W. These results provide direct evidence that activation of FGFR2IIIc caused by the S252W mutation promotes osteoblast phenotype and that a soluble form of FGFR2 with S252W mutation controls osteoblast differentiation. Patients 1 and 2 were male Apert syndrome patients with the germ line mutation of S252W in the FGFR2 gene. Construction of FGFR2IIIc and Soluble FGFR2IIIc Expression Vectors--RT-PCR amplification of FGFR2IIIc and FGFR2IIIcS252W was carried out with a specific oligonucleotide primer pair that contained the start or stop codon of FGFR2 (5 -ATGGTCAGCTGGGGTCGTTTCATCT-3 for upstream, 5 -TCATGTTTTAACACTGCCGTTTATAG-3 for downstream). To remove the stop codon of FGFR2 or gain the soluble FGFR2 lacking the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, the plasmid cDNA for FGFR2 with or without the S252W mutation was amplified by PCR with the specific primer pairs containing the start codon but not the stop codon of FGFR2 and the XbaI/BamHI site (5 -GCTCTAGAATGGTCAGCTGGGGTCGT-3 for upstream, 5 -CGGGATCCAAGCTGTAATCTCCTTTT-3 for downstream) or amplifying the extracellular domain of FGFR2 and with the XbaI/BamHI site (5 -CGTCTAGAATGGTCAGCTGGGGTCGT-3 for upstream, 5 -CGGGATCCGGAAGCTGTAATCTCCTTTT-3 for downstream). The sequence of each expression vector was confirmed by sequencing in both the 5 and 3 orientations by FGFR2-specific primers or vector-specific primers, and these expression vectors were used as constructs encoding the full-length FGFR2IIIc with or without the S252W mutation (FGFR2IIIcS252W-FLAG or FGFR2IIIc-FLAG) and soluble FGFR2IIIc with or without the S252W mutation (sFGFR2IIIcS252W-FLAG or sFGFR2IIIc-FLAG). The COS-1 cells transfected with the FGFR2IIIc-FLAG or FGFR2IIIcS252W-FLAG expression vectors and the culture medium from COS-1 cells transfected with the sFGFR2IIIc-FLAG or sFGFR2IIIcS252W-FLAG expression vectors (IIIc-CM or Ap-CM) were used for further analyses. For the stable transfection, MG63 cells were grown in 100-mm culture dishes at a density of 80% confluence and were transfected with 10 g of FGFR2IIIc-FLAG or FGFR2IIIcS252W-FLAG using SuperFect (Qiagen).

Expression of FGFR2IIIc-FLAG or FGFR2IIIcS252W-FLAG in COS-1 Cells and Their Phosphorylation--It is reported that FGFR2IIIc, a splice variant form of FGFR2, is preferentially expressed in cells of mesenchymal origin such as osteoblasts. To investigate the specific roles of this variant form with or without S252W mutation, cDNAs for FGFR2IIIc and FGFR2IIIcS252W were cloned from ApOB1 by PCR and transiently transfected in COS-1 cells with the 3XFLAG CMV13 expression vector (Fig. In a Western blotting analysis using the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody, two bands corre- 45930 Soluble FGFR2S252W Inhibits Osteoblastic Differentiation FIG.

Effects of Soluble FGFR2IIIc-FLAG (sFGFR2IIIc-FLAG) and Soluble FGFR2IIIcS252W-FLAG (sFGFR2IIIc-FLAG) on FGF2induced Osteogenic Response--It is known that soluble receptors for various cytokines may function as positive or negative regulators for the biological phenomena that are implicated in the physiological and pathological circumstances. To address the question whether or not soluble forms of FGFR2IIIc with or without S252W mutation have a biological function to regulate the phenotype of osteoblastic cells, the expression vectors for the soluble forms of FGFR2IIIc and FGFR2IIIcS252W were constructed and transiently transfected into the COS-1 cells (Fig. Conditioned media were collected from the COS-1 cells transfected with the vectors for sFGFR2IIIc-FLAG and sFGFR2IIIcS252W-FLAG (IIIc-CM and Ap-CM) as well as with the empty vector alone (MOCK-CM).

Administration of 5% Ap-CM containing soluble FGFR2IIIcS252W-FLAG completely inhibited the mineralization of MG63-Ap-C1 4. These data clearly demonstrate that the solu- ble form of FGFR2IIIc with the S252W mutation has a potent inhibitory activity for osteoblastic differentiation of MG63 cells transfected with the FGFR2IIIc gene. DISCUSSION In this study, we investigated the role of FGFR2IIIc with the S252W mutation on osteoblast proliferation and differentiation Soluble FGFR2S252W Inhibits Osteoblastic Differentiation by characterizing the phenotype of the osteoblastic cells derived from syndactylous digit bones of two Apert patients who showed extremely rapid ossification during distraction osteogenesis. Next we identified the phenotype of the MG63 cells transfected with the full-length human FGFR2 gene with the S252W mutation and characterized the biological activities of the soluble form of FGFR2IIIc with the S252W mutation to regulate the phenotypic expression of the osteoblasts. In the light of our new findings, we provide the first evidence that a soluble form of FGFR2IIIc with the S252W mutation acts as a significant and efficient inhibitor of the enhanced osteoblastic proliferation and differentiation caused by the activation of FGF/FGFR2 signaling. Consistently we found that FGFR2IIIc with S252W mutation increased RUNX2 and osteopontin mRNA expression in osteoblastic cells. We generated three stable MG63 clones (MG63-IIIc C1C3) overexpressing FGFR2IIIcFLAG and four stable clones (MG63-Ap C1C4) overexpressing FGFR2IIIcS252W-FLAG. This strongly suggests that FGFR2IIIc, especially the S252W mutant form, plays important roles in osteoblastic differentiation. In contrast, a stimulation of proliferation and apoptosis as well as an inhibition of differentiation was observed following the overexpression of mouse Fgfr2IIIc with S252W mutation in the osteoblastic cell line established from mouse calvaria (32). The reason for the redundancy of the functional roles of FGFR2IIIc with the S252W mutation in the osteoblastic cells still remains unclear, but one possible explanation might be the species difference in the osteoblastic cells or the difference in the cell maturational stages (25). Although FGF/FGFR signaling may cause divergent effects on cell proliferation or differentiation dependent on the cell types or the cell maturational stages (32, 51, 52), we show here that FGFR2IIIc with S252W mutation stimulates osteoblastic differentiation in human cells. A significant growth arrest was observed in the MG63-Ap and MG63-IIIc cells regardless of the FGFR2IIIc expression levels or S252W mutation. Taking these notions into consideration, it is suggested that the loss of p53 function and the activation of FGF/FGFR2IIIc signaling may be strongly implicated in the growth arrest of MG63 cells transfected with FGFR2IIIc or FGFR2IIIcS252W. Therefore, we generated soluble FGFR2IIIcS252W-FLAG and FGFR2IIIc-FLAG lacking transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains as competitive inhibitors for the FGF/FGFR2 interaction. These dominant negative receptors significantly inhibited the FGF2-induced proliferation of MG63 cells, and sFGFR2IIIcS252W-FLAG showed a more potent inhibitory activity on the inhibition than did sFGFR2IIIc-FLAG presumably due to the low dissociation rate of sFGFR2IIIcS252W-FLAG from FGF2 as described previously on the membrane-bound FGFR2 with Apert mutation (15, 16). Although both sFGFR2IIIc-FLAG and sFGFR2IIIcS252W-FLAG induced inhibition of the osteoblastic marker gene expression, only sFGFR2IIIcS252W-FLAG significantly inhibited FGF-2induced osteoblast proliferation and new bone formation in the mouse calvarial organ culture system. Finally sFGFR2IIIcS252W-FLAG almost completely inhibited mineralized nodule formation of MG63-Ap. These results demon- 45934 Soluble FGFR2S252W Inhibits Osteoblastic Differentiation Natl. 158, 441 452 strate that sFGFR2IIIcS252W-FLAG has a wide effective range to abrogate the biological activities of FGF as a dominant negative agent in human and murine osteoblasts. In summary, the present study has proved the biological functions of FGFR2 with the S252W mutation to promote differentiation and to suppress proliferation of human osteoblastic cells, which may be implicated in the establishment of abnormal digit and cranial bone formation in Apert syndrome patients. Furthermore we show that a soluble form of FGFR2IIIc with S252W mutation has a biological function to regulate the phenotype of osteoblastic cells, providing a novel model for the regulation of the abnormal osteoblastic differentiation in Apert syndrome.

With rare exceptions, Apert syndrome is caused by one of the two missense mutations of the FGFR2 gene involving an amino acid substitution, S252W or P253R, in the linker region between the second and third extracellular Ig domains (4, 9, 10). S252W results from a C755G missense mutation and is more common than P253R caused by C758G in Apert patients (11), and each mutation shows differential effects on the phenotype of syndactyly and cleft palate in this syndrome (12, 13). S252W results from a C755G missense mutation and is more common than P253R caused by C758G in Apert patients (11), and each mutation shows differential effects on the phenotype of syndactyly and cleft palate in this syndrome (12, 13). S252W results from a C755G missense mutation and is more common than P253R caused by C758G in Apert patients (11), and each mutation shows differential effects on the phenotype of syndactyly and cleft palate in this syndrome (12, 13). RESULTS The ApOBs Show Highly Differentiated Osteoblastic Phenotype in Vitro--We previously reported a C934G point mutation that elicited an amino acid substitution, S252W, of the FGFR2 gene in Patients 1 and 2 by direct DNA sequence analysis of the genomic DNA prepared from peripheral blood (31). In addition, a 263-bp fragment, which was generated by the destruction of one of the MboI restriction sites due to C934G mutation, was observed in ApOBs (Fig. In ApOBs (middle panel, lanes 3 and 4), a 263-bp band was present due to the C934G mutation. 
12149456	The numbering of amino acids in this paper is according to the type Ia human c-Abl sequence; the mutation P112L corresponds to P131L in the type Ib Abl sequence (8), whereas Y393F and Y226F correspond to Y412F and Y245F, respectively (9). The numbering of amino acids in this paper is according to the type Ia human c-Abl sequence; the mutation P112L corresponds to P131L in the type Ib Abl sequence (8), whereas Y393F and Y226F correspond to Y412F and Y245F, respectively (9). The STI-571 sensitivity of an unphosphorylated Y253F Y393F double mutant is shown in green symbols in F. The Y393F mutation alone did not alter the STI-571 sensitivity of c-Abl significantly (IC50 1.40, blue symbols in F), and the resistance of c-Abl Y393F to STI-571 was not increased by phosphorylation (data not shown). To be certain that the STI-571 resistance of c-Abl Y253F was not caused by residual phosphorylation at Tyr-393, we generated and purified a c-Abl Y253F Y393F double mutant. The Y393F mutation does not alter the basal catalytic activity of c-Abl or its sensitivity to STI-571 (Fig. Importantly, the c-Abl Y253F Y393F double mutant was still resistant to STI-571 (Fig. The numbering of amino acids in this paper is according to the type Ia human c-Abl sequence; the mutation P112L corresponds to P131L in the type Ib Abl sequence (8), whereas Y393F and Y226F correspond to Y412F and Y245F, respectively (9). Mutations of Thr-315 in the Abl kinase domain to Ile (T315I) were previously described in STI-571-resistant patients and likely cause resistance from steric interference with drug binding. Bcr-Abl Y253F demonstrated intermediate resistance to STI-571 in vitro and in vivo when compared with Bcr-Abl T315I. In our previous study (6) we found evidence of amplification of the BCR-ABL gene in three patients, whereas six of nine evaluable patients were found to have point mutations at ABL nucleotide 944, resulting in substitution of isoleucine for threonine at position 315 of c-Abl (T315I). Indeed, the Bcr-Abl T315I mutant is highly resistant to STI-571 in vivo (6) yet retains the ability to transform IL-3-dependent hematopoietic cells to IL-3 independence and induce CML-like disease in mice in a retroviral bone marrow transduction transplantation model (S.R. Bcr-Abl Y253F Has Intermediate Resistance to STI-571 in Vivo and in Vitro, Relative to Bcr-Abl T315I. Based on antiphosphotyrosine immunoblot analysis in transfected 293 cells, Bcr-Abl Y253F clearly was resistant to STI-571 relative to WT Bcr-Abl but nonetheless was inhibited significantly at STI-571 concentrations of 5 M or greater, whereas the previously described Bcr-Abl T315I mutant (6) was absolutely resistant to STI-571 up to concentrations as high as 40 M (Fig. Both the Bcr-Abl Y253F and T315I mutants efficiently transformed IL-3-dependent Ba F3 cells to IL-3 independence (data not shown). Cells expressing the Bcr-Abl T315I mutant were very resistant to STI-571 (IC50 16.88 M). Although decreased proliferation of Bcr-Abl T315I-expressing cells was observed at STI571 concentrations of 30 M and higher, this inhibition probably reflects nonspecific cytotoxicity, because a similar degree of inhibition of parental and WT Bcr-Abl-expressing Ba F3 cells growing in the presence of IL-3 was observed at this dose (Fig. The results confirmed that the in vitro kinase activity of Bcr-Abl Y253F was significantly resistant to STI-571 compared with WT Bcr-Abl (IC50 of 1.31 versus 0.35 M, respectively), whereas the Bcr-Abl T315I mutant was extremely resistant to the drug (IC50 30.1 M). The Bcr-Abl Y253F mutant has intermediate in vivo resistance to STI-571 relative to the T315I mutant. (A) 293 cells transfected with Bcr-Abl WT or the Y253F or T315I mutants were treated for 2 h with increasing doses of STI-571, and cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Abl (Top) and antiphosphotyrosine (Bottom) antibodies. (B) Ba F3 cells expressing Bcr-Abl WT (blue symbols), Bcr-Abl Y253F (red symbols), or Bcr-Abl T315I (orange symbols) were incubated for 24 h in the indicated concentrations of STI-571 in the absence of IL-3, and viable cell number was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyl tetrazolium bromide dye-reduction assay (11). Summary of IC50 values for inhibition of Bcr-Abl and c-Abl by STI-571 IC50 in vitro, M Purified Abl protein Bcr-Abl WT Bcr-Abl Y253F Bcr-Abl T315I c-Abl WT c-Abl P112L c-Abl Y253F c-Abl Y253 393F ND, not determined. In agreement with this model, the Y253F mutation was associated with an intermediate level of resistance to STI-571 in vivo and in vitro, whereas the T315I mutation that seems to interfere sterically with binding of STI-571 caused nearly complete resistance to the drug. The numbering of amino acids in this paper is according to the type Ia human c-Abl sequence; the mutation P112L corresponds to P131L in the type Ib Abl sequence (8), whereas Y393F and Y226F correspond to Y412F and Y245F, respectively (9). The frequency of mutant clones for the three patients with the Y253F mutation was 3 10, 2 10, and 1 6, whereas the two patients with Y253H had 1 10 and 1 7 mutant clones. Mutation of other residues in the Abl nucleotide-binding loop including alterations of Glu-255 to Lys or Val have been reported recently in patients with advanced CML or Ph acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acquired resistance to STI-571 (2426), suggesting that the Abl P-loop may be a frequent target for acquisition of resistance mutations in this population. Bcr-Abl Y253F demonstrated intermediate resistance to STI-571 in vitro and in vivo when compared with Bcr-Abl T315I. In contrast, the Y253F mutation dysregulated c-Abl and conferred intrinsic but not absolute resistance to STI-571 that was independent of Tyr-393 phosphorylation. The Abl P-loop is a second target for mutations that confer resistance to STI-571 in advanced CML, and the Y253F mutation may impair the induced-fit interaction of STI-571 with the Abl catalytic domain rather than sterically blocking binding of the drug. Because clinical resistance induced by the Y253F mutation might be overcome by dose escalation of STI-571, molecular genotyping of STI-571-resistant patients may provide information useful for rational therapeutic management. The frequency of mutant clones for the three patients with the Y253F mutation was 3 10, 2 10, and 1 6, whereas the two patients with Y253H had 1 10 and 1 7 mutant clones. The Y253F mutation was generated in Bcr-Abl and c-Abl by PCR-mediated mutagenesis of a subfragment that was sequenced to confirm the presence of the solitary mutation before subcloning into the corresponding cDNA. Bcr-Abl Y253F Has Intermediate Resistance to STI-571 in Vivo and in Vitro, Relative to Bcr-Abl T315I. Ba F3 cells were plated at 5 103 Tyr-253 to Phe (Y253F) substitution on Bcr-Abl, site-specific mutagenesis was used to introduce the Y253F mutation into p210 Bcr-Abl. Based on antiphosphotyrosine immunoblot analysis in transfected 293 cells, Bcr-Abl Y253F clearly was resistant to STI-571 relative to WT Bcr-Abl but nonetheless was inhibited significantly at STI-571 concentrations of 5 M or greater, whereas the previously described Bcr-Abl T315I mutant (6) was absolutely resistant to STI-571 up to concentrations as high as 40 M (Fig. Both the Bcr-Abl Y253F and T315I mutants efficiently transformed IL-3-dependent Ba F3 cells to IL-3 independence (data not shown). The proliferation of Ba F3 cells expressing WT p210 Bcr-Abl was impaired by STI-571 treatment with 50% inhibition (IC50) achieved at 0.80 M, where cells expressing the Bcr-Abl Y253F mutant exhibited significant resistance to STI-571 with an IC50 of 6.99 M (Fig. The results confirmed that the in vitro kinase activity of Bcr-Abl Y253F was significantly resistant to STI-571 compared with WT Bcr-Abl (IC50 of 1.31 versus 0.35 M, respectively), whereas the Bcr-Abl T315I mutant was extremely resistant to the drug (IC50 30.1 M). The Bcr-Abl Y253F mutant has intermediate in vivo resistance to STI-571 relative to the T315I mutant. (A) 293 cells transfected with Bcr-Abl WT or the Y253F or T315I mutants were treated for 2 h with increasing doses of STI-571, and cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Abl (Top) and antiphosphotyrosine (Bottom) antibodies. (B) Ba F3 cells expressing Bcr-Abl WT (blue symbols), Bcr-Abl Y253F (red symbols), or Bcr-Abl T315I (orange symbols) were incubated for 24 h in the indicated concentrations of STI-571 in the absence of IL-3, and viable cell number was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyl tetrazolium bromide dye-reduction assay (11). Transforming Abl proteins such as Bcr-Abl and c-Abl Y253F exhibit increased tyrosine kinase activity in vivo, raising the possibility that dysregulation of Abl kinase activity by the Y253F mutation might contribute directly to STI-571 resistance. To clarify the relationship between altered regulation of Abl and drug resistance, we compared the STI-571 response of WT murine c-Abl type Ib (myristoylated form) and a c-Abl Y253F mutant with that of c-Abl P112L, which contains a point mutation in the Abl SH3 domain that disrupts binding of SH3 ligands and dysregulates Abl kinase activity in vivo (8) and in vitro (9). 2 B and C), c-Abl Y253F was significantly more resistant to STI-571 than c-Abl WT (IC50 12.42 versus 1.53, respectively). Although Bcr-Abl is dysregulated by the addition of Bcr and perhaps through loss of Abl first exon sequences (19), these results demonstrate that the Y253F mutation induces a similar relative increase in STI-571 resistance in the context of both c-Abl and Bcr-Abl (48-fold, Table 1), although Bcr-Abl seems intrinsically more sensitive to the drug than c-Abl. The STI-571 response of c-Abl P112L in this assay was intermediate between c-Abl WT and Y253F. Ba F3 cells transformed by c-Abl Y253F were significantly more resistant to STI-571 than those expressing c-Abl P112L (IC50 1.52 versus 0.22 M, respectively; Fig. c-Abl P112L-expressing NIH 3T3 cells reverted from transformed to f lat morphology at 0.25 0.5 M STI-571, whereas c-Abl Y253F-expressing cells required 2.55.0 M STI-571 for The Y253F Mutation both Dysregulates c-Abl and Causes Resistance to STI-571. The Y253F mutation was shown previously to activate Table 1. Summary of IC50 values for inhibition of Bcr-Abl and c-Abl by STI-571 IC50 in vitro, M Purified Abl protein Bcr-Abl WT Bcr-Abl Y253F Bcr-Abl T315I c-Abl WT c-Abl P112L c-Abl Y253F c-Abl Y253 393F ND, not determined. The Y253F mutation dysregulates c-Abl and induces resistance to STI-571 in vitro and in vivo. (A) Anti-Abl (Upper) and antiphosphotyrosine (Lower) immunoblots of lysates from parental Ba F3 cells (par) and populations stably overexpressing c-Abl WT, P112L, and Y253F proteins. (D) Ba F3 cells expressing c-Abl P112L (green symbols) or c-Abl Y253F (red symbols) were assessed for their response to STI-571 as described for Fig. (E) Photomicrographs of transformed NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing c-Abl P112L (Upper) and c-Abl Y253F (Lower), incubated 24 h in the indicated concentration of STI-571. Analysis of intracellular phosphotyrosine levels in the two fibroblast populations confirmed that the in vivo kinase activity of c-Abl Y253F was relatively resistant to STI-571 (Fig. Together, these results demonstrate that the Y253F mutation renders c-Abl resistant to STI-571 in vitro and in vivo. Quantitating the kinase activity and STI-571 Y253F mutation, although it activates Abl kinase activity in vivo, does not significantly disrupt the intramolecular regulation of c-Abl as a purified polypeptide. In addition, the presence of both Bcr-Abl and c-Abl in the reaction tends to reduce the apparent resistance of the Y253F mutant. To isolate proteins in their unphosphorylated state, we treated the 293 cells with high doses of STI-571 to prevent autophosphorylation in vivo and removed residual phosphotyrosine from c-Abl Y253F by using T-cell phosphatase. 3B, blue symbols), whereas the activity of c-Abl Y253F was very close to that of c-Abl (Fig. The Y253F mutation does not dysregulate the catalytic activity of c-Abl in vitro. (A) Purified c-Abl WT, P112L, and Y253F proteins have undetectable phosphotyrosine but rapidly autophosphorylate upon incubation in the presence of ATP and magnesium for the indicated reaction (rxn) time (9). (B) MichaelisMenten (Left) and LineweaverBurke (Right) plots of the catalytic activity of c-Abl WT (blue), P112L (green), and Y253F (red) in solution in the peptide kinase assay. The Abl Y253F mutant has intrinsic resistance to STI-571 that is independent of phosphorylation of Tyr-393. (C) Sensitivity of purified unphosphorylated c-Abl WT (blue), P112L (green), and Y253F (red) to STI-571. (DF) Comparison of the STI-571 sensitivity of unphosphorylated (black symbols) and tyrosine-phosphorylated (red symbols) c-Abl WT (D), P112L (E), and Y253F (F). The STI-571 sensitivity of an unphosphorylated Y253F Y393F double mutant is shown in green symbols in F. A modest stimulatory effect of STI-571 on peptide kinase activity of phosphorylated c-Abl and c-Abl Y253F was reproducibly observed at lower drug concentrations. In contrast, the c-Abl Y253F mutant demonstrated significant intrinsic resistance to STI-571 as an unphosphorylated protein, with an IC50 of 8.8 M (Fig. The kinase dysregulation and STI-571 resistance induced in c-Abl by the Y253F mutation therefore seem to be independent of one another. Resistance of Abl Y253F to STI-571 Is Independent of Phosphorylation of the Regulatory Tyr-393. Interestingly, c-Abl Y253F became very resistant (IC50 29.6 M) after phosphorylation (Fig. To be certain that the STI-571 resistance of c-Abl Y253F was not caused by residual phosphorylation at Tyr-393, we generated and purified a c-Abl Y253F Y393F double mutant. Importantly, the c-Abl Y253F Y393F double mutant was still resistant to STI-571 (Fig. Clinical Implications of the Y253F Mutation. The c-Abl Y253F mutant did not exhibit increased catalytic activity in vitro, suggesting that this mutation does not affect the intramolecular binding of SH3 to Pro-223. Therefore, the activation of Abl kinase activity by the Y253F mutation is only manifest when the protein is expressed within a cell. Biochemical and genetic evidence suggests that Abl is additionally regulated in vivo through binding of a cellular protein inhibitor (2123), and the Y253F mutation may interfere with binding of this putative factor. It is possible that Y253F may synergize with Bcr to increase the oncogenicity of Bcr-Abl in vivo by blocking the action of an endogenous protein inhibitor. In support of this notion, the combination of P112L and Y253F mutations in c-Abl increases Abl kinase and transforming activity in vivo relative to either single mutant (data not shown). Similarly, the Bcr-Abl Y253F mutant induced significantly more phosphotyrosine in vivo than WT Bcr-Abl when expressed at similar levels (Fig. In agreement with this model, the Y253F mutation was associated with an intermediate level of resistance to STI-571 in vivo and in vitro, whereas the T315I mutation that seems to interfere sterically with binding of STI-571 caused nearly complete resistance to the drug. Our results demonstrate that at least some P-loop mutants are still sensitive to STI-571 at increased drug concentration, because the Abl Y253F kinase was inhibited significantly by 5 M STI-571, a level that theoretically is achievable in patients based on pharmacokinetic data from the phase I clinical trials. We suggest that clinical resistance to STI-571 induced by the Y253F mutation might be overcome by dose escalation of the drug, and molecular genotyping of STI571-resistant patients could provide information useful for the rational therapeutic management of these patients. The numbering of amino acids in this paper is according to the type Ia human c-Abl sequence; the mutation P112L corresponds to P131L in the type Ib Abl sequence (8), whereas Y393F and Y226F correspond to Y412F and Y245F, respectively (9). The sensitivity of purified c-Abl to STI-571 was increased by a dysregulating mutation (P112L) in the Src homology 3 domain of Abl but decreased by phosphorylation at the regulatory Tyr-393. The numbering of amino acids in this paper is according to the type Ia human c-Abl sequence; the mutation P112L corresponds to P131L in the type Ib Abl sequence (8), whereas Y393F and Y226F correspond to Y412F and Y245F, respectively (9). To clarify the relationship between altered regulation of Abl and drug resistance, we compared the STI-571 response of WT murine c-Abl type Ib (myristoylated form) and a c-Abl Y253F mutant with that of c-Abl P112L, which contains a point mutation in the Abl SH3 domain that disrupts binding of SH3 ligands and dysregulates Abl kinase activity in vivo (8) and in vitro (9). The STI-571 response of c-Abl P112L in this assay was intermediate between c-Abl WT and Y253F. Ba F3 cells transformed by c-Abl Y253F were significantly more resistant to STI-571 than those expressing c-Abl P112L (IC50 1.52 versus 0.22 M, respectively; Fig. c-Abl P112L-expressing NIH 3T3 cells reverted from transformed to f lat morphology at 0.25 0.5 M STI-571, whereas c-Abl Y253F-expressing cells required 2.55.0 M STI-571 for The Y253F Mutation both Dysregulates c-Abl and Causes Resistance to STI-571.

Furthermore, the Gly1057Asp substitution was not associated with age at onset of diabetes in 85 1949 IRS-2 AND TYPE 2 DIABETES TABLE 1 Allele frequencies (number of alleles) of the variants observed in the IRS-2 gene in Chinese and Finnish patients with type 2 diabetes or in the respective control subjects Chinese patients Type 2 diabetic Control subjects patients (n 85) (n 100) 0 ND ND ND 0 ND ND ND 0.300 0.015 (3) 0.005 (1)* 0.005 (1)* 0.005 (1)* 0.005 (1) 0 0.560 (112)* 0.450 (90)* 0.450 (90)* 0.350 (70) Finnish patients Type 2 diabetic Control subjects patients (n 82) (n 85) 0.006 (1) ND ND ND 0 0 ND ND ND 0.305 (50) 0 0* 0* 0* 0 0.006 (1) 0.359 (61)* 0.641 (109)* 0.512 (87)* 0.312 (53) Nucleotide 85 441 465 468 469 1939 2169 2448 2487 3170 Codon 29 147 155 156 157 647 723 816 829 1057 Nucleotide change Insertion AAC CGC3CGG CCC3CCG GCC3GCT GCC3ACC CTG3GTG AGT3AGC TGT3TGC CCC3CCT GGC3GAC Amino acid change Asn83Asn9 -- -- -- Ala3Thr0 Leu3Val -- -- -- Gly3Asp *Determinated in 40 subjects with type 2 diabetes. 0%), and the Gly1057Asp polymorphism (31 vs. The Gly1057Asp polymorphism was not associated with insulin resistance or impaired insulin secretion in Finnish subjects with normal glucose tolerance (n 295) or impaired glucose tolerance (n 38). Only three variants (Leu647Val, Gly897Ser, and Gly1057Asp substitutions) (4,5) have been previously reported in the IRS-2 gene in Caucasian subjects. 0%), and Gly1057Asp polymorphism (31 vs. In both the Finnish and Chinese diabetic patients and control subjects, the Gly1057Asp polymorphism used in the association study was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, thus indicating a representative sampling of subjects. In 295 subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and 38 subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), the Gly1057Asp substitution of the IRS-2 gene was not associated with sex, age, BMI, or glucose or insulin levels at 0, 1, and 2 h in an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (P NS, data not shown). Similarly, in the intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT), the peak insulin level at 4 min did not differ significantly in subjects with and without the Gly1057Asp polymorphism, i.e., the insulin area under the insulin response curve during the first 10 min after the intravenous glucose bolus was GG 2,462 147 (mean SE), GA 2,682 138, and AA 2,756 297 pmol/min (P 0.72) in the NGT group and GG 2,802 400, GA 1,704 236, and AA 2,591 705 pmol/min (P 0.16) in the IGT group; and the insulin sensitivity index was GG 4.3 0.2, GA 4.4 0.2, and AA 3.8 0.4 10 5 (min pmol 1 l 1) (P 0.36) in the NGT group and GG 1.9 0.4, GA 3.1 0.7, and AA 3.0 1.0 10 5 (min pmol 1 l 1) (P 0.23) in the IGT group.

In the 3 half of the IRS-2 gene, which shows a weaker structural similarity with other members of the IRS family (4), we found three common silent variants along with the previously reported Gly1057Asp polymorphism (5) near the 3 end of the IRS-2 gene. A previous study in Caucasian glucose-tolerant subjects (5) showed that homozygous subjects for the Gly1057Asp polymorphism had 25% decreased fasting, 30- and 60-min insulin, and C-peptide concentrations in an OGTT (P 0.01). However, we did not observe any influence of the Gly1057Asp polymorphism on insulin secretion (OGTT and IVGTT) or insulin sensitivity in 295 middle-aged subjects with NGT or in 38 subjects with IGT. Furthermore, separate samples of 295 Finnish subjects with NGT (150 men and 145 women, aged 44 1 years, BMI 25.6 0.2 kg/m2) and 38 Finnish subjects with IGT (15 men and 23 women, aged 51 2 years, BMI 28.4 0.8 kg/m2) from our previous population study (10), diagnosed by an OGTT (75-g glucose) after a 12-h overnight fast (11), were used to investigate the effect of the Gly1057Asp polymorphism on insulin secretion.

Indeed, a defect in the homologous domain of the insulin receptor (I119M) (Fig. 6) appears to disrupt intracellular transport and processing and decrease the abundance of cell-surface insulin receptors. In the first cohort, we identified one girl who was a compound heterozygote for point mutations in exon 2 of the IGF-IR gene that altered the amino acid sequence to Arg108Gln in one allele and Lys115Asn in the other. In the second group, we identified one boy with a nonsense mutation (Arg59stop) that reduced the number of IGF-I receptors on fibroblasts. Analysis of the IGF-IR gene revealed that Patient 2 was heterozygous for the point mutation CGA to discussion TGA (Arg59stop) in exon 2 (see Supplementary Appendix 2, available with the full text of this article We identified two children with biologically sigat www.nejm.org).
