10356061	In our study, we address this issue by comparing the gating defects of two human muscle Na channel mutants (R1448C and R1448P) causing paramyotonia congenita in native muscle specimens from two patients with those of the same mutant recombinant channels expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells. Keywords: Na channel; For R1448P channels, inactivation was almost six-fold and for R1448C it was three-fold slower than for wildtype channels. Recently, we applied the patch-clamp technique to blebs of muscle fibres from a paramyotonia congenita patient carrying the arginine-1448-proline (R1448P) mutation within Oxford University Press 1999 the voltage sensor IV/S4 of the -subunit of the human skeletal muscle Na channel (Lerche et al., 1996). Here, we provide a detailed analysis of the R1448P mutation, which has not been expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells before and we compare two mutations causing paramyotonia congenita (R1448C and R1448P) in both expression systems--native muscle of paramyotonia congenita patients and HEK-293 cells. Whole-cell recordings of Na currents through R1448P channels in HEK-293 cells The R1448P mutation results in the substitution of a neutral proline for a positively charged arginine in the S4 segment of domain IV of the Na channel -subunit, which is composed of four highly homologous domains containing six transmembrane segments each (for review, see Catterall, 1995). Families of Na currents for wild-type and R1448P channels are shown in Fig. With respect to wild type, for R1448P the faster time constant h1 (relative weight 75%) was almost sixfold larger at a test potential of 0 mV (Fig. It was increased 1.5-fold in R1448P channels compared with wild-type channels (Fig. For R1448P channels, the steady-state activation curve describing the voltage dependence of channel opening was shifted by 8 mV (Fig. 1 Gating of R1448P Na channels expressed in HEK cells. (A, B) Current traces from whole-cell recordings of wild-type (WT) and R1448P mutant Na channels. Lines represent fits to standard Boltzmann functions (I/IMAX 1/[1 exp([V V0.5]/k)]) with the following parameters (wild type versus R1448P in mV): activation: V0.5 16 1 versus 24 1 (P 0.001), slope k 5.9 0.3 versus 7.1 0.3 (P 0.01), n 810; inactivation: V0.5 61 1 versus 68 2 (P 0.05), k 6.6 0.2 versus 13.6 0.5 (P 0.0001), n 89. Values of rec1 in ms for wild type versus R1448P at 60 and 100 mV: 22.1 1.2 versus 6.7 0.6 (P 0.0001), 2.7 0.2 versus 1.5 0.2 (P 0.01). influence of the slowed inactivation on our procedure for determining the activation curve: all currents were normalized to the largest peak current, which was delayed in R1448P. Recovery from inactivation was significantly accelerated and its voltage dependence decreased for R1448P (Fig. For some mutations causing potassium-aggravated myotonia (Mitrovic et al., 1995) but also for the R1448P mutation (Featherstone et al., 1998), it has been proposed that slowed deactivation increases the Na inward current and may therefore contribute to membrane depolarization and myotonia. 1F), suggesting normal deactivation for R1448P. In summary, R1448P affects inactivation and recovery from inactivation with minor effects on activation. We would like to summarize the most important gating differences from wild-type and R1448P channels found in our study, which is important in the light of the comparison of native channels with those expressed in HEK cells, since these experiments were performed with both the R1448P and the R1448C mutation. R1448C channels were expressed, measured and analysed in the same way as described above for wild-type and R1448P channels. The fast inactivation time constant, h1, was 1.46 0.08 ms at 0 mV, thus only threefold higher than that for the wild type, whereas R1448P channels showed a 5.8-fold increase in h1. shift of steady-state inactivation was more pronounced for R1448C than for R1448P channels (V0.5 79 2 mV for R1448C), while the steepness was not decreased as much for R1448C (k 11.4 0.3 mV). First latencies were similar (0.6 0.1 versus 0.7 0.1 ms in wild type, n 34) and mean open times were slightly prolonged for R1448P compared with wild-type channels. The respective time constants for R1448P and wild type were 1 0.26 0.02 and 0.19 0.01 ms (P 0 .01), 2 0.97 0.06 and 0.83 0.10 ms (P 0.05); 0 3 and 25 4% (P relative weights of 2 were 50 .001) (n 813). Normalized late Na currents calculated from reopenings were significantly increased in R1448P (Fig. Slower current decay and increased persistent current were seen over the whole temperature range for R1448P channels (Fig. The value of Ea was not increased for R1448P channels (Fig. The ISS/IPEAK was significantly increased for R1448P at all temperatures investigated (at 22C, 0.19 0.03 versus 1.11 0.12%, n 1314, P 0.001). Paramyotonia congenita-causing mutations result predominantly in a slowing of fast inactivation (Chahine et al., 1994; Yang et al., 1994; Hayward et al., 1996), which is most pronounced in R1448P. Fast inactivation time constants, h1, for Na currents recorded from a control and a paramyotonia congenita muscle from a patient carrying the R1448P mutation (A) and from wild-type (WT) and R1448P channels expressed in HEK-293 cells (B). The value of h1 in HEK cells was increased 5.8-fold for R1448P compared with wild type (at 0 mV, 2.77 0.11 versus 0.48 0.01 ms, n 1016, P 0.0001). to calculate the percentage of mutant channels in muscle from patients carrying the R1448P or R1448C mutations, we analysed and compared the decay of the Na currents in HEK cells and in muscle. channels in muscle from a Previously, we compared Na paramyotonia congenita patient carrying the R1448P mutation and from normal controls by fitting the current decay to a second-order exponential function (Lerche et al., 1996; Fig. In contrast, in HEK cells the most pronounced difference was a 5.8-fold increase in h1 for R1448P compared with wild-type channels (Fig. For the R1448P mutation, the drastic difference in h1 ensured a good separation of wild-type and mutant fast inactivation time constants in the paramyotonia congenita muscle specimen. Altogether, we think that our method reliably estimated the percentage of mutant channels in paramyotonia congenita muscle containing the R1448P mutation due to the large difference in h1, which enabled a clear separation of mutant and wild-type channels. The decay of Na currents recorded in muscle from two paramyotonia congenita patients carrying either the R1448P or the R1448C mutation was fitted to a thirdorder exponential function: I(t)/IPEAK AWT exp(t/h1WT) AMT exp(t/h1MT) A2 exp(t/h2) ISS/IPEAK, where AWT and h1WT represent the relative amplitude and fast inactivation time constant of wild type channels, respectively, AMT and h1MT the relative amplitude and fast inactivation time constant of the mutant channels, A2 and h2 the slow component of fast inactivation of both wild-type and mutant channels, and ISS/IPEAK the relative persistent current. With these settings, h1MT for R1448P channels was 2.25 0.17 ms with a relative amplitude A1MT/(A1WT A1MT) of 38 5% (n 5). When we repeated the fit using the fixed value of h1MT 2.77 ms obtained from R1448P channels expressed in HEK cells, the result was similar (35 3% mutant channels). The relative proportion of R1448C channels A1MT/(A1WT A1MT) was determined to be even smaller than for R1448P (only 19.5 1.6%), with a time constant for the mutant channels of 1.71 10.18 ms (n 5). Using this third-order exponential fit, the third time constant was similar for control and both paramyotonia congenita muscles, and generally had a small amplitude [h2, 12.4 2.7 (wild type) versus 11.3 1.8 (R1448P) and 12.0 1.8 (R1448C) ms; A2, 6.3 1.7 versus 6.3 4.0 and 3.0 1.3%]. The phenotype of our patient carrying the R1448P mutation is severe (Wang et al., 1995; Lerche et al., 1996), while the phenotype of the other patient is moderate [kinship Q, patient V/26 in Becker (Becker, 1970); Haass et al., 1981]. The myotonic features were much more pronounced for the patient carrying the R1448P mutation. Although the R1448C patient experiences less severe myotonic symptoms, he suffers from episodes of weakness in a warm environment, similar to patients with hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis, which has not been reported for the R1448P patient. This is in accordance with our hypothesis that weakness is favoured by a hyperpolarizing shift of the steady-state inactivation curve (Lerche et al., 1996; Wagner et al., 1997), which is clearly more pronounced for R1448C than for R1448P channels. Paramyotonia congenita: the R1448P Na channel mutation in adult human skeletal muscle. In our study, we address this issue by comparing the gating defects of two human muscle Na channel mutants (R1448C and R1448P) causing paramyotonia congenita in native muscle specimens from two patients with those of the same mutant recombinant channels expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells. Keywords: Na channel; For R1448P channels, inactivation was almost six-fold and for R1448C it was three-fold slower than for wildtype channels. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of the R1448P mutation, which has not been expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells before and we compare two mutations causing paramyotonia congenita (R1448C and R1448P) in both expression systems--native muscle of paramyotonia congenita patients and HEK-293 cells. The electrophysiological phenotype of R1448C channels has been described in detail before (Chahine et al., 1994). We would like to summarize the most important gating differences from wild-type and R1448P channels found in our study, which is important in the light of the comparison of native channels with those expressed in HEK cells, since these experiments were performed with both the R1448P and the R1448C mutation. R1448C channels were expressed, measured and analysed in the same way as described above for wild-type and R1448P channels. shift of steady-state inactivation was more pronounced for R1448C than for R1448P channels (V0.5 79 2 mV for R1448C), while the steepness was not decreased as much for R1448C (k 11.4 0.3 mV). Steady-state activation was slightly shifted towards more negative potentials, and recovery from inactivation was accelerated for R1448C compared with wild type, as has been described previously (Chahine et al., 1994). to calculate the percentage of mutant channels in muscle from patients carrying the R1448P or R1448C mutations, we analysed and compared the decay of the Na currents in HEK cells and in muscle. For the R1448C mutation, the result of 20% mutant channels is less reliable because of the smaller inactivation defect (only 3-fold increase in h1), hence the difficulty in clearly separating the time constants from wild-type and mutant channels. The steady-state inactivation curve for the R1448C mutation measured in HEK cells was shifted by 18 mV compared with 6 ild type (V0.5 w 61.5 1.2 and 79.2 2.4 mV; k .1 0.1 and 11.4 0.3 mV; n 8), and in the paramyotonia congenita muscle containing this mutation this shift was 11.5 mV (V0.5 8 93.7 0.4 and 105.2 2.2 mV; k .4 0.3 and 9.3 0.3 mV; n 512). Since slow inactivation was not significantly different for wild-type and R1448C channels (N. The 20% share calculated for R1448C channels could be an underestimate since the difference in h1 was only threefold. The decay of Na currents recorded in muscle from two paramyotonia congenita patients carrying either the R1448P or the R1448C mutation was fitted to a thirdorder exponential function: I(t)/IPEAK AWT exp(t/h1WT) AMT exp(t/h1MT) A2 exp(t/h2) ISS/IPEAK, where AWT and h1WT represent the relative amplitude and fast inactivation time constant of wild type channels, respectively, AMT and h1MT the relative amplitude and fast inactivation time constant of the mutant channels, A2 and h2 the slow component of fast inactivation of both wild-type and mutant channels, and ISS/IPEAK the relative persistent current. For a different biopsied muscle specimen from a patient with a moderate form of paramyotonia congenita carrying the R1448C mutation (Becker, 1970), we analysed the current decay using the same fitting procedure as described above. The relative proportion of R1448C channels A1MT/(A1WT A1MT) was determined to be even smaller than for R1448P (only 19.5 1.6%), with a time constant for the mutant channels of 1.71 10.18 ms (n 5). Using this third-order exponential fit, the third time constant was similar for control and both paramyotonia congenita muscles, and generally had a small amplitude [h2, 12.4 2.7 (wild type) versus 11.3 1.8 (R1448P) and 12.0 1.8 (R1448C) ms; A2, 6.3 1.7 versus 6.3 4.0 and 3.0 1.3%]. In the case of the patient carrying the R1448C mutation, the less severe myotonic phenotype could be explained by both the smaller inactivation defect and a reduced number of mutant channels. However, we would like to mention that the R1448C mutation may also cause a severe phenotype in other patients. Although the R1448C patient experiences less severe myotonic symptoms, he suffers from episodes of weakness in a warm environment, similar to patients with hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis, which has not been reported for the R1448P patient. This is in accordance with our hypothesis that weakness is favoured by a hyperpolarizing shift of the steady-state inactivation curve (Lerche et al., 1996; Wagner et al., 1997), which is clearly more pronounced for R1448C than for R1448P channels.

Another source of genetic variation, responsible for mild cystic fibrosis (CF) and/or congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens, is the mutation R117H, located in exon 4 of CFTR. The severity of the CF phenotype is partly dependent on the IVS8 background on which R117H occurs; thus, it is important to be able to test clinically for both these variants. Key words: cystic fibrosis, R117H, IVS8-5T, restriction digestion. This variation has been shown to modify the severity of the CF phenotype; for example, the IVS8-5T allele can produce a mild CF phenotype when combined in cis with certain other CF mutations, in particular, the R117H mutation in exon 4 [4]. R117H on the IVS8-7T background (R117H-IVS8-7T) has been found at From Clinical Pathology, State University of New York Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY. R117H on the IVS8-5T background has been found in individuals with pancreatic-sufficient CF. It is thus clinically relevant to test the number of thymines at this site, particularly in patients with R117H as a predictor of phenotype.

Discussion The R117H CF mutation accounts for nearly 1% of CF alleles in whites [7] and usually results in relatively mild CF with pancreatic sufficiency and only slightly elevated sweat chloride levels. The R117H-IVS8-5T allele is much less common than the R117H-IVS8-7T allele in the general public but far more common among patients with CF. A Kaiser Permanente study found R117H was 19-fold more common in the general population than predicted from its frequency in patients with CF [8]. All 16 R117H carriers identified by population screening had the R117H-IVS8-7T allele. Compound heterozygotes with one copy of the common CF mutation, delta F508, and one copy of R117H (R117H-IVS8-5T ) are associated with pancreaticsufficient CF [2,3], whereas R117H-IVS8-7T can be asymptomatic with respect to CF but results in CBAVD or, rarely, in pancreatic-sufficient CF [14]. The most likely explanation is that R117HIVS8-5T is more severe than R117H-IVS8-7T. Because delta F508 is found exclusively on the IVS8-9T background [1,3], the R117H-IVS8-polythymidine background can usually be determined in patients with CF even in the absence of parental samples. There is a report of a single case of R117H in cis with IVS8-9T reported in a black boy with borderline to mildly elevated sweat chloride levels [9]. Many laboratories do not test for R117H or intron 8 polythymidine variants because no naturally occurring restriction site is altered by these mutations. Determination of the R117H-intron 8 polythymidine haplotype is required to provide the most accurate risk estimate for CF phenotype to provide accurate genetic counseling [10]. The method described here should increase the number of clinical laboratories providing testing for IVS8-5T and R117H.

These mutations, leucine to phenylalanine L1014F (knockdown resistance, kdr) and methionine to threonine M918T (super-kdr), have subsequently been identified in M. The M918T mutation has only been found in insects already possessing L1014F and significantly enhances resistance conferred by the latter (Williamson et al., 1996; Vais et al., 2000; Jamroz et al., 1998). In this paper, we describe two assays, a simple low cost screen for the kdr and super-kdr phenotypes and a highthroughput allelic discrimination assay, for L1014F and M918T, that can be run in conjunction with MACE and carboxylesterase tests developed previously, and applied to the same individual aphids.

A comparison between those samples heterozygous for L1014F (kdr) and homozygous for M918 (SRSS), and the samples homozygous for L1014 and M918 (SSSS) indicated survivorship was not significantly different (p 0:083) and were therefore grouped in subsequent tests.

All of these mutants (Y1586R, n 5; Y1586A, n 6; Y1586D, n 4) had right-shifted activation (conductancevoltage) curves (p 0.001 versus 1), although the slopes of the curves were not statistically different from that of 1 (Y1586R: 14.3 6.7 mV, k 8.8 4.5 mV; Y1586A: 0 22.5 1.6 mV, k 10.8 1.5 mV; Y1586D: 18.4 .5 mV, k 9.7 0.5 mV). 1); Y1586A, 84.0 0.1 mV (N.S.); Y1586D, 81.6 0.2 mV (N.S.).

Substitution of an amino acid with no charge (alanine, A) in the mutant Y1586A or with a negative charge (aspartic acid, D) in Y1586D produces time constants of recovery from short depolarization more similar to that of 1 than to that of Y1586K (Table 1). Inactivation in the mutants Y1586A (n 3) and Y1586D (n 4) is similar to that in 1. Support for the role of a positive charge in atypical inactivation also comes from the distinction in steady-state atypical inactivation (a ) between the mutants Y1586D (negatively charged) and Y1586A (uncharged) and the positively charged mutants Y1586K and Y1586R (Fig. T 1 he a curve for Y1586R (V1/2 99.9 0.3 mV, k 0.9 0.2; n 5) resembles Y1586K, while the other mutants are similar to 1 (Y1586A: V1/2 41.5 1.5 mV, k 10.9 1.4, n 5; Y1586D: V1/2 55.3 0.9 mV, k 12.5 0.8, n 6; Fig. Substitution of an amino acid (alanine, A) with no charge in the mutant Y1586A or with a negative charge (aspartic acid, D) in Y1586D produces slow inactivation phenotypes more similar to those of 1 (Fig. The s values for the mutants Y1586A and Atypical Inactivation in Na C hannels 779 FIGURE 4 Atypical inactivation in Y1586K is voltage dependent.

In Y1586K, macroscopic current decay is faster, the V1/2 of the activation curve is shifted in the depolarized direction, and the fast-inactivation curve is less steep compared with 1. After an 8-ms depolarization pulse, Y1586K recovers from inactivation much more slowly than 1. Varying the depolarization protocols isolates entry into an additional, "atypical" inactivation state in Y1586K that is distinct from typical fast or slow inactivation. Substitution of positively charged arginine (R) at Y1586 produces an inactivation phenotype similar to that of Y1586K. Our results suggest that the positive charge of lysine (K) produces the atypical inactivation state in Y1586K. We propose that a conformational change during depolarization alters the relative position of the 1586K residue in the D4-S6 segment and that atypical inactivation in Y1586K occurs via an electrostatic interaction in or near the inner pore region. In this study we have characterized a rat skeletal muscle NaCh mutant (Y1586K) that has a single amino acid substitution, lysine (K) for tyrosine (Y), at position 1586 in D4-S6 (Fig. We used patch-clamp techniques on transiently transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells to compare the activation and inactivation kinetics of Y1586K and wild-type rat skeletal muscle NaCh ( 1). Although 1 and Y1586K differ somewhat in activation and fast inactivation, the most striking difference is that Y1586K recovers from a relatively short depolarization (8 ms) much more slowly and with a different time course than 1. phenotype of Y1586K. We propose that a molecular conformational change during depolarization alters the relative position of the D4-S6 segment in Y1586K. We hypothesize that atypical inactivation in Y1586K results from an electrostatic interaction of the 1586K residue (e.g., with negatively charged residues) in or near the inner pore region. Electrophysiology protocols ference in recovery phenotype between Y1586K and 1 is due to the presence of an additional, "atypical" inactivation state in Y1586K that is kinetically intermediate and distinct from typical fast and slow inactivation. RESULTS Na channel mutant Y1586K exhibits some differences from wild-type 1 in activation and fast inactivation kinetics Whole-cell Na current was recorded from HEK cells transiently transfected with the -subunit of wild-type 1 or Y1586K (Fig. Fast inactivation (macroscopic current decay from a test pulse to 50 mV fit with a single exponential) is faster in Y1586K (0.24 0.01 ms; n 21) than in wild-type 1 (0.29 0.01 ms; n 21; p 0.001). The h curve for steady-state fast inactivation (100-ms conditioning pulse) is less steep for Y1586K (k 8.1 0.2 mV; n 10) than for wild-type 1 (k 5.7 0.1 mV; n 1 2; p 0.001), although the V1/2 of the curves are similar ( 79.9 0.1 mV for Y1586K; 81.5 0.1 mV for 1; Fig. The activation (conductance-voltage) curve is right-shifted in Y1586K ( 21.1 1.4 mV) compared with wild-type 1 ( 29.8 0.8 mV; p 0.01; Fig. The inactivation Short depolarizations reveal an "atypical" inactivation state in Y1586K By 2 ms of depolarization to 50 mV, 1 and Y1586K close and fast inactivate (see Fig. When the membrane is repolarized to 140 mV after a 2-ms depolarization pulse to 50 mV, recovery from the fast inactivation state to the available (closed/resting) state is monoexponential and rapid in 1 and Y1586K (Fig. After a longer depolarization (8 ms), recovery differs between 1 and Y1586K. While 1 recovers monoexponentially and rapidly (by 50 ms) after an 8-ms depolarization, recovery for Y1586K is 10-fold slower (by 500 ms) than 1 and follows a double-exponential time course (Fig. FIGURE 2 Compared to wild-type 1, the steady-state fast inactivation curve is less steep in Y1586K and the activation curve is shifted in the positive direction. (A) Inactivation curves for wild-type 1 (n 12) and Y1586K (n 10). (B) Activation (conductance-voltage) curves for 1 (n 12) and Y1586K (n 10). Depolarization to 50 mV for 100 ms also demonstrates an exaggerated difference between 1 and Y1586K (Fig. In contrast, Y1586K recovers mostly from the atypical inactivated state with a single-exponential time constant of 110.3 3.6 ms (Table 1). In response to depolarization to 0 mV for various times from 2 ms to 1 s, Y1586K (n 5) inactivates with a time constant of 20 ms. After 100 ms at 0 mV, Y1586K is 60% inactivated, while 1 (n 4) shows little inactivation. Longer depolarizations begin to induce significant slow inactivation in 1 and Y1586K (e.g., see Fig. Inactivation in Y1586K (V1/2 1 01.2 0.9 mV, k 9.9 0.8; n 10) is greater at all voltages compared to 1 (V1/2 1 44.9 0.5 mV, k 0.1 0.4; n 5). The theoretical midpoint for atypical inactivation from this fit is 97.9 mV for Y1586K, which agrees reasonably well with the experimentally determined midpoint of 101.2 mV. The inactivation between 120 mV and 70 mV in Y1586K is due mostly to atypical inactivation, whereas inactivation at greater depolarizations probably reflects some entry into slow inactivation. Atypical inactivation in Y1586K is kinetically distinct from typical fast and slow inactivation Slow inactivation can be kinetically isolated from fast inactivation in 1 with the use of a double-pulse protocol. 3 A), initial experiments comparing 1 and Y1586K used a 50-ms interpulse hyperpolarization to 140 mV to allow recovery from fast inactivation. Atypical Inactivation in Na C hannels 777 FIGURE 3 Recovery from short depolarizations is slower in Y1586K than in 1. Data (exponential fits of means SEM) in A, B, and C are from the same cells expressing either Y1586K (n 5) or 1 (n 3). (B) Recovery from an 8-ms depolarization in 1 is fast and follows a single exponential, while recovery in Y1586K is slow and follows a double exponential, suggesting recovery from two inactivation states, fast and "atypical." (C) Recovery from 100-ms depolarization is slow in Y1586K and is mostly from the atypical inactivation state, while 1 recovers mostly from fast inactivation. (D) Short depolarizations produce inactivation in Y1586K (n 5) but little to no inactivation in 1 (n 4). 5 A shows that Y1586K inactivates much more rapidly than 1 when a 50-ms interpulse is used in the slow inactivation protocol. The data for Y1586K can be fit with a three-exponential function (Table 2). Further support for the presence of an atypical inactivation state in Y1586K comes from additional experiments using a different interpulse interval. 3 C suggest that recovery in Y1586K from the atypical inactivation state takes 500 ms. Therefore, we used a 500-ms interpulse interval in the slow inactivation protocol for Y1586K to allow recovery from the atypical inactivated state. When Y1586K (n 10) is allowed to recover for 500 ms at 140 mV, the protocol produces a Y1586K slow inactivation profile similar to that of 1 (Fig. These results suggest that development of typical slow Biophysical Journal 78(2) 773784 778 TABLE 1 Recovery from short depolarizations for wild-type 1 and NaCh mutants Recovery from short depolarization to 50 mV: time constants (ms); component (%) Channel [n] Wild-type 1 [3] Y1586K [5] Y1586R [3] Y1586A [4] Y1586D [5] 2-ms pulse 1.1 1.3 1.9 1.2 1.0 0.02 0.06 0.1 0.02 0.03 8-ms pulse 1.4 1.4 65.7 2.6 37.1 1.7 1.2 0.07 0.1 (67) 6.7 (34) 0.4 (71) 7.9 (29) 0.07 0.05 100-ms pulse 1.7 110.3 57.5 1.6 1.4 0.08 3.6 7.9 0.09 0.07 O'Reilly et al. inactivation is functionally similar in Y1586K and 1 and that the difference in inactivation phenotype between 1 and Y1586K with the 50-ms interpulse is due to the presence of an atypical inactivation state in Y1586K that is distinct from typical fast and slow inactivation. Steady-state and recovery from slow inactivation differ between Y1586K and 1 Y1586K shows a dramatic negative shift ( 113.9 0.1 mV) in the steady-state (s ) slow inactivation curve (50-ms interpulse) compared with 1 ( 74.2 1.1 mV; Fig. In addition, recovery from slow inactivation is slower in Y1586K than in 1 (Fig. Recovery from short depolarizations (2, 8, or 100 ms) in the mutant Y1586R, which carries a positive charge (as does lysine, K), is similar to that in Y1586K. The recovery profile of Y1586R from an 8-ms depolarization includes a component comparable to the atypical inactivation observed in Y1586K (Table 1). Substitution of an amino acid with no charge (alanine, A) in the mutant Y1586A or with a negative charge (aspartic acid, D) in Y1586D produces time constants of recovery from short depolarization more similar to that of 1 than to that of Y1586K (Table 1). In contrast, Y1586R (n 4) shows an intermediate inactivation profile that is more similar to that of Y1586K than to that of 1 (Fig. Also, the voltage-dependent time constants of entry into and recovery from atypical inactivation in Y1586R (n 4) are quite similar to that of Y1586K (Fig. Support for the role of a positive charge in atypical inactivation also comes from the distinction in steady-state atypical inactivation (a ) between the mutants Y1586D (negatively charged) and Y1586A (uncharged) and the positively charged mutants Y1586K and Y1586R (Fig. T 1 he a curve for Y1586R (V1/2 99.9 0.3 mV, k 0.9 0.2; n 5) resembles Y1586K, while the other mutants are similar to 1 (Y1586A: V1/2 41.5 1.5 mV, k 10.9 1.4, n 5; Y1586D: V1/2 55.3 0.9 mV, k 12.5 0.8, n 6; Fig. In Y1586R, the slow inactivation protocol (50-ms interpulse) produces an inactivation profile similar to that of Y1586K, i.e., an atypical inactivation state and two slow inactivation states (Fig. Y1586R is also similar to Y1586K when the protocol has a 500-ms interpulse. The steady-state slow inactivation (s ) curves also demonstrate a similarity between Y1586K and Y1586R. 7 B shows that substitution of the positively charged arginine in Y1586R produces an s phenotype like that of Y1586K (Table 2).

Y1586K (V1/2 more inactivation at all voltages compared to 1 (V1/2 44.9 0.5 mV, k 10.1 0.4; n 5). In general, the mutants with a charged substitution (Y1586R and Y1586D) are similar to Y1586K, while recovery from slow inactivation in the uncharged Y1586A more closely resembles that in 1 (Table 2). These results demonstrate that a positive charge plays an important role in the inactivation phenotype of Y1586K and that this substitution affects typical slow inactivation and produces atypical inactivation. DISCUSSION In this study we have characterized activation and inactivation in a rat skeletal muscle NaCh mutant (Y1586K) that has a single amino acid substitution, lysine (K) for tyrosine (Y), at position 1586 in domain 4 segment 6 (D4-S6). Although Y1586K has activation and fast inactivation kinetics that differ somewhat from those of wild-type 1, the more marked difference is that Y1586K recovers more slowly and with a different time course than 1 from relatively short Biophysical Journal 78(2) 773784 780 O'Reilly et al. The altered recovery in Y1586K is due to entry into an additional, intermediate "atypical" inactivation state that is distinct from typical fast and slow inactivation. Other amino acid substitutions at Y1586 show that the positive charge of lysine (K) plays an important role in the inactivation phenotype of Y1586K. We hypothesize that a depolarization-induced conformational change alters the relative position of the D4-S6 segment and that atypical inactivation in Y1586K is due to an electrostatic interaction within or near the inner pore region. Activation and fast inactivation in Y1586 mutants and wild-type 1 Compared with 1, whole-cell macroscopic current decay is faster, the steady-state fast inactivation (h ) curve is less steep, and the activation (conductance-voltage) curve is shifted in the positive direction in the mutant Y1586K. For example, current decay in Y1586R (positively charged) is similar to that in Y1586K (also positively charged), but Y1586D (negatively charged) is also similar to Y1586K. Short depolarizations reveal an atypical inactivation state in Y1586K Y1586K recovers from relatively short depolarizations of 8 or 100 ms much more slowly and with a different time course compared with wild-type 1. The double-exponential recovery profile from 8-ms depolarization clearly demonstrates that Y1586K is recovering from two inactivation states. After 100 ms of depolarization, from which 1 FIGURE 5 (A) The standard slow inactivation protocol (inset), where the cell is depolarized to 0 mV for various times, hyperpolarized to allow recovery of fast-inactivated channels, and then depolarized with a test pulse to 50 mV, shows entry into atypical inactivation for Y1586K (n 8), which is much faster than slow inactivation in 1 (n 14). Modification of the protocol to a 500-ms interpulse (to allow recovery from atypical inactivation) demonstrates that development of typical slow inactivation is still present in Y1586K (n 10). Mean data SEM were fit with triple(Y1586K 50 ms) or double-exponential ( 1; Y1586K 500 ms) functions.

Short depolarizations show that entry into the atypical inactivation state in Y1586K is rapid and monoexponential and demonstrate that Y1586K can enter this atypical state from the fast-inactivated state. In addition to entry into atypical inactivation from the fast-inactivated state, the fit of the atypical inactivation time constants suggest a two-state model where Y1586K can enter the atypical inactivation state from the closed state (Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952; O'Leary, 1998). A simple state diagram illustrating the additional atypical inactivation state in Y1586K is presented in Fig. However, Y1586K inactivates readily ( 70% inactivation) within this time. Experiments in Y1586K with a longer interpulse hyperpolarization (500 ms) that allows recovery from atypical inactivation demonstrate that development of typical slow inactivation in Y1586K is still functionally present and similar to that in 1. In Y1586K, recovery from slow inactivation is slower and the s curve is shifted in the hyperpolarized direction compared to 1. This could be due to a stabilization of the slow inactivation state by the 1586K residue in Y1586K. Other amino acid substitutions at Y1586 suggest that the positive charge in lysine plays an important role in atypical inactivation in Y1586K We used other amino acid substitutions to evaluate the role of a specific amino acid residue (i.e., lysine, K) in atypical inactivation. Inactivation in Y1586R (positively charged) resembled that of Y1586K, that is, Y1586R also exhibits rapid inactivation in response to short depolarizations that appears to be entry into the atypical inactivation state. In contrast, the other substitutions (Y1586A, no charge; Y1586D, negatively charged) show little inactivation to the same protocol and resemble wild-type 1 rather than Y1586K. In addition, the time constants of inactivation (entry and recovery) and the data from the steady-state atypical inactivation protocol (a ) in Y1586R also resemble the atypical inactivation phenotype of Y1586K. These results lend support to the hypothesis that the positive charge on lysine (K) in the Y1586K mutant plays a prominent role in producing the atypical Biophysical Journal 78(2) 773784 782 O'Reilly et al. Substitutions at Y1586 affect steady-state slow inactivation and recovery from slow inactivation In the two mutants with positively charged amino acid substitutions, Y1586K and Y1586R, steady-state slow inactivation (s ) is shifted in the negative direction and is more complete than in wild-type 1. Potential mechanism for atypical inactivation in Y1586K Localized conformational changes associated with different kinetic states in NaChs has been suggested by studies of local anesthetic binding (Hille, 1977; Ragsdale et al., 1994; Wright et al., 1998).

In conclusion, we propose that atypical inactivation in Y1586K is dependent on a depolarization-induced conformational change that results in an altered position of the D4-S6 region. These results suggest that development of typical slow Biophysical Journal 78(2) 773784 778 TABLE 1 Recovery from short depolarizations for wild-type 1 and NaCh mutants Recovery from short depolarization to 50 mV: time constants (ms); component (%) Channel [n] Wild-type 1 [3] Y1586K [5] Y1586R [3] Y1586A [4] Y1586D [5] 2-ms pulse 1.1 1.3 1.9 1.2 1.0 0.02 0.06 0.1 0.02 0.03 8-ms pulse 1.4 1.4 65.7 2.6 37.1 1.7 1.2 0.07 0.1 (67) 6.7 (34) 0.4 (71) 7.9 (29) 0.07 0.05 100-ms pulse 1.7 110.3 57.5 1.6 1.4 0.08 3.6 7.9 0.09 0.07 O'Reilly et al. Other amino acid substitutions at position Y1586 To evaluate the role of a specific amino acid substitution (i.e., lysine, K) in the atypical inactivation, we also studied NaCh mutants with positively charged arginine (Y1586R), uncharged alanine (Y1586A), and negatively charged aspartic acid (Y1586D) substituted at the Y1586 position. All of these mutants (Y1586R, n 5; Y1586A, n 6; Y1586D, n 4) had right-shifted activation (conductancevoltage) curves (p 0.001 versus 1), although the slopes of the curves were not statistically different from that of 1 (Y1586R: 14.3 6.7 mV, k 8.8 4.5 mV; Y1586A: 0 22.5 1.6 mV, k 10.8 1.5 mV; Y1586D: 18.4 .5 mV, k 9.7 0.5 mV). The V1/2 of the steady-state fast inactivation (h ) curves for the mutants were Y1586R, 91.9 0.7 mV (p 0.001 vs. The slope factors (k) for the h curves were less steep for the mutants than for 1 (Y1586R: 9.4 0.6 mV, p 0.001; Y1586A: 6.6 0.1 mV, p 0.01; Y1586D: 6.4 0.2 mV, p 0.05). Macroscopic current decay was faster in Y1586R and Biophysical Journal 78(2) 773784 Y1586D than in 1 (0.21 0.01 ms, n 11; 0.22 0.01 ms, n 11, respectively; p 0.001) but did not differ between 1 and Y1586A (0.27 0.01 ms, n 9). Recovery from short depolarizations (2, 8, or 100 ms) in the mutant Y1586R, which carries a positive charge (as does lysine, K), is similar to that in Y1586K. The recovery profile of Y1586R from an 8-ms depolarization includes a component comparable to the atypical inactivation observed in Y1586K (Table 1). In contrast, Y1586R (n 4) shows an intermediate inactivation profile that is more similar to that of Y1586K than to that of 1 (Fig. Also, the voltage-dependent time constants of entry into and recovery from atypical inactivation in Y1586R (n 4) are quite similar to that of Y1586K (Fig. Support for the role of a positive charge in atypical inactivation also comes from the distinction in steady-state atypical inactivation (a ) between the mutants Y1586D (negatively charged) and Y1586A (uncharged) and the positively charged mutants Y1586K and Y1586R (Fig. T 1 he a curve for Y1586R (V1/2 99.9 0.3 mV, k 0.9 0.2; n 5) resembles Y1586K, while the other mutants are similar to 1 (Y1586A: V1/2 41.5 1.5 mV, k 10.9 1.4, n 5; Y1586D: V1/2 55.3 0.9 mV, k 12.5 0.8, n 6; Fig. 6 B) for Y1586R is 102.5 mV, which is similar to the experimentally determined V1/2 of 99.9 mV. In Y1586R, the slow inactivation protocol (50-ms interpulse) produces an inactivation profile similar to that of Y1586K, i.e., an atypical inactivation state and two slow inactivation states (Fig. Y1586R is also similar to Y1586K when the protocol has a 500-ms interpulse. The slow inactivation time constants with a 500-ms interpulse in Y1586R (n 3) are 4.2 0.3 ms (77%) and 49.2 12.5 ms (22%). The steady-state slow inactivation (s ) curves also demonstrate a similarity between Y1586K and Y1586R. 7 B shows that substitution of the positively charged arginine in Y1586R produces an s phenotype like that of Y1586K (Table 2). In general, the mutants with a charged substitution (Y1586R and Y1586D) are similar to Y1586K, while recovery from slow inactivation in the uncharged Y1586A more closely resembles that in 1 (Table 2). For example, current decay in Y1586R (positively charged) is similar to that in Y1586K (also positively charged), but Y1586D (negatively charged) is also similar to Y1586K.

Substitution of an amino acid with no charge (alanine, A) in the mutant Y1586A or with a negative charge (aspartic acid, D) in Y1586D produces time constants of recovery from short depolarization more similar to that of 1 than to that of Y1586K (Table 1).

Of the mutations made, T439Y, Y445C, D447N, and D447T did not give functional homomultimers, whereas T441C, V443G, and Y445F did. Mutations T441C and Y445F preserved selectivity for K over Na (not shown), whereas V443G destroyed channel selectivity, as has been shown earlier (Heginbotham et al., 1994). If the slow wash-out of Ba2 from Y445F channels was due w to the channel C-type inactivating on Ba2 , then Ba2 ash-out should be faster in 112 mM Kout, where C-type inactivation is slowed. This voltage dependence indicates that the bulk of the Ba2 dissociations for Y445F in 112 mM Kout were in the outward direction. This result suggests that the "enhancement" site is disrupted in Y445F channels, whereas the preservation of fast Ba2 block, as shown above, suggests that the "lock-in" site remains intact. Mutation Y445F lowers the affinity of a K binding site i on C-type inactivation with Ba2 Y445F channels i n the pore of Y445F had a fast component of block similar to wild-type ShB and an increased sensitivity to slow block (Fig. Increasing external K from 2 mM to 112 mM slowed C-type inactivation in Y445F by sixfold (Fig. This indicates that the K site that influences C-type inactivation in Y445F is intact. To determine if the fast closure of the C-type inactivation gate in Y445F was responsible for the slow time course of Ba2 wash-out rate, To test the above interpretation that Y445F disrupts the "enhancement" site, we compared wild-type ShB and Y445F with respect to the onset of Ba2 block in high external K . In contrast to wild-type ShB , Y445F preserved both the fast and slow components of block in 92 mM Kout, although both were reduced in magnitude and in rate compared to 2 mM Kout (compare Figs. This indicates that in Y445F channels Ba2 can reach its deep site, even in 92 mM Kout, and is consistent with a decreased occupancy of a low-affinity K binding site in Y445F channels. Because the fast and slow Ba2 binding sites were intact in Y445F channels (although the affinity of the deep site could not be ascertained because of the trapping by C-type inactivation), the low-affinity K binding site affected by this mutation seemed most likely to be the "enhancement" site.

Repeated depolarizations cause a decrease in Y445F current, unlike in wild-type ShB . This is probably due to accumulated C-type inactivation in Y445F. (C) Ba2 wash-out of Y445F is faster (p 0.05) with 112 mM Kout ( off 116 19.3 s, n 4) than 2 mM Kout ( off 1670 390 s, n 8), suggesting that 112 mM Kout slows C-8ype inactivation, allowing Ba2 to dissociate more quickly (Vhold t 0 mV; Vstep 40 mV). FIGURE 9 Mutation Y445F disrupts a K ion binding site. (A) Ba2 off rates for Y445F were significantly faster (p 0.01) for steps to 80 mV 3n 9) than 20 mV (Vhold ( 80 mV; Vstep 40 mV; step duration c 0 ms; 0.2 Hz). (C) 1 ash-in of Ba2 has two components for Y445F in 112 mM Kout ( 1 W 09.6 0.847 s; amp1 0.618 0.028; 2 232.9 19.4 s; amp2 .284 0.026; n 7). The mutation Y445F eliminated enhancement of inward b Ba2 dissociation in high external K . Because two properties that b we associate with the "lock-in" site-- high-affinity K inding and fast Ba2 block--were unaffected, we think that the mutation Y445F does not affect the "lock-in" site. (1996), which showed that Y445F disrupts a K ion binding site near the external mouth of the pore. Y445F lowers the affinity of K for the "enhancement" site (site 2), T441C lowers the affinity of Ba2 for the deep site (site 3), and V443G lowers an b energetic barrier between the external "lock-in" site and the deep Ba2 lock site. Of the mutations made, T439Y, Y445C, D447N, and D447T did not give functional homomultimers, whereas T441C, V443G, and Y445F did. Of the mutations made, T439Y, Y445C, D447N, and D447T did not give functional homomultimers, whereas T441C, V443G, and Y445F did. Mutations T441C and Y445F preserved selectivity for K over Na (not shown), whereas V443G destroyed channel selectivity, as has been shown earlier (Heginbotham et al., 1994). V443G accelerated the kinetics of block without altering the total fraction bound (Fig. One possibility is that, unlike T441C, which altered binding of Ba2 at its deep site, V443G left binding normal, but eased the entry and exit of Ba2 to and from the deep site, by reducing an energy barrier to Ba2 movement. (B) Mutation V443G increased Ba2 blocking kinetics so much that the time constants of block could not be determined. V443G accelerated block kinetics even more than b T441C, but preserved the overall steady-state level of Ba2 lock. Because V443G destroys selectivity (Heginbotham et al., 1994), it is possible that it is the selectivity filter that constitutes such an energy barrier, perhaps involving a constriction in the pore at or near this site. Y445F lowers the affinity of K for the "enhancement" site (site 2), T441C lowers the affinity of Ba2 for the deep site (site 3), and V443G lowers an b energetic barrier between the external "lock-in" site and the deep Ba2 lock site. Of the mutations made, T439Y, Y445C, D447N, and D447T did not give functional homomultimers, whereas T441C, V443G, and Y445F did.

Of the mutations made, T439Y, Y445C, D447N, and D447T did not give functional homomultimers, whereas T441C, V443G, and Y445F did. Mutations T441C and Y445F preserved selectivity for K over Na (not shown), whereas V443G destroyed channel selectivity, as has been shown earlier (Heginbotham et al., 1994). b T441C greatly reduced the slow component of Ba2 lock (from 63% to 19%, p 10 5; Fig. One possibility is that, unlike T441C, which altered binding of Ba2 at its deep site, V443G left binding normal, but eased the entry and exit of Ba2 to and from the deep site, by reducing an energy barrier to Ba2 movement. (A) Mutation T441C had a fast Ba2 block similar to that of wild-type ShB (T441C Fraction unblocked 0.566 0.024, n 6; wild-type ShB Fraction unblocked 0 .650 0.013, n 6); however, the fraction unblocked of the slow component was significantly increased (p 1 10 5) for T441C (0.813 0.042, n 3) compared to wild-type ShB (0.375 0.0313, n 6 ). The time constant for wash-out for T441C is 17.00 4.98 s (n s ), which is significantly shorter (p 4.56 10 2) than that of wild-type ShB (27.86 1.75 s, n 6). T441C decreased the affinity of the slow Ba2 block site by increasing the Ba2 off rate, without affecting the affinity of the fast block site. V443G accelerated block kinetics even more than b T441C, but preserved the overall steady-state level of Ba2 lock. Y445F lowers the affinity of K for the "enhancement" site (site 2), T441C lowers the affinity of Ba2 for the deep site (site 3), and V443G lowers an b energetic barrier between the external "lock-in" site and the deep Ba2 lock site.

Mg2 modulates activation gating in the D274A mut ant channel w ith the same k inetic ef fects and apparent af fin it y as the w ild t ype (6). These values are not directly c omparable, however, because the ef fects of Ni2 on w ild-t ype and D274A channels were assessed in dif ferent c onfor mations, the open st ate and a closed st ate, respectively. Effect of Ni2 on application of D274A channels revealed a novel phenot ype. D274A channels were highly sensitive to Ni2 , but, d rather than changing the time c ourse of channel open ing, Ni2 ecreased the current amplitude w ith no detect able change in activation k inetics (Fig. These results indicate that Ni2 revents activation gating in D274A channels. The half-max imal c oncentration for the decline in current amplitude in D274A channels was 3 M, which is sign ificantly lower than 2936 www.pnas.org cgi doi 10.1073 pnas.0636603100 Opening of D274A Channels. We now report that D274A Channels Reversed by Neutralizing R353 in S4. Ni2 to Prev ious work in Shaker channels suggests a str uctural basis for the novel ef fect of Ni2 on D274A channels (22, 23). Similar to D274A in eag, a neutralization mut ation of E283, E283Q, does not eliminate functional ex pression of Shaker (15). To test this hypothesis, we made the neutralization mut ations R353Q and R356Q, paired them indiv idually w ith D274A, and investigated the ef fect of extracellular Ni2 on the double-mut ant channels. Combin ing R353Q w ith D274A restored the abilit y of the eag channel to open in the presence of Ni2 (Fig. This result strongly suggests that Ni2 specifically prevents movement of positively charged R353 into the gating pocket in the D274A channel. As in w ild-t ype eag, Ni2 sign ificantly slowed activation i f D274A R353Q channels. In c ontrast, Ni2 prevented open ing of D274A R356Q channels (Fig. As in D274A, application of Ni2 resulted in a decline in current amplitude w ith no sign ificant change in activation k inetics. That Ni2 prevents open ing of D274A R356Q channels suggests that movement of R353 into the pocket is a prerequisite for the movement of R356; that is, there is sequential movement of R353 and R356 into the extracellular pocket.

Our results indicate that Ni2 prevents open ing of D274A channels by preventing the movement of R353 into the extracellular gating pocket, presumably by electrost atic repulsion. We obser ve that Ni2 dramatically slows activation in D274A R353Q channels, as it does in w ild t ype (Fig. We now propose that analogous c onfor mational changes oc cur during activation of eag channels and that in D274A mut ant channels, the presence of Ni2 prevents the movement of one or more S4 residues into the extracellular pocket that c ont ains both the D274A mut ation and the ionbinding site.

We propose that in D274A, Ni2 specifically blocks the transition in which R3 moves Silverman et al. We speculate that one or more of these residues sticks into the extracellular gating pocket and prevents entr y of the charged S4 residues, thereby block ing activation gating in Kv2.1 similarly to Ni2 in the D274A eag mut ant channel. 
10920073	Kass, PhD Background--D1790G, a mutation of SCN5A, the gene that encodes the human Na channel -subunit, is linked to 1 form of the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQT-3). In contrast to other LQT-3linked SCN5A mutations, D1790G does not promote sustained Na channel activity but instead alters the kinetics and voltage-dependence of the inactivated state. On this background, we modified only the properties of the voltage-gated Na channel according to our patch-clamp analysis of D1790G channels. Our results indicate that D1790G-induced changes in Na channel activity prolong APs in a steeply heart rate dependent manner not directly due to changes in Na entry through mutant channels but instead to alterations in the balance of net plateau currents by modulation of calcium-sensitive exchange and ion channel currents. Conclusions--We conclude that the D1790G mutation of the Na channel -subunit can prolong the cardiac ventricular AP despite the absence of mutation-induced sustained Na channel current. 2000;102:584-590.) Key Words: sodium calcium arrhythmia torsad de pointes action potentials he congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS) is an inherited cardiac disorder that is defined in part by prolonged ventricular repolarization, an association with recurrent syncope, a propensity to polymorphous ventricular tachycardia (torsade de pointes), and sudden death.1,2 Multiple genes that encode ion channel subunits have now been shown to be linked to LQTS,3 and in most cases, the functional properties of the mutant gene products are consistent with the disease phenotype, ie, increase of inward or decrease of outward plateau current.4,5 LQT-3 is linked to the gene encoding the -subunit of the cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel (SCN5A on chromosome 3).6 Functional analysis of initially reported SCN5A mutations revealed mutant Na channels that fail to inactivate completely on prolonged depolarization7,8 and produce a small but functionally important enhancement of inward plateau current sufficient to delay repolarization and increase vulnerability of the heart to arrhythmias.9 All subsequently reported LQT-3 mutations with the exception of D1790G (DG) promote sustained Na current and are expected to prolong repolarization through this common mechanism.9 14 The purpose of the present study was to use a computational approach to determine whether or not the biophysical T properties of DG mutant Na channels might affect the cellular action potential (AP) through mechanisms other than a direct contribution to maintained Na channel plateau current.

Immunofluorescence studies indicated that the expressed TRPL, TRPL (W713G) and TRPL (W814G) proteins are located at the plasma membrane. TRPL oocytes (oocytes injected with trpl cRNA) and TRPL (W814G) oocytes [oocytes injected with trpl (W814G) cRNA] exhibited substantially greater rates of basal (constitutive) Ca#+ inflow (measured using fluo-3 and the Ca#+ add-back protocol) than mock-injected oocytes (mock oocytes). In TRPL and TRPL (W814G) [oocytes injected with trpl (W713G) cRNA], but not in TRPL (W713G) oocytes, basal Ca#+ inflow was inhibited by W13, an inhibitor of calmodulin action.

Two possible explanations for the incomplete prevention of the inhibition of basal Ca#+ inflow by exogenous calmodulin in TRPL (W814G) are that mutation W814G only partially prevents the binding of calmodulin to Site 2, or that region 809825 does not constitute calmodulin-binding Site 2, as suggested recently by Warr and Kelly [26]. The idea that the binding of Ca#+ and calmodulin to calmodulin-binding Site 1 activates TRPL is consistent with the observations that (a) the mutation W713G, but not the mutation W814G, abolishes basal (constitutive) Ca#+ inflow through TRPL channels, and (b) W13, which inhibits calmodulin in a Ca#+-dependent manner [32], inhibits Ca#+ inflow in oocytes expressing TRPL and TRPL (W814G) channels but not in oocytes expressing TRPL (W713G) channels. The W814G mutation, which should not directly affect the binding of calmodulin to calmodulin-binding Site 1, caused some decrease in the basal sustained rate of Ca#+ inflow. The results obtained with TRPL (W814G) and the microinjection of exogenous calmodulin (3 M) are more difficult to interpret. The mutation W814G largely prevented the ability of exogenous calmodulin to inhibit the basal Ca#+ inflow through TRPL. The results for Ca#+ inflow obtained with mutant TRPL (W713G) and mutant TRPL (W814G) oocytes indicate that the ability of InsP to activate $ TRPL does not depend on the binding of Ca#+calmodulin to calmodulin-binding Sites 1 or 2. As discussed above, since mutation W814G may not inhibit the binding of calmodulin to calmodulin-binding Site 2, the possibility that calmodulin-binding Site 2 is involved in the activation of TRPL by InsP cannot $ be completely eliminated. Wild-type TRPL protein and two mutant forms, TRPL (W713G) and TRPL (W814G), in which a key tryptophan residue in each of the two putative calmodulin-binding sites (Sites 1 and 2, respectively) was replaced by glycine, were expressed heterologously in Xenopus lae is oocytes. Immunofluorescence studies indicated that the expressed TRPL, TRPL (W713G) and TRPL (W814G) proteins are located at the plasma membrane. In TRPL (W713G) oocytes, this difference was abolished. In TRPL and TRPL (W814G) [oocytes injected with trpl (W713G) cRNA], but not in TRPL (W713G) oocytes, basal Ca#+ inflow was inhibited by W13, an inhibitor of calmodulin action. Calmodulin (3 M intracellular) inhibited basal Ca#+ inflow in TRPL but not in TRPL (W713G) or TRPL (W814G) oocytes. Rates of InsP -stimulated Ca#+ inflow through the TRPL, TRPL $ (W713G) and TRPL (W814G) channels were similar. The ability of GTPS to stimulate Ca#+ inflow through TRPL channels was inhibited by 50 % in TRPL (W713G) oocytes but was unaffected in TRPL (W814G) oocytes. In the environment of the oocyte, TRPL was found to be constitutively active at basal concentrations of Ca#+ and cal- Abbreviations used : TRPL, transient-receptor-potential-like ; TRPL (W713G) and TRPL (W814G) oocytes, oocytes microinjected with trpl, trpl (W713G) and trpl (W814G) cRNA, respectively ; mock oocytes, oocytes microinjected without the introduction of a solution to the oocyte cytoplasmic space ; [Ca2+]c, cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ; Ca2+o, extracellular Ca2+ ; InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ; RACC, receptor-activated Ca2+ channel ; SER, smooth endoplasmic reticulum ; PKC, protein kinase C ; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline ; TRP, transient receptor potential.

Activation by GTP-binding proteins Role of calmodulin in the activation of TRPL by InsP3 To determine whether calmodulin is involved in the activation of TRPL by InsP , the ability of InsP to stimulate Ca#+ inflow in $ $ TRPL (W713G), TRPL (W814G) and TRPL oocytes was compared. As described above, TRPL (W713G) oocytes did not exhibit an enhanced basal rate of Ca#+ inflow when compared with TRPL oocytes or TRPL (W814G) oocytes (Table 4, None). Oocytes expressing TRPL, TRPL (W713G) or TRPL (W814G) each expressed similar rates of Ca#+ inflow in the presence of It has previously been shown that in the environments of the oocyte [15] and insect Sf9 cells [12,13], TRPL is activated by GTPS. The effects of the micro-injection of GTPS on the Ca#+o-induced increase in fluo-3 fluorescence in oocytes expressing TRPL, TRPL (W713G) or TRPL (W814G) are shown in Figure 5(a)5(c).

The rates of Ca2+ inflow (calculated from the slopes of the plots over the time period 520 min) for TRPL, TRPL (W713G) and TRPL (W814G) oocytes each treated with GTPS and for TRPL oocytes in the absence of GTPS were : 1.31p0.14, 0.78p0.1, 1.14p0.13 and 0.06p0.03 (fluorescence units):min per oocyte (meanspS.E.M. The degrees of significance for the rates of Ca2+ inflow in TRPL oocytes compared with mock oocytes, TRPL (W713G) oocytes compared with mock oocytes and TRPL (W814G) oocytes compared with mock oocytes are : P 0.001, P l 0.05 and P 0.001, respectively. The degree of significance for a comparison of the rate of change of fluorescence in the TRPL oocytes with the rate in TRPL (W713G) oocytes is P 0.05. This substantial stimulation of Ca#+ inflow by GTPS is also observed in TRPL (W814G) oocytes (Figure 5c) but is greatly reduced in oocytes expressing TRPL (W713G) (Figure 5b). Comparison of calculated rates of Ca#+ inflow (legend of Figure 5) indicates that introduction of the TRPL (W713G) mutation causes about 50 % inhibition of GTPS-stimulated Ca#+ inflow compared with the rate of inflow in TRPL oocytes. The idea that the binding of Ca#+ and calmodulin to calmodulin-binding Site 1 activates TRPL is consistent with the observations that (a) the mutation W713G, but not the mutation W814G, abolishes basal (constitutive) Ca#+ inflow through TRPL channels, and (b) W13, which inhibits calmodulin in a Ca#+-dependent manner [32], inhibits Ca#+ inflow in oocytes expressing TRPL and TRPL (W814G) channels but not in oocytes expressing TRPL (W713G) channels. The present results obtained with TRPL (W713G) together with those of Warr and Kelly [26], who measured the binding of calmodulin to peptides composed of sequences surrounding andor including calmodulin-binding Site 1, indicate that (a) the binding of Ca#+ and calmodulin to calmodulin-binding Site 1 activates TRPL and (b) this action of calmodulin may be responsible for the activation of TRPL channels in insect Sf9 cells and oocytes at basal or slightly elevated [Ca#+]c. The results for Ca#+ inflow obtained with mutant TRPL (W713G) and mutant TRPL (W814G) oocytes indicate that the ability of InsP to activate $ TRPL does not depend on the binding of Ca#+calmodulin to calmodulin-binding Sites 1 or 2. The observation that the mutation W713G in calmodulin-binding Site 1 (which completely inhibited the constitutive activity of TRPL) caused a 50 % reduction in the activation of TRPL initiated by GTPS indicates that there are at least two pathways by which GTPS induces the activation of TRPL in the environment of the oocyte.

Mutations V1454A, F1456A, I1458A, F1459A, T1464A, V1471A, and I1472A also caused significant negative shifts in voltage dependence of activation (Fig. Mutations V1454A, F1456A, I1458A, F1459A, T1464A, V1471A, and I1472A also caused significant negative shifts in voltage dependence of activation (Fig. All mutations except I1458A and F1468A make relatively small ( 1 kcal) perturbations in G0, indicating that the change in energy of interaction for any single residue is relatively small. Only I1458A caused a significant negative shift (Fig. Mutations L1465A and I1469A decreased affinity of inactivated Na channels up to 8-fold for the anticonvulsant lamotrigine and its congeners 227c89, 4030w92, and 619c89 as well as for the local anesthetic etidocaine. For example, the voltage for half-maximal activation of mutants L1467A, F1468A, and I1469A was shifted by 5, 14, and 8 mV, respectively (Fig. A, conductance-voltage curves for wild-type, L1467A, F1468A, and I1469A. A, steady-state inactivation curves for wild-type, L1465A, L1467A, and I1469A. In contrast, mutations I1473A and I1469A caused significant positive shifts in the voltage dependence of Role of Sodium Channel IIIS6 in Gating and Drug Block inactivation (Fig. The two mutations giving positive shifts (I1469A and I1473A) are four residues apart, and mutations F1463A, L1467A, and V1471A, which define local peaks in the negative shifts of inactivation, are also four residues apart in the sequence. L1465A and I1469A decreased the affinity of lamotrigine for the inactivated state of the channel, resulting in 8- and 3-fold increases in KI, respectively (Fig. Both L1465A and I1469A caused positive shifts in voltage dependence of activation (Fig. Because mutations L1465A and I1469A had effects on the affinity of lamotrigine, we examined the affinities of these mutants for the structurally related compounds 4030w92 and 227c89 as well as the structurally unrelated local anesthetic etidocaine. L1465A, N1466A, and I1469A decreased the affinity of 4030w92 5-, 3-, and 5-fold, respectively (Fig. Block by compound 227c89 was disrupted in L1465A and I1469A mutants by about 3-fold (Fig. Larger disruptions in block by etidocaine were observed with mutations L1465A, N1466A, and I1469A resulting in 6-, 8-, and 7-fold increases in KI, respectively (Fig. Thus, mutations L1465A and I1469A decreased the affinity of all compounds tested substantially.

Mutations L1465A, N1466A, and I1469A increased affinity of lamotrigine for resting channels approximately 2-fold (Fig. In contrast, I1469A did not affect the affinity of etidocaine for resting channels (Fig. Effect of Mutations F1462A, L1465A, N1466A, and I1469A on Frequency-dependent Block of Na Channels--Frequencydependent block of Na channels is observed for drugs that bind to the channel rapidly in the open state and then bind with high affinity to the inactivated state (8, 9). Only I1469A significantly reduced frequency-dependent block by 619c89 compared with the wildtype (Fig. Mutations L1465A and I1469A significantly reduced use-dependent block by etidocaine during 2-Hz trains (Fig. Effects of Mutations F1462A, L1465A, N1466A, and I1469A on Recovery of Na Channels from Inactivated-state Block-- Recovery of drug-blocked inactivated Na channels to the resting state was studied for the IIIS6 mutants that affected voltage- and/or frequency-dependent block of Na channels by 619c89 and etidocaine.

F1462A and I1469A recovered with drug values of 1.7 0.3 s and 2.0 0.3 s, respectively, which were not significantly different from the wild-type channels. We also examined the rate of onset of block by 619c89 and etidocaine of F1462A, L1465A, N1466A, and I1469A during depolarizations. Mutations F1462A, L1465A, N1466A, I1469A, and I1473A induced positive shifts of the voltage for half-maximal activation and positive G0 values (Figs. State-dependent Effects of Mutations in the IIIS6 Segment--In contrast to their inhibitory effects on inactivatedstate block, mutations L1465A, N1466A, and I1469A increased resting-state block by lamotrigine. L1465A and N1466A also increased resting-state block by etidocaine, but I1469A had no effect. Mutations L1465A and I1469A reduced frequency-dependent block by etidocaine, and I1469A reduced frequency-dependent block by 619c89. Measurement of on- and off-rates of 619c89 and etidocaine for L1465A, N1466A, and I1469A revealed different effects of these mutations on the kinetics of interaction of these drugs with their receptor site. In contrast, L1465A decreased the onset rate of etidocaine block, whereas N1466A and I1469A had no effect. The rate of recovery from 619c89-bound channels at the resting membrane potential was faster for I1469A and slower for L1465A. In contrast, L1465A induced faster recovery of etidocaine-bound channels and I1469A had no significant effect. Thus, both faster recovery from block and reduced inactivated-state affinity contribute to the reduction in frequencydependent block by I1469A, whereas reduced inactivated-state affinity is the primary effect for L1465A. Reduced affinity for inactivated channels, slower onset rate, and faster recovery rate all contribute to the large decrease in frequency-dependent block of L1465A by etidocaine, whereas the smaller effect of I1469A on frequency-dependent block is due entirely to reduced affinity for inactivated-state block. Mutations F1764A and Y1771A in segment IVS6 reduced affinity of inactivated Na channels for the local anesthetic etidocaine by up to two orders of magnitude (12). To identify functionally important residues in transmembrane segment IIIS6, we substituted alanine for individual native amino acid residues from Val-1454 to Ile-1473. Significant negative shifts were also caused by mutations F1463A, N1466A, F1468A, G1470A, V1471A, and I1472A (Fig. The two mutations giving positive shifts (I1469A and I1473A) are four residues apart, and mutations F1463A, L1467A, and V1471A, which define local peaks in the negative shifts of inactivation, are also four residues apart in the sequence. Mutations V1454A, F1456A, I1458A, F1459A, T1464A, V1471A, and I1472A also caused significant negative shifts in voltage dependence of activation (Fig. In contrast, mutations G1460A, F1462A, L1465A, N1466A, G1470A, and I1473A caused significant positive shifts (Fig. B, angular frequency of positive shifts in G0 determined for mutations of residues in the intracellular portion of IIIS6 between F1462A and I1473A (26, 36).

In contrast, mutations F1462A and N1466A substantially increased frequency-dependent block. In contrast, mutations N1466A and F1462A had little effect on frequency-dependent block by etidocaine (Fig. Effects of Mutations F1462A, L1465A, N1466A, and I1469A on Recovery of Na Channels from Inactivated-state Block-- Recovery of drug-blocked inactivated Na channels to the resting state was studied for the IIIS6 mutants that affected voltage- and/or frequency-dependent block of Na channels by 619c89 and etidocaine. drug for F1462A was not significantly different (379 27 ms) (Fig. F1462A and I1469A recovered with drug values of 1.7 0.3 s and 2.0 0.3 s, respectively, which were not significantly different from the wild-type channels. We also examined the rate of onset of block by 619c89 and etidocaine of F1462A, L1465A, N1466A, and I1469A during depolarizations. Only F1462A affected onset block by 619c89 significantly. Mutations F1462A, L1465A, N1466A, I1469A, and I1473A induced positive shifts of the voltage for half-maximal activation and positive G0 values (Figs. Mutations V1454A, F1456A, I1458A, F1459A, T1464A, V1471A, and I1472A also caused significant negative shifts in voltage dependence of activation (Fig. N1466A decreased affinity of inactivated Na channels for the anticonvulsant 4030w92 and etidocaine by 3- and 8-fold, respectively, but had no effect on affinity of the other tested compounds. In contrast, mutations G1460A, F1462A, L1465A, N1466A, G1470A, and I1473A caused significant positive shifts (Fig. The steepness of the voltage dependence of the activation process (k 5.4 0.1 mV for wild-type) was significantly decreased by mutations L1465A (k 6.2 0.2 mV), N1466A (k 6.5 0.2 mV), and L1467A (k 7.6 0.2 mV). Significant negative shifts were also caused by mutations F1463A, N1466A, F1468A, G1470A, V1471A, and I1472A (Fig. L1465A, N1466A, and I1469A decreased the affinity of 4030w92 5-, 3-, and 5-fold, respectively (Fig. Larger disruptions in block by etidocaine were observed with mutations L1465A, N1466A, and I1469A resulting in 6-, 8-, and 7-fold increases in KI, respectively (Fig. In contrast, mutation N1466A caused the largest disruption of etidocaine binding but had no effect on binding of compound 227c89 or of lamotrigine and 619c89.

Mutations L1465A, N1466A, and I1469A increased affinity of lamotrigine for resting channels approximately 2-fold (Fig. L1465A and N1466A also increased affinity of etidocaine for resting channels 3-fold (Fig. Effect of Mutations F1462A, L1465A, N1466A, and I1469A on Frequency-dependent Block of Na Channels--Frequencydependent block of Na channels is observed for drugs that bind to the channel rapidly in the open state and then bind with high affinity to the inactivated state (8, 9). In contrast, mutations F1462A and N1466A substantially increased frequency-dependent block. In contrast, mutations N1466A and F1462A had little effect on frequency-dependent block by etidocaine (Fig. Effects of Mutations F1462A, L1465A, N1466A, and I1469A on Recovery of Na Channels from Inactivated-state Block-- Recovery of drug-blocked inactivated Na channels to the resting state was studied for the IIIS6 mutants that affected voltage- and/or frequency-dependent block of Na channels by 619c89 and etidocaine. Recovery from block of both L1465A and N1466A was about 2-fold slower than for wild-type channels with drug values of 710 61 ms and 820 3 0 ms, respectively. The slower dissociation of 619c89 from L1465A would counteract the effect of reduction in binding affinity by that mutation, and the slower dissociation from N1466A would enhance frequency-dependent block. L1465A and N1466A recovered with drug values of 0.76 0.05 s and 1.05 0.05 s, respectively (Fig. We also examined the rate of onset of block by 619c89 and etidocaine of F1462A, L1465A, N1466A, and I1469A during depolarizations. Mutations F1462A, L1465A, N1466A, I1469A, and I1473A induced positive shifts of the voltage for half-maximal activation and positive G0 values (Figs. Mutations L1465A, N1466A, and G1470A produced opposite shifts of the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation, shifting activation to more positive potentials and inactivation to more negative potentials. Mutation N1466A also reduced inactivated-state block by compound 4070w92 and had a particularly strong effect on block by etidocaine. Only mutation N1466A revealed drug-specific differences. State-dependent Effects of Mutations in the IIIS6 Segment--In contrast to their inhibitory effects on inactivatedstate block, mutations L1465A, N1466A, and I1469A increased resting-state block by lamotrigine. L1465A and N1466A also increased resting-state block by etidocaine, but I1469A had no effect. Measurement of on- and off-rates of 619c89 and etidocaine for L1465A, N1466A, and I1469A revealed different effects of these mutations on the kinetics of interaction of these drugs with their receptor site. In contrast, L1465A decreased the onset rate of etidocaine block, whereas N1466A and I1469A had no effect. Increased use-dependent block of N1466A by 619c89 is due to slower recovery rate from block by this compound. For example, the voltage for half-maximal activation of mutants L1467A, F1468A, and I1469A was shifted by 5, 14, and 8 mV, respectively (Fig. A, conductance-voltage curves for wild-type, L1467A, F1468A, and I1469A. The steepness of the voltage dependence of the activation process (k 5.4 0.1 mV for wild-type) was significantly decreased by mutations L1465A (k 6.2 0.2 mV), N1466A (k 6.5 0.2 mV), and L1467A (k 7.6 0.2 mV). A, steady-state inactivation curves for wild-type, L1465A, L1467A, and I1469A. For example, the voltages for half-maximal inactivation of mutations L1465A and L1467A were shifted by 11 and 14 mV, respectively (Fig. The two mutations giving positive shifts (I1469A and I1473A) are four residues apart, and mutations F1463A, L1467A, and V1471A, which define local peaks in the negative shifts of inactivation, are also four residues apart in the sequence. Mutations V1454A, F1456A, I1458A, F1459A, T1464A, V1471A, and I1472A also caused significant negative shifts in voltage dependence of activation (Fig. Significant negative shifts were also caused by mutations F1463A, N1466A, F1468A, G1470A, V1471A, and I1472A (Fig. The two mutations giving positive shifts (I1469A and I1473A) are four residues apart, and mutations F1463A, L1467A, and V1471A, which define local peaks in the negative shifts of inactivation, are also four residues apart in the sequence. For example, the voltage for half-maximal activation of mutants L1467A, F1468A, and I1469A was shifted by 5, 14, and 8 mV, respectively (Fig. A, conductance-voltage curves for wild-type, L1467A, F1468A, and I1469A. All mutations except I1458A and F1468A make relatively small ( 1 kcal) perturbations in G0, indicating that the change in energy of interaction for any single residue is relatively small. Significant negative shifts were also caused by mutations F1463A, N1466A, F1468A, G1470A, V1471A, and I1472A (Fig. Mutations F1764A and Y1771A in segment IVS6 reduced affinity of inactivated Na channels for the local anesthetic etidocaine by up to two orders of magnitude (12). Catterall From the Department of Pharmacology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195-7280 and the Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Glaxo-Wellcome Ltd., Stevenage, United Kingdom Mutations of amino acid residues in the inner twothirds of the S6 segment in domain III of the rat brain type IIA Na channel (G1460A to I1473A) caused periodic positive and negative shifts in the voltage dependence of activation, consistent with an -helix having one face on which mutations to alanine oppose activation. In contrast, mutations G1460A, F1462A, L1465A, N1466A, G1470A, and I1473A caused significant positive shifts (Fig. This pattern is interrupted at G1460A, mutation of which produces a strongly positive G0 value. Mutations V1454A, F1456A, I1458A, F1459A, T1464A, V1471A, and I1472A also caused significant negative shifts in voltage dependence of activation (Fig. Mutations L1465A and I1469A decreased affinity of inactivated Na channels up to 8-fold for the anticonvulsant lamotrigine and its congeners 227c89, 4030w92, and 619c89 as well as for the local anesthetic etidocaine. In contrast, mutations G1460A, F1462A, L1465A, N1466A, G1470A, and I1473A caused significant positive shifts (Fig. The steepness of the voltage dependence of the activation process (k 5.4 0.1 mV for wild-type) was significantly decreased by mutations L1465A (k 6.2 0.2 mV), N1466A (k 6.5 0.2 mV), and L1467A (k 7.6 0.2 mV). A, steady-state inactivation curves for wild-type, L1465A, L1467A, and I1469A. For example, the voltages for half-maximal inactivation of mutations L1465A and L1467A were shifted by 11 and 14 mV, respectively (Fig. L1465A and I1469A decreased the affinity of lamotrigine for the inactivated state of the channel, resulting in 8- and 3-fold increases in KI, respectively (Fig. Both L1465A and I1469A caused positive shifts in voltage dependence of activation (Fig. Because mutations L1465A and I1469A had effects on the affinity of lamotrigine, we examined the affinities of these mutants for the structurally related compounds 4030w92 and 227c89 as well as the structurally unrelated local anesthetic etidocaine. L1465A, N1466A, and I1469A decreased the affinity of 4030w92 5-, 3-, and 5-fold, respectively (Fig. Block by compound 227c89 was disrupted in L1465A and I1469A mutants by about 3-fold (Fig. Larger disruptions in block by etidocaine were observed with mutations L1465A, N1466A, and I1469A resulting in 6-, 8-, and 7-fold increases in KI, respectively (Fig. Thus, mutations L1465A and I1469A decreased the affinity of all compounds tested substantially. Effect of Mutations L1465A, N1466A, and I1469A on Block of 24 Role of Sodium Channel IIIS6 in Gating and Drug Block FIG. Mutations L1465A, N1466A, and I1469A increased affinity of lamotrigine for resting channels approximately 2-fold (Fig. L1465A and N1466A also increased affinity of etidocaine for resting channels 3-fold (Fig. Effect of Mutations F1462A, L1465A, N1466A, and I1469A on Frequency-dependent Block of Na Channels--Frequencydependent block of Na channels is observed for drugs that bind to the channel rapidly in the open state and then bind with high affinity to the inactivated state (8, 9). Surprisingly, given the reduced affinity of these inactivated channels for block by 619c89, L1465A had no significant effect on fre- FIG. Mutations L1465A and I1469A significantly reduced use-dependent block by etidocaine during 2-Hz trains (Fig. Effects of Mutations F1462A, L1465A, N1466A, and I1469A on Recovery of Na Channels from Inactivated-state Block-- Recovery of drug-blocked inactivated Na channels to the resting state was studied for the IIIS6 mutants that affected voltage- and/or frequency-dependent block of Na channels by 619c89 and etidocaine. Recovery from block of both L1465A and N1466A was about 2-fold slower than for wild-type channels with drug values of 710 61 ms and 820 3 0 ms, respectively. The slower dissociation of 619c89 from L1465A would counteract the effect of reduction in binding affinity by that mutation, and the slower dissociation from N1466A would enhance frequency-dependent block. L1465A and N1466A recovered with drug values of 0.76 0.05 s and 1.05 0.05 s, respectively (Fig. We also examined the rate of onset of block by 619c89 and etidocaine of F1462A, L1465A, N1466A, and I1469A during depolarizations. Only L1465A had a significant effect on the rate of onset of block by etidocaine, which was 3-fold slower compared with the wildtype channel (data not shown). Mutations F1462A, L1465A, N1466A, I1469A, and I1473A induced positive shifts of the voltage for half-maximal activation and positive G0 values (Figs. Mutations L1465A, N1466A, and G1470A produced opposite shifts of the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation, shifting activation to more positive potentials and inactivation to more negative potentials. State-dependent Effects of Mutations in the IIIS6 Segment--In contrast to their inhibitory effects on inactivatedstate block, mutations L1465A, N1466A, and I1469A increased resting-state block by lamotrigine. L1465A and N1466A also increased resting-state block by etidocaine, but I1469A had no effect. Mutations L1465A and I1469A reduced frequency-dependent block by etidocaine, and I1469A reduced frequency-dependent block by 619c89. Measurement of on- and off-rates of 619c89 and etidocaine for L1465A, N1466A, and I1469A revealed different effects of these mutations on the kinetics of interaction of these drugs with their receptor site. In contrast, L1465A decreased the onset rate of etidocaine block, whereas N1466A and I1469A had no effect. The rate of recovery from 619c89-bound channels at the resting membrane potential was faster for I1469A and slower for L1465A. In contrast, L1465A induced faster recovery of etidocaine-bound channels and I1469A had no significant effect. Thus, both faster recovery from block and reduced inactivated-state affinity contribute to the reduction in frequencydependent block by I1469A, whereas reduced inactivated-state affinity is the primary effect for L1465A. Reduced affinity for inactivated channels, slower onset rate, and faster recovery rate all contribute to the large decrease in frequency-dependent block of L1465A by etidocaine, whereas the smaller effect of I1469A on frequency-dependent block is due entirely to reduced affinity for inactivated-state block. Mutations V1454A, F1456A, I1458A, F1459A, T1464A, V1471A, and I1472A also caused significant negative shifts in voltage dependence of activation (Fig. Significant negative shifts were also caused by mutations F1463A, N1466A, F1468A, G1470A, V1471A, and I1472A (Fig. Catterall From the Department of Pharmacology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195-7280 and the Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Glaxo-Wellcome Ltd., Stevenage, United Kingdom Mutations of amino acid residues in the inner twothirds of the S6 segment in domain III of the rat brain type IIA Na channel (G1460A to I1473A) caused periodic positive and negative shifts in the voltage dependence of activation, consistent with an -helix having one face on which mutations to alanine oppose activation. In contrast, mutations G1460A, F1462A, L1465A, N1466A, G1470A, and I1473A caused significant positive shifts (Fig. B, angular frequency of positive shifts in G0 determined for mutations of residues in the intracellular portion of IIIS6 between F1462A and I1473A (26, 36). In contrast, mutations I1473A and I1469A caused significant positive shifts in the voltage dependence of Role of Sodium Channel IIIS6 in Gating and Drug Block inactivation (Fig. The two mutations giving positive shifts (I1469A and I1473A) are four residues apart, and mutations F1463A, L1467A, and V1471A, which define local peaks in the negative shifts of inactivation, are also four residues apart in the sequence. Mutations F1462A, L1465A, N1466A, I1469A, and I1473A induced positive shifts of the voltage for half-maximal activation and positive G0 values (Figs.

Human WT CLC-Ka and CLC-Kb, and their mutants, were coexpressed with mutant Y98A of barttin, leading to an enhancement of expression (Estevez et al, 2001). Most mutants retained the gating properties of their respective parent channel with two notable exceptions: in the double mutant CLC-KaN68D/G72E gating relaxations were almost completely absent (Fig 5E) and the CLC-Kb mutant D68N showed a gating phenotype similar to that of CLC-Ka (Fig 5H). Whereas position 68 is important for sensitivity to both 3-phenyl-CPP and DIDS, two other residues specifically alter blockage by DIDS and 3-phenyl-CPP, respectively: CLC-KaG72E retains WT sensitivity to 3-phenyl-CPP but becomes insensitive to DIDS (Fig 5L). Not surprisingly, the double mutant CLC-KaN68D/G72E is similar to the single mutant CLC-KaN68D, being less sensitive to both compounds.

The Val1589Met mutant sodium channel identified in our patients has been expressed and studied in human embr yonic kidney (HEK293) cells, in which an instability of the inactivated state was shown.25 In view of the insignificant clinical response in our patient to oral potassium load, it is interesting that in these studies of the mutation in HEK293 cells, increasing the extracellular potassium concentration did not aVect the current recorded.25 These patients also exhibit variability of symptoms from day to day, which has previously been described as myotonia fluctuans.13 An unusual feature is the occurrence of painful cramps, as was the presenting feature in our proband. 
11259290	Rabbit and pig RyRs differ by one amino acid in the RyR sequence required for DHPR II-III loop binding with Thr1082Ala substitution in the pig (Fujii et al., 1991; Takeshima et al., 1989). A single amino acid substitution of Arg614 to Cys is responsible in 4% of MHsusceptible humans, and the same substitution at residue 615 of the RyR is found in all MH-susceptible pigs. Biophysical Journal Volume 80 April 2001 1769 1782 1769 Arg615Cys Substitution in Pig Skeletal Ryanodine Receptors Increases Activation of Single Channels by a Segment of the Skeletal DHPR II-III Loop Esther M. These results show that the Arg615Cys substitution in RyRMH has multiple effects on RyRs. Although the reduced Mg2 inhibition explains many of the effects of the Arg615Cys substitution on EC coupling, other aspects of RyRMH activity relevant to EC coupling have not been examined. The effect of the Arg615Cys substitution in RyRMH was to amplify these actions of the peptide, particularly the increase in the duration of channel opening. The Arg615Cys substitution could alter the conformation of the MH1 domain and its interaction with other regions of the RyR or allosterically alter the II-III loop binding site or the structure of regions critical for transmission of information from the DHPR binding region to the RyR ion channel pore. The enhanced inhibition of RyRMH could be due to a greater negative charge density in the channel vestibule as result of the Arg615Cys substitution. Peptide A-evoked Ca2 normal pig SR r elease from Multiple effects of the MH mutation In addition to effects of the MH mutation on activation and inhibition by peptide A, the Arg615Cys substitution is associated with a reduced affinity of RyRMH for Ca2 (Fill et al., Biophysical Journal 80(4) 1769 1782 The low Ca2 release from SRN induced by peptide A was unexpected, since EC coupling and contraction in pig muscle proceed as effectively as in rabbit muscle (Gallant et al., 1980).

Whereas L270V and I337V were without effect on the properties of reconstituted human SUR1/KIR6.2 channels (including expression rate, single channel conductance, spontaneous open probability [PO], and nucleotide and drug sensitivities [results not shown]), E23K markedly affected channel gating, significantly reducing the time spent in long interburst closed states (17 3% for SUR1/ the mutant isoform of KIR6.2 with K instead of E in position 23 [KIR6.2E23K] vs. The effect of E23K on the ICR2 value was not altered by additional introduction of L270V and/or I337V (Fig. C: The effect of E23K on ICR2 values was not altered by additional introduction of L270V and/or I337V into human KIR6.2. 51, MARCH 2002 Partial absence of coupling with E23K led to a lack of detectable association of homozygous I337V with type 2 diabetes (8), arguing against localization of the disease locus downstream (i.e., in the 3 direction) codon 337 of the KIR6.2 gene.

Whereas open time distributions did not differ significantly (TO 3.1 or 3.0 ms for wild-type and mutant channels, respectively), E23K induced a loss of the longer closed events (wild-type channels: TC1 0.47 ms, A1 83%, TC2 45 ms, and A2 17%; mutant channels: TC1 0.40 ms, A1 97%, TC2 6.7 ms, and A2 3%), where TO is the time constant of the open state; TC1, TC2, A1, and A2 are time constants or relative fractions of short (intraburst) or long (interburst) closed states, respectively.

Results indicate that E23K in KIR6.2 significantly affects properties of pancreatic -cell KATP channels, increasing spontaneous PO and reducing ATP sensitivity in models for the heterozygous (E/K) and homozygous (K/K) state (Figs. E23K increases the ATP concentration required to suppress PO to 0.02. A: ATP sensitivity of wild-type or mutant SUR1/KIR6.2 channels transiently expressed in COS-1 cells (1:1, cDNA ratio of KIR6.2wt and KIR6.2E23K; see also Fig. IC50 values in these registrations were 7.9 mol/l (wild type), 11.7 mol/l (1:1 ratio), and 24.6 mol/l (E23K). Results were normalized to spontaneous PO values determined in single-channel records (KIR6.2wt .41, KIR6.2E23K 0.66; see text). IC50 values for ATP and Hill coefficients were: 8.9 0.2 mol/l, 1.26 (KIR6.2wt, E); 12.4 0.3 mol/l, 1.25 (KIR6.2wt KIR6.2E23K, cDNA ratio of 1:1, f); and 19.7 0.5 mol/l, 1.28 (KIR6.2E23K, F).

This idea is strongly supported by recent reports that demonstrate that lowering ATP sensitivity by no more than 3.6-fold induces severe neonatal diabetes in transgenic mice (3), and that reveal clear association of homozygous E23K (K/K) with type 2 diabetes in Caucasians (overall 2 21.3 with 1 df, P 0.000004) (8,9). Particularly, the latter studies suggest that because of its high allelic prevalence (weighted averaged estimate in Caucasians 34%) (59), E23K is of considerable importance in the pathogenesis of common type 2 diabetes. Additional evidence in favor of E23K derives from reinterpretation of published association studies (5 8,14 16), as follows: DIABETES, VOL. 51, MARCH 2002 Partial absence of coupling with E23K led to a lack of detectable association of homozygous I337V with type 2 diabetes (8), arguing against localization of the disease locus downstream (i.e., in the 3 direction) codon 337 of the KIR6.2 gene. At 7.5 kb from the 5 end of the KIR6.2 gene, a common missense SNP in codon 1369 of the SUR1 gene was found to be in linkage disequilibrium with E23K in KIR6.2 ( 77%) (6). We conclude that E23K promotes development of type 2 diabetes by increasing the threshold ATP concentration, thus inducing overactivity of pancreatic -cell KATP channels and inhibiting insulin secretion. The conclusion that E23K may induce a discrete inhibition of insulin secretion is supported by a study in healthy young adults (7). Here, E23K was associated with either direct (slightly reduced glucose-stimulated release) or indirect (elevated insulin sensitivity or glucose effectiveness) (examples in 18,19) evidence for decreased secretion. High allelic frequency of E23K in Caucasians (see above) with similar values in all populations screened (59) suggests that E23K represents a balanced polymorphism, conferring selectionary advantage through finetuning of insulin secretion in heterozygotes. Notably, this model implies increased susceptibility to type 2 diabetes as an inherent price for the evolutionary benefit of the heterozygous state, and thus E23K provides evidence in support of the "thrifty genotype" hypothesis (20). Early studies (57) were unable to reveal the impact of E23K because they were not designed to detect a trait with a relative risk as low as 2, based on small quantitative changes of channel properties. The latter presumably prompted failure to detect relevance of the polymorphism because E23K affects neither maximal nucleoside diphosphate induced channel activation (i.e., metabolic inhibition through 3 mmol/l azide [5]) nor maximal ATP-mediated closure (i.e., millimoles per liter of resting ATP levels [5]) (Fig. A recent family-based study failed to replicate association between E23K and type 2 diabetes (21). The present report is the first to identify the subtle variation of KATP channel function that is induced by E23K in KIR6.2. In coexpression experiments (KIR6.2wt plus KIR6.2E23K with a cDNA ratio of 1:1) (Fig. The equivalent value for the 1:1 coexpression, PO-S(1:1), was approximated from the values obtained in patches with multiple channels as foll o w s : P O-S(1:1) P O-S(wt) [(PO-S(E23K) P O-S(wt)) (PO-M(1:1) P O-M(wt)) / (PO-M(E23K) PO-M(wt))], where PO-S(wt) and PO-S(E23K) are the PO estimates from single-channel registrations for pure wild-type (0.41) and E23K (0.66) channels, respectively, and PO-M(wt), PO-M(1:1), and PO-M(E23K) are the arithmetic means of corresponding values from noise analysis and determination of Imax (0.55, 0.64, and 0.81, respectively; see text). Three common missense single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been observed in KIR6.2 (E23K, L270V, and I337V) (59), and their potential impact in type 2 diabetes led us to analyze their functional relevance. Whereas L270V and I337V were without effect on the properties of reconstituted human SUR1/KIR6.2 channels (including expression rate, single channel conductance, spontaneous open probability [PO], and nucleotide and drug sensitivities [results not shown]), E23K markedly affected channel gating, significantly reducing the time spent in long interburst closed states (17 3% for SUR1/ the mutant isoform of KIR6.2 with K instead of E in position 23 [KIR6.2E23K] vs. The effect of E23K on the ICR2 value was not altered by additional introduction of L270V and/or I337V (Fig. C: The effect of E23K on ICR2 values was not altered by additional introduction of L270V and/or I337V into human KIR6.2.

Surprisingly, cysteine mutations within the pore region of the -subunit did not appreciably alter single channel Li conductance (Table I), with the exception of L591C. Substitution of cysteine residues within the amino-terminal portion of the pore region of mENaC a ( V569C to G579C) did not produce alterations of Li /Na nd K /Na current ratios, with the exception of S573C. Given their observations, it is somewhat surprising that we found Li /Na current ratio was observed only with the mutant S573C, and an altered (reduced) Ki for amiloride was observed with the mutant L575C. For example, we c observed a modest but significant reduction in the Li /Na urrent ratio with the S573C mutation. (13), although a mutation of the corresponding residue within human ENaC to alanine (C541A) resulted in no significant change in either Li /Na or K /Na selectivity (14). However, these changes in amiloride's Ki were modest, particularly when compared with the nearly 1000-fold increase in Ki observed with a single mutation within the pore region of the - or -subunit of mouse ( G525C and G542C) and rat ENaC ( G525C and G537C). Therefore, we examined whether substitution of the GSS tract (residues 587589) within mENaC with GYG ( S588Y, S589G) rendered the mutant channel K -selective (Table II and Fig. Removal of Ba2 from the bath solution had no effect on the amiloride-sensitive Na currents measured in , W582C , G587C , oocytes expressing wild type S589C , or the GYG mutant ( S588Y- S589G ).

However, retention of the hydroxyl moiety on the side chain at position -Ser589 ( S589T), or introduction of a hydroxyl moiety on the side chain at position -Gly587 ( G587S) allowed channels to discriminate Na from K .

Furthermore, our observation that the G587S mutation resulted in no significant change in cation selectivity is in agreement with the results of Kellenberger et al. Substitution of amino acid residues with hydroxyl groups (serine or threonine) at position -Gly587 or -Ser589 ( G587S and S589T) resulted in channels that retained wild type K / Na selectivity. Only one of the cysteine mutations ( L575C) within the amino-terminal portion of the pore region (residues -Val569 -Gly579) exhibited a Ki for amiloride (53 5 nM, n 4) that differed from wild type. Given their observations, it is somewhat surprising that we found Li /Na current ratio was observed only with the mutant S573C, and an altered (reduced) Ki for amiloride was observed with the mutant L575C. Substitution of cysteine residues within the amino-terminal portion of the pore region of mENaC a ( V569C to G579C) did not produce alterations of Li /Na nd K /Na current ratios, with the exception of S573C. In contrast, five mutations within the carboxyl-terminal portion of the pore domain ( S580C, W582C, L584C, F586C, and S592C) significantly altered the Li /Na current ratio (Figs.

Substitution of cysteine residues within the amino-terminal portion of the pore region of mENaC a ( V569C to G579C) did not produce alterations of Li /Na nd K /Na current ratios, with the exception of S573C. However, these changes in amiloride's Ki were modest, particularly when compared with the nearly 1000-fold increase in Ki observed with a single mutation within the pore region of the - or -subunit of mouse ( G525C and G542C) and rat ENaC ( G525C and G537C). To further explore the role of residues at positions -Gly587 and -Ser589 in determining cation selectivity, additional mutations were generated, including G587A, G587S, G587T, S589A, S589G, and S589T. However, retention of the hydroxyl moiety on the side chain at position -Ser589 ( S589T), or introduction of a hydroxyl moiety on the side chain at position -Gly587 ( G587S) allowed channels to discriminate Na from K . The K /Na current ratios for G587S and S589T were 0.03 0.03 (n 4) and 0.04 0.02 (n 5), respectively, and did not differ significantly from wild type (Table II and Fig. The mutants c S589A , S589T , and S589G expressed inward Na urrents that were greater than inward Li currents, with Li /Na current ratios of 0.88 0.39 (n 4), 0.86 0.21 (n 5 ), and 0.96 0.07 (n 6), respectively.

10423418	In the present study, we used both wild-type Rdl cDNA pNB14.1 (referred to here as RdlS) and cDNA carrying the A302S mutation responsible for cyclodiene resistance (referred to here as RdlR).

Reducing internal [KCl] to 20 mM moved the reversal potential of the N319RS channel to 43.7 mV (Fig. The reversal potential measurements for RdlS, RdlR, and N319RS indicated that PK/PCl ratios of these channels were all very small. For N319RS channels the value was 0.013, and for the two other channels the ratio was indistinguishable from zero. 6 shows the expected behavior of a channel permeable only to Cl ; the points for the two wild-type channels, RdlS and RdlR, and the mutant N319RS channel are very close to this line. Current-voltage plots were obtained from the N319RS (n 5) and N319KR (n 12) mutant S channels. (A) For the N319R mutant channels, the reversal potential was 43.7 mV. Reversal potentials and permeability ratios (PK/PCl) were obtained for the RdlS (OE; n 10), RdlR (; n 5), N319RS (F; n 5), and N319KR (f; for 20 mM KCl, n 12; for 60 mM KCl, n 9; for 140 mM KCl, n 10). 5, the reversal potentials were 43.7 mV for N319RS, 45.5 mV for RdlS, and 47.0 mV for RdlR (estimated by fitting 0urrent-voltage plots to the GHK current equation). These gave PK/PCl c .013 for N319RS and values indistinguishable from zero for RdlS and RdlR.

Note the rightward shift in reversal potential to 24.7 mV for the N319KR mutant channel in B (see also Fig. However, this mutation also removed the rectification to produce linear current-voltage plots with conductances of 23.6 0.8 pS for N319KS (n 9) and 20.9 0.4 pS for N319KR (n 14). Thus the loss of rectification in N319K channels cannot be explained as a consequence of charge. Even though ( these recordings were made in essentially symmetrical Cl 140 mM internal [Cl ] and 141.6 mM external [Cl ]), the reversal potentials were 15.9 2.5 mV (n 9) for N319KS (Fig. 2 D) and 24.7 2.3 mV (n 12) for N319KR (Fig. Note that a negative single-channel current was seen at 10 mV for the N319KR channel, indicating that it reverses well above zero. Furthermore, when a voltage ramp was applied, the open channel current of N319KR reversed at 23.7 mV. Cation Permeability in a Mutant GABA-Gated Chloride Channel 695 Cation permeation of N319K channels Cation permeability was the most likely explanation for the positive reversal potential of the two N319K mutants shown in Figs. We therefore tested the effects of changes in cations, and because the reversal potential shift was greater in N319KR compared to N319KS, we used the N319KR mutant channel (lysine replacement at residue 319 on a cyclodiene-resistant background) for further study. Under these essentially symmetrical conditions the current-voltage plot for the N319KR mutant channel reversed near zero (1.9 0.4 mV, n 10) (Fig. FIGURE 4 Effects of cation asymmetry on the reversal potentials of N319KR mutant channels. 4 shows that the reversal potential of the N319KR mutant channel is sensitive to the distribution of cations between the external and internal solutions, thus indicating that the N319KR mutant channel is cation permeable. To quantify the cation permeability in the N319KR mutant channel, we determined the permeability ratio of K to Cl by holding external [KCl] fixed, while varying internal [KCl] and maintaining osmolarity with sucrose. For the same solutions, the N319KR channel reversed at 20.2 mV (Fig. For the N319KR channel, the plot of reversal potential versus pipette KCl activity obeyed the GHK voltage equation, with PK/PCl 0.33 (Fig. Current-voltage plots were obtained from the N319RS (n 5) and N319KR (n 12) mutant S channels. (B) For the N319KR mutant channel, the reversal potential obtained by linear fit was 20.2 8.3 mV, giving PK/PCl 0.34. Reversal potentials and permeability ratios (PK/PCl) were obtained for the RdlS (OE; n 10), RdlR (; n 5), N319RS (F; n 5), and N319KR (f; for 20 mM KCl, n 12; for 60 mM KCl, n 9; for 140 mM KCl, n 10). The reversal potentials for N319KR were obtained from current-voltage plots by linear fitting. For the N319KR mutant channels, fitting the plot of reversal potential versus KCl activity to the GHK voltage equation (see Materials and Methods) gave PK/PCl 0.33 ( ). The similar conductances in solu- FIGURE 7 Effects of large organic cations and anions on the conductance and reversal potential of the N319KR mutant channel. 4, cations permeate the N319KR channel but carry little if any current. 8 for RdlS, RdlR, and N319KR. The reversal potentials were 78.6 6.0 mV for RdlS (n 5), 76.0 2.9 mV for RdlR (n 8), and 68.2 2.2 mV for the N319KR mutant (n 8). The value for N319KR was significantly different from that for RdlR (p 0.05), but not from that for RdlS (p 0.08). From these reversal potentials we obtained PAc/PCl values of 0.049 for RdlS, 0.047 for RdlR, and 0.064 for N319KR. The permeability ratios were determined for formate and propionate as well (in RdlR and N319KR), and the values are plotted versus the Stokes diameter (Fig. Although these models failed to account quantitatively for the size dependence, the fits gave pore sizes in the 5 6 range, and the pore size of N319KR was 0.3 larger in each case. Current-voltage plots in RdlS (A), RdlR (B), and N319KR mutant (C) channels. The physical significance of such a dependence is not clear, other than possibly as a Boltzmann term with a size-dependent energy 698 Biophysical Journal Volume 77 August 1999 pS (n 4) for RdlR and 2.8 0.4 pS (n 3) for N319KR. However, the conductance was also reduced for current carried by Cl in the opposite direction (11.2 0.7 pS for N319KR, n 11; and 7.0 0.5 pS for RdlR, n 7), and this is yet another result that suggests interactions between ion fluxes. The lysine-substituted mutant channels, N319KS and N319KR are permeable to cations. The possible permeation of the N319KR channel by multiion complexes FIGURE 9 Plot of permeability ratio versus Stokes diameter. Squares are for N319KR and circles are for RdlR. The best fitting exponential functions are drawn through the data points and suggest that the N319KR channel has a pore that is 0.2 larger than the pore of the RdlR channel (see text). The plot for N319KR and the best fitting exponential functions are shifted to the right by 0.2 relative to the plot for RdlR. This view is underscored by the comparison of conductances between RdlR and N319KR in acetate. The conductance for inward current (carried by acetate) in the N319KR channel is lower than that in the RdlR channel, but the permeability ratio for acetate to Cl in the N319KR channel is higher. In this way the amino acid in the distant residue 302 (the site that determines cyclodiene sensitivity) could change its position to allow the N319K mutation to have different consequences in the cyclodiene-resistant and -sensitive backgrounds, as observed (Fig. The hippocampal chloride channel and multiion permeation Some of the permeation properties of the N319KR channel described here resemble those of a rat hippocampal voltagedependent Cl channel, studied in detail by Franciolini and Nonner (1987, 1994a,b). We also note two differences: 1) The N319KR channel shows a strong preference for Na over K , but the hippocampal Cl channel has equal permeabilities for these two cations. 2) The hippocampal Cl channel has higher permeability for the organic anion acetate (PAc/PCl 0.66) than the N319KR channel (PAc/PCl 0.064), implying that the hippocampal Cl channel has a larger pore diameter. Thus it is possible that some of the results seen in the N319KR channel can be explained by a similar mechanism. If some GABAA receptor variants have channels that allow ions to permeate by a mechanism similar to that found for the N319KR channel, then the Na and K gradients of a cell would lead to reversal potentials that are positive relative to the Nernst potential for Cl . This provides a new hypothesis for the diversity of neuronal 700 Biophysical Journal Volume 77 August 1999 responses to GABA, namely that a GABAA receptor has Rdl N319K-like behavior, so that its reversal potential is determined by cations as well as anions.

Mutations L1465A and I1469A also reduced the inactivated-state affinity for the anticonvulsant lamotrigine and its congeners (30). Mutations of residues at positions 13 (L975A in segment IIS6 and V1768A in segment IVS6), 14 (N418A in segment IS6 and N1769A in segment IVS6), and 17 (I1469A in segment IIIS6 and I1772A in segment IVS6) (Fig. segment IS6, N1466A in segment IIIS6, and N1769A in segment IVS6), 15 (L1467A in segment IIIS6), and 17 (L421C in segment IS6 and I1772A in segment IVS6) also significantly decreased the steepness of the voltage dependence of the activation process (Fig. Steady-state inactivation curves for wild-type (q), L416A (E), L421C (), V424A (), M967A (f), V974A ( ), and L983A ( ) channels are shown. For example, mutations L416A, L421C, and L983A shifted the voltage for half-maximal inactivation positively by 8, 5, and 3 mV, respectively (Fig. Significant positive shifts were also caused by mutations F405A, L411A, Y415A, N418A, and V966A (see Fig. Seven alanine mutants in segment IS6 (V408A, S413A, F414A, I417A, I420A, L421A, and V423A) and five alanine mutants in segment IIS6 (V968A, L977A, L979A, L981A, and L982A) did not express sufficient Na currents for analysis (generally 0.1 A). Mutations of residues at positions 13 (L975A in segment IIS6 and V1768A in segment IVS6), 14 (N418A in segment IS6 and N1769A in segment IVS6), and 17 (I1469A in segment IIIS6 and I1772A in segment IVS6) (Fig. q, WT channel; E, Y415A; , M967A; , N971A; f, M974A. In contrast, mutations V424A in IS6 and L983A in IIS6 caused strong negative shifts. Conductance-voltage curves for wild-type (q), N418A (E), V424A (), L975A (), and L983A (f) channels are shown.

Significant positive shifts were also caused by mutations F405A, L411A, Y415A, N418A, and V966A (see Fig. Mutations Y415A, M967A, N971A, and V974A significantly increased resting block by etidocaine at a holding potential of 90 mV by 3-, 2-, 6-, and 2-fold, respectively (p 0.01) (Fig. Mutation Y415A shifted the voltage dependence of inactivation positively by 4 mV, so it opposed inactivation rather than enhancing it; and mutation N971A did not have any effect on the inactivation (see Fig. q, WT channel; E, Y415A; , M967A; , N971A; f, M974A. In contrast, the resting affinities of Y415A and N971A decreased little with further hyperpolarization from 90 mV, and resting affinities for etidocaine were 3-fold greater than that of the WT channel at 120 mV (p 0.01) (Fig. Seven alanine mutants in segment IS6 (V408A, S413A, F414A, I417A, I420A, L421A, and V423A) and five alanine mutants in segment IIS6 (V968A, L977A, L979A, L981A, and L982A) did not express sufficient Na currents for analysis (generally 0.1 A).

Mutations N418A and L975A shifted the voltage for half-maximal activation positively by 21 and 17 mV, respectively (Fig. For L975A, activation was shifted positively by 17 mV, so the test pulse was 20 mV.

Seven alanine mutants in segment IS6 (V408A, S413A, F414A, I417A, I420A, L421A, and V423A) and five alanine mutants in segment IIS6 (V968A, L977A, L979A, L981A, and L982A) did not express sufficient Na currents for analysis (generally 0.1 A). Significant positive shifts were also caused by mutations F405A, L411A, Y415A, N418A, and V966A (see Fig. Seven alanine mutants in segment IS6 (V408A, S413A, F414A, I417A, I420A, L421A, and V423A) and five alanine mutants in segment IIS6 (V968A, L977A, L979A, L981A, and L982A) did not express sufficient Na currents for analysis (generally 0.1 A). Mutations Y415A, M967A, N971A, and V974A significantly increased resting block by etidocaine at a holding potential of 90 mV by 3-, 2-, 6-, and 2-fold, respectively (p 0.01) (Fig. Mutation Y415A shifted the voltage dependence of inactivation positively by 4 mV, so it opposed inactivation rather than enhancing it; and mutation N971A did not have any effect on the inactivation (see Fig. q, WT channel; E, Y415A; , M967A; , N971A; f, M974A. In contrast, the resting affinities of Y415A and N971A decreased little with further hyperpolarization from 90 mV, and resting affinities for etidocaine were 3-fold greater than that of the WT channel at 120 mV (p 0.01) (Fig. Mutations F1764A and Y1771A in segment IVS6 of the rat brain Nav1.2 channel reduced the affinity of inactivated Na channels for the local anesthetic etidocaine by 130- and 35-fold, respectively (29).

Mutations L421C and L983A near the intracellular ends of IS6 and IIS6, respectively, exhibited significant sustained Na currents at the end of 30-ms depolarizations, indicating a role for these residues in Na channel fast inactivation. Steady-state inactivation curves for wild-type (q), L416A (E), L421C (), V424A (), M967A (f), V974A ( ), and L983A ( ) channels are shown. when substituted with alanine, only L421C expressed sufficient Na current for analysis when mutated to cysteine. The slope factor of the voltage dependence of the activation was significantly less steep for N418A (k 8.0 0.2 mV) and L421C (k 7.6 0.4 mV) compared with the wild-type channel (k 5.8 0.2 mV). For example, mutations L416A, L421C, and L983A shifted the voltage for half-maximal inactivation positively by 8, 5, and 3 mV, respectively (Fig. The steady-state inactivation curve for L421C and L983A approached nonzero asymptotes with strong depolarizations (Fig. This residual, non-inactivating component of the Na current was 6% for L421C and 7% for L983A.

B, fraction of current that failed to inactivate for wild-type, L421C, and L983A channels. Mutations L421C in segment IS6 and L983A in segment IIS6 exhibited non-inactivating currents, which were 10 and 16% of the peak current, respectively (Fig. Significant sustained currents produced by mutations L421C and L983A suggest that these two residues might interact either directly or allosterically with the inactivation gate of the Na channel, which is formed by the intracellular loop between domains III and IV. segment IS6, N1466A in segment IIIS6, and N1769A in segment IVS6), 15 (L1467A in segment IIIS6), and 17 (L421C in segment IS6 and I1772A in segment IVS6) also significantly decreased the steepness of the voltage dependence of the activation process (Fig. Our present results for transmembrane segments IS6 and IIS6 demonstrate that mutations L421C in segment IS6 and L983A in segment IIS6 disrupted inactivation from the open state and caused non-inactivating Na currents. Mutations of residues at positions 13 (L975A in segment IIS6 and V1768A in segment IVS6), 14 (N418A in segment IS6 and N1769A in segment IVS6), and 17 (I1469A in segment IIIS6 and I1772A in segment IVS6) (Fig. segment IS6, N1466A in segment IIIS6, and N1769A in segment IVS6), 15 (L1467A in segment IIIS6), and 17 (L421C in segment IS6 and I1772A in segment IVS6) also significantly decreased the steepness of the voltage dependence of the activation process (Fig. Catterall From the Department of Pharmacology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195-7280 Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of transmembrane segm s ents IS6 and IIS6 of the rat brain Nav1.2 channel ubunit identified mutations N418A in IS6 and L975A in IIS6 as causing strong positive shifts in the voltage dependence of activation. Mutation I409A in IS6 reduced the affinity of the local anesthetic etidocaine for the inactivated state by 6-fold, and mutations I409A and N418A reduced use-dependent block by etidocaine. Conductance-voltage curves for wild-type (q), N418A (E), V424A (), L975A (), and L983A (f) channels are shown. Mutations N418A and L975A shifted the voltage for half-maximal activation positively by 21 and 17 mV, respectively (Fig. The slope factor of the voltage dependence of the activation was significantly less steep for N418A (k 8.0 0.2 mV) and L421C (k 7.6 0.4 mV) compared with the wild-type channel (k 5.8 0.2 mV). Significant positive shifts were also caused by mutations F405A, L411A, Y415A, N418A, and V966A (see Fig. Likewise, mutations I409A, F410A, N418A, V424A, F978A, and L983A did not significantly affect the affinity of inactivated channels for the anticonvulsant lamotrigine. For N418A, activation was shifted positively by 21 mV, and the slope factor of the activation process was less steep, so a test pulse of 40 mV was used. For N418A, activation was shifted positively by 21 mV, and channels activated less steeply with voltage. Mutation I409A significantly reduced frequency-dependent block by etidocaine, and frequencydependent block was almost completely abolished by mutation N418A (Fig. C Effect of Mutations I409A and N418A on Recovery of Na hannels from Inactivated-state Etidocaine Block--We studied recovery of etidocaine-blocked inactivated Na channels to the resting state for mutations I409A and N418A, which signific cantly affected voltage- and frequency-dependent block of Na hannels by etidocaine. We measured the rate of recovery by applying a 500-ms conditioning prepulse to 0 mV (to 40 mV for N418A; see above) to produce drug block of inactivated channels, followed by a recovery interval of variable duration and a test pulse to 0 mV (to 40 mV for N418A). For N418A, activation was shifted positively by 21 mV, and the slope factor of the activation process was less steep. contrast, N418A recovered with fast 1.2 0.2 ms or 4-fold faster than the wild-type channels and with slow 337 28 ms or at least 2.5-fold slower than the wild-type channels (Fig. This time constant is a minimum estimate because only 80% of the N418A current had recovered after 4 s (Fig. These data indicate that mutation N418A is characterized by a slow inactivated state with far slower recovery kinetics than the WT channel. In contrast, N418A recovered with drug 0.32 .03 s (p 0.01) (Fig. Furthermore, in the presence of 100 M etidocaine, N418A reached 100% recovery after 2 s (Fig. 7C), whereas the control N418A channel had only recovered to 70% of its initial level by 4 s (Fig. The faster recovery compared with the WT channel recovery suggests a lower affinity of the closed inactivated N418A channel for etidocaine compared with the affinity of the WT channels. This faster dissociation of etidocaine from N418A contributes to the reduction in frequency-dependent block of this mutant by etidocaine (Fig. AC, representative time courses of Na channel recovery from inactivation under control conditions (q) and in the presence of 100 M etidocaine (E) for wild-type (A), I409A (B), and N418A (C) channels. Recovery was measured using a 500-ms conditioning pulse to 0 mV (to 40 mV for N418A), followed by a recovery interval of the indicated duration (1.5 4000 ms) at 90 mV, followed by a test pulse to 0 mV (to 40 mV for N418A).

Mutation I409A caused the largest decrease in affinity for etidocaine of all studied mutations (6-fold increase in KI; p 0.01) (Fig. Likewise, mutations I409A, F410A, N418A, V424A, F978A, and L983A did not significantly affect the affinity of inactivated channels for the anticonvulsant lamotrigine.

I409A recovered with fast 4.5 0.2 ms and slow 143 12 ms (Fig. For I409A, drug was 1.7 0.1 s, not significantly different from the drug for the wild-type channels (p 0.05) (F 0 ig. In contrast, the reduction in frequency-dependent block of I409A must be primarily caused by the reduced affinity of this mutant for etidocaine because the mutation has no effect on recovery from etidocaine block.

In contrast, mutations V424A in IS6 and L983A in IIS6 caused strong negative shifts. Mutations L421C and L983A near the intracellular ends of IS6 and IIS6, respectively, exhibited significant sustained Na currents at the end of 30-ms depolarizations, indicating a role for these residues in Na channel fast inactivation.

9734479	A point mutation (W to F) was introduced at position 362 in the pore region of Kv4.2 to produce a nonconducting mutant (Kv4.2W362F) subunit. Coexpression of Kv4.2W362F with Kv4.2 (or Kv4.3) attenuates the wild-type currents, and the effect is subfamily specific; ie, Kv4.2W362F does not affect heterologously expressed Kv1.4 currents. With the use of the -myosin heavy chain promoter to direct cardiac-specific expression, several lines of Kv4.2W362F transgenic mice were generated. Electrophysiological recordings reveal that Ito is selectively eliminated in ventricular myocytes isolated from transgenic mice expressing Kv4.2W362F, thereby demonstrating directly that the Kv 4 subfamily underlies Ito in the mammalian heart. In addition, a novel rapidly activating and inactivating K urrent, which is not detectable in myocytes from nontransgenic littermates, is evident in Kv4.2W362F-expressing ventricular cells. To achieve this, a point mutation was introduced in the pore region of Kv4.2 to produce a subunit (Kv4.2W362F) that functions as a dominant negative.21,22 Transgenic mice expressing Kv4.2 driven by the -myosin heavy chain promoter 2326 were then generated and characterized. Electrophysiological studies reveal that Ito is selectively eliminated in ventricular myocytes isolated from Kv4.2W362Fexpressing mice, demonstrating that the Kv4 subfamily underlies Ito in the mammalian heart. Materials and Methods Construction of the Epitope-Tagged Dominant-Negative Kv4.2, Kv4.2W362F-FLAG Inverse polymerase chain reaction was used to introduce mutations in the DNA sequence encoding the pore region of Kv4.2; pRc/CMV- Received April 20, 1998; accepted July 17, 1998. The mutations had 2 functions: (1) to introduce the SacII restriction enzyme site (without altering the amino acid sequence) and (2) to alter the amino acid sequence at position 362 in the pore region from W (tryptophan [W]) YT to F (phenylalanine [F]) YT (designated W362F). In addition, the stop codon was removed, and Kv4.2W362F was tagged at the C terminus with the 8 amino acid FLAG epitope. Generation of Transgenic Mice Expressing -MHCKv4.2W362F-FLAG The Kv4.2W362F-FLAG coding sequence was subcloned into the -myosin heavy chain ( -MHC) vector2326 at the SalI site. The -MHCKv4.2W362F plasmid was digested to isolate a 7-kb fragment that included the -MHC promoter, the first 3 noncoding exons of the -MHC gene, the Kv4.2W362F-FLAG coding sequence, and the human growth hormone (HGH) polyadenylation signal sequences.2326 After purification, this fragment was resuspended in 100 L of 10 mmol/L Tris buffer containing 10 mmol/L NaCl and 0.1 mmol/L EDTA at pH 7.4 and dialyzed against a 0.1- m Millipore filter. Cell Lines and Transient Transfections QT-6 cells (a quail fibroblast cell line), originally obtained from the laboratory of Dr John Merlie (Washington University Medical School, St Louis, Mo) and maintained as described previously,14 were transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate method14 with plasmids encoding Kv4.2, Kv4.3, or Kv4.2W362F together with green fluorescent protein (pGREENLANTERN, GIBCO BRL) to allow transfected cells to be identified before electrophysiological recordings. Electrocardiograms Surface ECGs were recorded from adult wild-type and Kv4.2W362F-expressing mice by using methods similar to those previously described.27 Briefly, mice were lightly anesthetized with 3% halothane (97% O2), and needle electrodes were placed on the limbs under the skin. Expression of Kv4.2W362F in Transgenic Mice Ventricular myocytes were isolated from adult transgenic and wild-type mice by use of a protocol similar to one previously described for isolation of rat cardiocytes.16 To assay FLAG expression, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 mol/L PBS at pH 7.4 for 1 hour. The whole-cell membrane capacitances of cells isolated from wild-type and transgenic animals were indistinguishable, with mean SEM values of 140 8 pF (n 20) and 152 9 pF (n 35) in wild-type and Kv4.2W362F-expressing cells, respectively. The input resistances of adult mouse wild-type (n 15) and Kv4.2W362F-expressing (n 22) ventricular myocytes were also indistinguishable, with mean SEM values of 1.33 0.22 G and 1.47 0.30 G , respectively. The time constants of inactivation of the depolarization-activated outward K currents in wild-type and Kv4.2W362F-expressing ventricular myocytes were determined from double-exponential fits to the decay phases of the current, using the following equation: At A1 exp( t/ 1) A2 exp( t/ 2) Ass, where At is the amplitude of the current at time, t; A1, 1, A2, and 2 represent the amplitudes (A) and the time constants ( ) of the fast (subscript 1) and slow (subscript 2) components of current decay; and Ass is the amplitude of the noninactivating component of the total outward K current. Differences between wild-type and Kv4.2W362F-expressing myocytes were analyzed using ANOVA and the Student t test; P values are presented in the text. Results Generation and Characterization of the Dominant-Negative Kv4.2 Construct, Kv4.2W362F To generate the Kv4 dominant-negative construct, mutations were introduced to the cDNA sequence to change the tryptophan (W) residue at position 362 in the pore region of Kv4.2 to phenylalanine (F). The dominant-negative Kv4 construct is referred to as Kv4.2W362F (Figure 1a). When transiently transfected into QT-6 cells, expression of Kv4.2W362F was readily detected immunohistochemically Figure 1. Kv4.2W362F functions as a dominant-negative subunit. No outward K currents are recorded from QT-6 cells expressing Kv4.2W362F (b). Coexpression of Kv4.2W362F with the wild-type Kv4 subunits, Kv4.2 (d) or Kv4.3 (f), however, markedly reduces (d, Kv4.2) or abolishes (f, Kv4.3) the outward K currents seen on expression of Kv4.2 (c) or Kv4.3 (e) alone. The currents recorded in QT-6 cells cotransfected with Kv1.4 and Kv4.2W362F (h) are indistinguishable from those recorded from cells expressing Kv1.4 alone (g). In whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from Kv4.2W362F-FLAG expressing QT-6 cells, however, no outward K currents were recorded (Figure 1b), suggesting that the mutant Kv4 subunit forms channels that are nonconducting. Furthermore, when equal amounts of the plasmids encoding wild-type Kv4.2 and Kv4.2W362F-FLAG were cotransfected into QT-6 cells, the densities of the Kv4.2-induced currents are markedly reduced (Figure 1d) compared with cells expressing wild-type Kv4.2 alone (Figure 1c). The mean SEM peak outward K current densities at 50 mV in QT-6 expressing wild-type Kv4.2 alone or wild-type Kv4.2 plus Kv4.2W362F were 454 36 pA/pF (n 10) and 87 16 pA/pF (n 10), respectively; these values are significantly (at the P 0.001 level) different. However, Barry et al the voltage dependences and the rates of activation and inactivation of the Kv4.2-induced currents in the absence and in the presence of Kv4.2W362F are indistinguishable (n 10), indicating that assembly of wild-type subunits with Kv4.2W362F leads to nonfunctional channels rather than to channels with altered time- and/or voltage-dependent properties; ie, Kv4.2W362F functions as a dominant negative.21,22 Coexpression of Kv4.2W362F with another member of the Kv4 subfamily, Kv4.3, also attenuates the K currents (Figure 1f) produced on expression of Kv4.3 alone (Figure 1e). The mean SEM peak outward K current density at 50 mV in QT-6 expressing wild-type Kv4.3 was 351 76 pA/pF (n 10), and no outward K currents were recorded from cells coexpressing wild-type Kv4.3 and Kv4.2W362F. However, coexpression of Kv4.2W362F with Kv1.4, a member of the Shaker subfamily that is not expected to assemble with subunits of the Kv4 subfamily,29 has no measurable effect on Kv1.4 currents (Figure 1g and 1h). The mean SEM peak outward K current densities at 50 mV in QT-6 expressing Kv1.4 alone or Kv1.4 plus Kv4.2W362F were 476 75 pA/pF (n 9) and 432 79 pA/pF (n 9), respectively; these values are not significantly different. September 7, 1998 563 Generation and Characterization of Transgenic Mice Expressing Kv4.2W362F The FLAG-tagged Kv4.2W362F DNA sequence was subcloned (see Materials and Methods) downstream from the cardiac-specific -MHC promoter in the -MHC expression vector (generously provided to us by Dr Jeffery Robbins, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio). Previous work has documented that this promoter is cardiac specific and that constitutive expression of the -MHC protein, as well as transgenes driven by this promoter, are detected in atria and ventricles from the time of birth.2326 A 7-kb fragment containing the -MHC promoter, the Kv4.2W362F-FLAG sequence, and the HGH polyadenylation signal sequence was isolated and injected into fertilized mouse oocytes (see Materials and Methods). 15, 25, and 27) were identified (data not shown) and were bred to wild-type C57CBA mice to generate 3 lines of Kv4.2W362F-FLAG expressing transgenic mice. Initial analysis of the functional consequences of Kv4.2W362F expression were completed on the F1 progeny of founder No. As illustrated in Figure 2a, Kv4.3W362F-FLAG protein expression was readily detected in Western blots of fractionated mouse ventricular membrane proteins prepared from line 25 transgenic animals (Figure 2a, arrow), whereas nothing is detected in immunoblots of ventricular membrane proteins prepared from wild-type littermates. On gross examination, there are no obvious differences between the Kv4.2W362F-expressing transgenic animals and Figure 2. Kv4.2W362F-FLAG is readily detected in ventricular myocytes of transgenic animals. A prominent band, corresponding to Kv4.2W362F-FLAG, is readily detected in membrane proteins prepared from T ventricles (arrow), whereas Kv4.2W362F-FLAG is not detected in immunoblots of fractionated WT ventricular membrane proteins. The FLAG epitope is readily detected in the myocytes isolated from Kv4.2W362F-expressing animals (c), whereas no staining was apparent in WT cells (e). Mean SEM body weights, for example, were 25.1 4.4 g (n 5) and 26.3 2.5 g (n 10) for 8-week (adult) wild-type and Kv4.2W362F-expressing animals; these values are not significantly different. Heart weights were also not significantly different, with mean SEM values of 98 9 mg (n 5) and 102 7 mg (n 10) for wild-type and Kv4.2W362F-expressing animals, respectively. Heart weightto body weight ratios in nontransgenic and transgenic animals were also very similar, and histological examination of hearts from Kv4.2W362Fexpressing animals revealed no significant differences from control hearts. In addition, the input resistances and wholecell membrane capacitances of ventricular myocytes isolated from Kv4.2W362F-expressing and wild-type animals are indistinguishable (see Materials and Methods). Outward K Currents Are Altered in Kv4.2W362F-Expressing Ventricular Myocytes Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings, however, revealed marked differences in the waveforms of the depolarizationactivated outward K currents in ventricular myocytes isolated from wild-type and transgenic littermates (Figure 3). Similar results were obtained in 40 myocytes from 2 Kv4.2W362F-FLAG transgenic animals derived from line 25, and the mean SEM peak outward densities at 20 mV were 37.1 2.5 pA/pF (n 39) and 16.1 1.0 pA/pF (n 40) in wild-type and Kv4.2W362Fexpressing myocytes, respectively; these values are significantly (at the P 0.001 level) different. In contrast, action potential amplitudes and resting membrane potentials of the Kv4.2W362F-expressing myocytes are not significantly different from those measured in wild-type cells. To determine the functional consequences of the marked prolongation of ventricular action potentials, surface ECGs were recorded from Kv4.2W362F-expressing transgenic and nontransgenic littermates (Figure 5). Neither heart rates (RR intervals) nor QRS durations, however, were affected by Kv4.2W362F expression. Mean SEM RR intervals were 193 19 ms (n 5) and 250 23 ms (n 12) in wild-type and Kv4.2W362F-expressing animals, respectively, and mean SEM QRS durations were 10.8 0.4 ms (n 5) and 11.2 0.2 ms (n 12) in control and transgenic animals, respectively. Functional consequences of Kv4.2W362F expression in transgenic mice. The waveforms of the Ca2 independent depolarization-activated outward K currents in wild-type (a and c) and transgenic (b and d) myocytes are distinct: the amplitudes and the rates of decay of the peak outward K currents recorded from ventricular myocytes isolated from Kv4.2W362F-expressing animals (b and d) are reduced compared with those (a and c) recorded from nontransgenic, ie, wild-type, cells. e and f, Current-clamp recordings reveal marked action potential prolongation in Kv4.2W362F-expressing ventricular myocytes (f) compared with ventricular myocytes isolated from nontransgenic littermates (e). Upregulation of a Novel Current in Kv4.2W362F-Expressing Ventricular Myocytes As is evident in Figure 3, the waveforms of the depolarization-activated K currents in ventricular myocytes isolated from wild-type and Kv4.2W362F-expressing littermates are distinct. Specifically, the fast component of inactivation (attributed to Ito30) appears to be markedly reduced or eliminated in the Kv4.2W362F-expressing cells (Figure 3b and 3d). The decay phases of the currents in Kv4.2W362Fexpressing myocytes were also well described by the sum of 2 exponentials. Similar results have been obtained in voltage-clamp experiments completed on ventricular myocytes isolated from progeny of transgenic founders 15 and 27; ie, Ito is also functionally marked reductions in peak outward K current densities in ventricular myocytes isolated from the Kv4.2W362Fexpressing transgenic animals, no measurable effects on the densities of either the plateau outward K currents, determined as the currents remaining at the end of 3-s voltage steps, or of the hyperpolarization-activated inwardly rectifying K current, IK1, were observed. Mean SEM plateau outward current densities at 20 mV, for example, were 3.5 0.4 pA/pF (n 18) and 3.7 0.2 pA/pF (n 18) in wildtype and Kv4.2W362F-expressing myocytes, respectively (Figure 4a). Mean SEM peak IK1 densities evoked at 120 mV from a holding potential of 70 mV in wild-type and Kv4.2W362F-expressing myocytes were 11 0.5 pA/pF (n 19) and 12 0.5 pA/pF (n 18), respectively (Figure 4a). Action Potentials and QT Intervals Are Prolonged in Kv4.2W362F-Expressing Animals In current-clamp experiments, action potentials recorded from Kv4.2W362F-expressing isolated ventricular myocytes (Figure 3f) are substantially broader than action potentials recorded from cells isolated from nontransgenic littermates (Figure 3e), consistent with the elimination of Ito. Analysis of action potential durations at 90% repolarization revealed mean SEM values of 36 10 ms (n 9) and 116 14 ms (n 9) in wild-type and Kv4.2W362F-expressing cells, re- Barry et al September 7, 1998 565 Figure 4. The densities and the decay rates of the peak outward K currents are altered in ventricular myocytes expressing Kv4.2W362F. a, Mean SEM K current densities in nontransgenic and Kv4.2W362F-expressing ventricular myocytes are illustrated. Only peak outward K current density is attenuated in Kv4.2W362F-expressing cells. The time constants of inactivation for the fast component of peak outward current decay, however, are significantly different at all test potentials, whereas there are no significant differences in the time constants of inactivation of the slow component of peak outward decay when the values obtained in nontransgenic and Kv4.2W362Fexpressing myocytes are compared (see text). The mean SEM time constants of inactivation of the slower components of current decay are not significantly different, suggesting that the slow components of current decay in wild-type ( decay, 956 45 ms) and Kv4.2W362F-expressing ( decay, 1145 85 ms) ventricular myocytes are the same. Interestingly, this slowly inactivating K current is selectively attenuated in transgenic mice28 expressing a dominant-negative Kv1.1 construct, Kv1.1N206Tag.31 Inactivation of the fast component of peak outward current decay (mean SEM decay, 212 19 ms) in Kv4.2W362Fexpressing ventricular myocytes is significantly (P 0.001) slower than Ito ( decay, 70 ms) at all test potentials (Figure 4b). Because the experiments on QT-6 cells (Figure 1) revealed that coexpression of the Kv4.2W362F with wildtype Kv4 subunits reduces K current amplitudes/densities without changing the kinetic properties of the currents, it seems unlikely that the fast component of current decay in Kv4.2W362F-expressing ventricular myocytes reflects (modified) Ito. In Kv4.2W362Fexpressing ventricular myocytes, however, the novel current contributes 50% to the peak outward current, with a mean SEM density of 8.3 0.6 pA/pF (n 10). Thus, even if expressed in wild-type myocytes, the results demonstrate that the novel current is markedly upregulated in Kv4.2W362Fexpressing myocytes. More important, however, is the fact that the quality of the fits to the decay phases of the currents 566 Kv4 Subunits Underlie Ito stimulation) that result in sustained arrhythmias in Kv4.2W362F-expressing animals/hearts are certainly warranted. As noted above, however, the Kv4.2W362F-expressing animals do not have spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias. In addition, it is of interest to note that the increases in action potential durations observed in Kv4.2W362F-expressing ventricular myocytes and the QT prolongation in Kv4.2W362F-expressing animals are both larger those seen in the Kv1.1N206Tag-expressing transgenics.28 Taken together, these results suggest that factors in addition to prolonged ventricular repolarization play an important role in determining the propensity to develop and to sustain arrhythmias. Clearly, studies focused on exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying the markedly different phenotypes of Kv4.2W362F- and Kv1.1N206Tag-expressing mice are warranted. Prolongation of the QT interval is evident in ECG recordings from Kv4.2W362F-expressing mice. P waves and QRS and QT intervals are clearly labeled in the records obtained from the nontransgenic (a) and Kv4.2W362F-expressing (b) mice; the scale bar is 100 ms. Upregulation of a Novel Current in Kv4.2W362F-Expressing Ventricular Myocytes In addition to providing a direct link between Ito and the Kv4 subunits, the results of the present study subfamily of demonstrate that a novel, rapidly activating, slowly inactivating current component is revealed when functional Ito channels are eliminated. With the use of the Kv4.2W362Fexpressing transgenic mice, it will now be possible to begin to explore the molecular mechanism(s) underlying functional electrical remodeling of the heart and to determine whether remodeling is dependent on changes in the expression of specific ion channels (Ito) and/or specific alterations in cardiac electrical activity. Ongoing experiments are aimed at determining the detailed time- and voltage-dependent properties, as well as the pharmacological sensitivity, of the current that is upregulated in the Kv4.2W362F-expressing animals. Ex- Discussion Functional Consequences of Cardiac-Specific Expression of Kv4.2W362F The results presented here reveal that Ito is functionally eliminated in myocytes isolated from Kv4.2W362Fexpressing animals, demonstrating directly that members of the Kv4 -subunit subfamily underlie Ito in the mouse ventricle. Therefore, it would seem reasonable to suggest that the Kv4.2W362F transgenics could potentially provide a rational experimental model for probing the molecular mechanisms underlying long-QT syndromes and other cardiac arrhythmias. Interestingly, however, in spite of the marked increases in action potential durations and QT intervals, the expression of Kv4.2W362F does not appear to have profound physiological or pathophysiological consequences. In fact, the Kv4.2W362F-expressing animals appear normal in every respect, and in experiments completed to date, we find no evidence that these animals are prone to develop arrhythmias. However, experiments aimed at determining if there are experimental conditions (such as pacing and adrenergic Barry et al periments focused on identifying the Kv subunit(s) that underlies the novel K current that is upregulated in Kv4.2W362F-expressing animals have also been initiated.

10196741	DNA sequence analyses of Vssc1 alleles from several independent super-kdr fly strains identified two amino acid substitutions associated with the super-kdr trait: replacement of leucine at position 1014 with phenylalanine (L1014F), which has been shown to cause the kdr resistance trait in this species, and replacement of methionine at position 918 with threonine (M918T). House fly sodium channels that were specifically modified by site-directed mutagenesis to contain the M918T/L1014F double mutation gave reduced levels of sodium current expression in oocytes but otherwise exhibited functional properties similar to those of wildtype channels and channels containing the L1014F substitution. However, M918T/L1014F channels were completely insensitive to high concentrations of the pyrethroids cismethrin and cypermethrin. House fly sodium channels specifically modified to contain the M918T single mutation, which is not known to exist in nature except in association with the L1014F mutation, gave very small sodium currents in oocytes. These results define the functional significance of the Vssc1 mutations associated with the super-kdr trait of the house fly and are consistent with the hypothesis that the super-kdr trait arose by selection of a second-site mutation (M918T) that confers to flies possessing it even greater resistance than the kdr allele containing the L1014F mutation. / Insect Biochemistry and Molecular Biology 29 (1999) 185194 mutation of leucine at position 1014 to phenylalanine (designated L1014F) in all knockdown-resistant strains, and mutation of methionine at position 918 to threonine (designated M918T) in combination with the L1014F mutation in strains carrying the super-kdr trait (Williamson et al., 1996). Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis to insert the L1014F mutation into the wildtype Vssc1 cDNA and expression of the wildtype and specifically mutated Vssc1/tipE sodium channels in Xenopus oocytes demonstrated that the L1014F mutation reduced the pyrethroid sensitivity of house fly sodium channels at least 10-fold, an effect sufficient to account for the magnitude of resistance to pyrethroids conferred by the kdr trait (Smith et al., 1997). Here, we describe the construction by site-directed mutagenesis of Vssc1 cDNAs containing either the M918T/L1014F double mutation that is associated with the super-kdr resistance trait or the M918T single mutation, the expression of functional sodium channels from these specifically mutated cDNAs, and the effects of these mutations on the pyrethroid sensitivity of expressed Vssc1/tipE sodium channels. For the present study, 3.7-kb fragments corresponding to the 5 halves of the wildtype or specifically mutated L1014F cDNAs (Smith et al., 1997) cloned in the mutagenesis vector pAlter-1 (Promega, Madison, WI) were subjected to oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis to replace the existing methionine codon (ATG) for amino acid residue 918 with a threonine codon (ACG). Full-length cDNA clones containing the M918T and M918T/L1014F mutations were assembled as described previously (Smith et al., 1997) and were sequenced in their entirety prior to their use as templates for the synthesis of cRNA.

Comparison of the expression of wildtype and specifically mutated Vssc1/tipE sodium channels shows that the M918T and L1014F mutations produced opposite effects on the average amplitude of expressed sodium currents. The L1014F mutation increased the mean amplitude of those currents when compared with wildtype channels, although the increase in current amplitude was not statistically significant. In the double mutant, the M918T mutation also reduced the amplitudes of the expressed currents when compared with L1014F channels (p = 0.0001). We investigated the voltage dependence of activation of Vssc1/tipE channels carrying the M918T or M918T/L1014F mutations by determining the amplitude of the peak transient sodium currents obtained upon a 50-msec depolarization from a holding potential of 120 mV to test potentials ranging from 90 to 80 mV. 1 shows a family of sodium current traces obtained under these conditions from an oocyte expressing Vssc1/tipE channels with the M918T/L1014F double mutation (Fig. 1c for multiple experiments with Vssc1/tipE channels carrying either the M918T or M918T/L1014F mutations.

The M918T/L1014F variant also exhibited a small but statistically significant depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation when compared to wildtype Vssc1/channels (p = 0.0025), but the midpoint potential for this variant was not significantly different (p 0.05) from that for the L1014F variant. We also examined the effects of the M918T or M918T/L1014F mutations on the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation of Vssc1/tipE sodium channels. 2a shows a family of current traces obtained using this pulse protocol from a single oocyte expressing the M918T/L1014F variant and Fig. 2b for multiple experiments with Vssc1/tipE channels carrying the M918T/L1014F or M918T mutations. Table 2 also includes previously published data for the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation of wildtype Vssc1/tipE channels (Smith et al., 1997) that have been re-analyzed to facilitate statistical comparisons between Vssc1 variants as well as values for the L1014F variant derived from a combination of previously published (Smith et al., 1997) and unpublished data. The midpoint potentials for steady-state inactivation measured for all Vssc1/tipE variants were very similar; there was no significant difference in any of the binary comparisons among the wildtype, L1014F, and M918T/L1014F channels. However, the midpoint potential for steady-state inactivation of the M918T variant was significantly shifted in the direction of hyperpolarization when compared to both the wildtype (p = 0.02) and M918T/L1014F (p 0.0001) variants.

In nine such experiments with oocytes expressing M918T/L1014F channels, we were unable to detect any modification of sodium currents by concentrations of cismethrin that produce conspicuous modification of currents carried by wildtype channels. 4a) to the effects of a 10-fold higher concentration of cypermethrin on the M918T/L1014F variant (Fig. Effects of cismethrin on the wildtype and M918T/L1014F variants of the Vssc1/tipE sodium channel.

The present study extends this work to consider the impact of the M918T/L1014F double mutation associated with superkdr resistance (Williamson et al., 1996) on the functional properties and pyrethroid sensitivity of Vssc1/tipE sodium channels expressed in oocytes. In 22 separate experiments with channels containing the M918T mutation, either alone or in combination with the L1014F mutation, we did not detect any sodium tail currents at concentrations of either cismethrin or cypermethrin that produced extensive modifications of currents carried by either the wildtype or L1014F variants (Smith et al., 1997, 1998). The M918T mutation does not enhance the pyrethroid resistance caused by the L1014F mutation in an additive manner but instead appears to provide by itself a high level of resistance to pyrethroids that supercedes the effect of the L1014F mutation. These toxicity data predict that M918T/L1014F channels should be substantially more resistant to cypermethrin than to cismethrin when compared to wildtype channels. However, the complete insensitivity of M918T/L1014F channels to both cismethrin and cypermethrin under the assay conditions employed in this study is consistent neither with this prediction nor with the clearly measurable toxicity of these two pyrethroids to super-kdr house flies (Farnham et al., 1987). Therefore, we conclude that the low levels of expression observed for the M918T and M918T/L1014F variants reflect a direct effect of the substitution of threonine for methionine in this position. Moreover, currents carried by the M918T and M918T/L1014F variants when coexpressed with tipE have inactivation time constants similar to those of currents carried by Vssc1/tipE channels rather than to currents carried by Vssc1 channels in the absence of tipE (T. However, this effect does not appear to be related to impaired expression because a similar shift in voltage dependence was not observed for the M918T/L1014F variant. Patch clamp analyses of single sodium channels expressed in oocytes would provide significant insight into the impact of the M918T and L1014F mutations, singly or in combination, on the conductance properties of Vssc1/tipE sodium channels. The impact of the corresponding mutation to threonine (M918T) in Vssc1 on functional properties of this channel over a wide range of assay temperatures is not known, but such an effect could conceivably underlie the reduced functional expression of M918T and M918T/L1014F channels in oocytes. Moreover, the M918T mutation has been found so far only in insect strains that also carry the L1014F mutation and exhibit high levels of pyrethroid resistance (Williamson et al., 1996; Guerrero et al., 1997). The apparent absence of such mutant strains, in contrast to the abundance of strains carrying the L1014F mutation, suggests that the L1014F mutation partially complements or rescues a functional deficiency of the M918T mutation, thereby permitting expression of the high level of resistance to pyrethroids caused by the M918T mutation. / Insect Biochemistry and Molecular Biology 29 (1999) 185194 193 sis is consistent with the hypothesis that the super-kdr allele originated from the selection of the M918T substitution as a second-site mutation in kdr populations that already carried the L1014F mutation. DNA sequence analyses of Vssc1 alleles from several independent super-kdr fly strains identified two amino acid substitutions associated with the super-kdr trait: replacement of leucine at position 1014 with phenylalanine (L1014F), which has been shown to cause the kdr resistance trait in this species, and replacement of methionine at position 918 with threonine (M918T). House fly sodium channels that were specifically modified by site-directed mutagenesis to contain the M918T/L1014F double mutation gave reduced levels of sodium current expression in oocytes but otherwise exhibited functional properties similar to those of wildtype channels and channels containing the L1014F substitution. However, M918T/L1014F channels were completely insensitive to high concentrations of the pyrethroids cismethrin and cypermethrin. House fly sodium channels specifically modified to contain the M918T single mutation, which is not known to exist in nature except in association with the L1014F mutation, gave very small sodium currents in oocytes. These results define the functional significance of the Vssc1 mutations associated with the super-kdr trait of the house fly and are consistent with the hypothesis that the super-kdr trait arose by selection of a second-site mutation (M918T) that confers to flies possessing it even greater resistance than the kdr allele containing the L1014F mutation. / Insect Biochemistry and Molecular Biology 29 (1999) 185194 mutation of leucine at position 1014 to phenylalanine (designated L1014F) in all knockdown-resistant strains, and mutation of methionine at position 918 to threonine (designated M918T) in combination with the L1014F mutation in strains carrying the super-kdr trait (Williamson et al., 1996). Here, we describe the construction by site-directed mutagenesis of Vssc1 cDNAs containing either the M918T/L1014F double mutation that is associated with the super-kdr resistance trait or the M918T single mutation, the expression of functional sodium channels from these specifically mutated cDNAs, and the effects of these mutations on the pyrethroid sensitivity of expressed Vssc1/tipE sodium channels. Full-length cDNA clones containing the M918T and M918T/L1014F mutations were assembled as described previously (Smith et al., 1997) and were sequenced in their entirety prior to their use as templates for the synthesis of cRNA.

Comparison of the expression of wildtype and specifically mutated Vssc1/tipE sodium channels shows that the M918T and L1014F mutations produced opposite effects on the average amplitude of expressed sodium currents. In contrast, the M918T mutation severely reduced the amplitudes of the the expressed currents when compared to wildtype channels (p = 0.015). In the double mutant, the M918T mutation also reduced the amplitudes of the expressed currents when compared with L1014F channels (p = 0.0001). We investigated the voltage dependence of activation of Vssc1/tipE channels carrying the M918T or M918T/L1014F mutations by determining the amplitude of the peak transient sodium currents obtained upon a 50-msec depolarization from a holding potential of 120 mV to test potentials ranging from 90 to 80 mV. 1 shows a family of sodium current traces obtained under these conditions from an oocyte expressing Vssc1/tipE channels with the M918T/L1014F double mutation (Fig. 1c for multiple experiments with Vssc1/tipE channels carrying either the M918T or M918T/L1014F mutations.

The midpoint potential for activation of the M918T variant was not significantly different from the values for either the wildtype channel or the other two variants. We also examined the effects of the M918T or M918T/L1014F mutations on the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation of Vssc1/tipE sodium channels. 2a shows a family of current traces obtained using this pulse protocol from a single oocyte expressing the M918T/L1014F variant and Fig. 2b for multiple experiments with Vssc1/tipE channels carrying the M918T/L1014F or M918T mutations. The midpoint potentials for steady-state inactivation measured for all Vssc1/tipE variants were very similar; there was no significant difference in any of the binary comparisons among the wildtype, L1014F, and M918T/L1014F channels. However, the midpoint potential for steady-state inactivation of the M918T variant was significantly shifted in the direction of hyperpolarization when compared to both the wildtype (p = 0.02) and M918T/L1014F (p 0.0001) variants.

In nine such experiments with oocytes expressing M918T/L1014F channels, we were unable to detect any modification of sodium currents by concentrations of cismethrin that produce conspicuous modification of currents carried by wildtype channels. 4a) to the effects of a 10-fold higher concentration of cypermethrin on the M918T/L1014F variant (Fig. Effects of cismethrin on the wildtype and M918T/L1014F variants of the Vssc1/tipE sodium channel.

(b) Currents from an oocyte expressing the M918T/L1014F variant of the Vssc1/tipE sodium channel measured before and after exposure to 150 M cypermethrin. 4b shows the results of one of five experiments in which the oocytes expressing M918T/L1014F channels were exposed to high concentrations of cypermethrin and subjected to the same prepulse protocol as in Fig. None of these experiments provided evidence for the detectable modification of currents carried by M918T/L1014F channels by high concentrations of cypermethrin. The small amplitudes of expressed currents that we observed with the M918T variant (Table 1) limited the assessment of the effects of the M918T single mutation on the pyrethroid sensitivity of Vssc1/tipE sodium channels. Seven oocytes expressing M918T channels gave sodium currents of sufficient amplitude ( 100 nA) and stability to permit assays of the effects of cismethrin. 5b show a parallel experiment using an oocyte expressing the M918T variant of the Vssc1/tipE sodium channel, which gave peak transient currents similar in amplitude to those in Fig. The present study extends this work to consider the impact of the M918T/L1014F double mutation associated with superkdr resistance (Williamson et al., 1996) on the functional properties and pyrethroid sensitivity of Vssc1/tipE sodium channels expressed in oocytes. The principal finding of this study is that the M918T mutation abolished the sensitivity of Vssc1/tipE sodium channels to pyrethroids. Effects of cismethrin on the wildtype and M918T variants of the Vssc1/tipE sodium channel. (b) Currents from an oocyte expressing the M918T variant of the Vssc1/tipE sodium channel. In 22 separate experiments with channels containing the M918T mutation, either alone or in combination with the L1014F mutation, we did not detect any sodium tail currents at concentrations of either cismethrin or cypermethrin that produced extensive modifications of currents carried by either the wildtype or L1014F variants (Smith et al., 1997, 1998). In three of seven experiments with the M918T variant, we observed a noninactivating current during a depolarizing pulse in the presence of cismethrin. The M918T mutation does not enhance the pyrethroid resistance caused by the L1014F mutation in an additive manner but instead appears to provide by itself a high level of resistance to pyrethroids that supercedes the effect of the L1014F mutation. Our experiments were unable to determine whether the M918T mutation directly modifies the affinity of the pyrethroid binding site or whether this mutation limits the pyrethroid-dependent modification of channel kinetics. These toxicity data predict that M918T/L1014F channels should be substantially more resistant to cypermethrin than to cismethrin when compared to wildtype channels. However, the complete insensitivity of M918T/L1014F channels to both cismethrin and cypermethrin under the assay conditions employed in this study is consistent neither with this prediction nor with the clearly measurable toxicity of these two pyrethroids to super-kdr house flies (Farnham et al., 1987). In addition to its effect on pyrethroid sensitivity, the M918T mutation also impaired the expression of functional Vssc1/tipE sodium channels in oocytes. We also sequenced this clone in its entirety a second time during the course of our expression studies to ensure that expression was not impaired by undetected mutations in the cDNA encoding the M918T variant. Finally, we are able to rule out bias in oocytes against the codon introduced by site-directed mutagenesis as a cause of the poor expression of the M918T variant because the wildtype Vssc1 cDNA which expresses well in this system, 192 S. Therefore, we conclude that the low levels of expression observed for the M918T and M918T/L1014F variants reflect a direct effect of the substitution of threonine for methionine in this position. The impaired expression associated with the M918T mutation could result either from aberrant regulation or processing of the mutant channel or from the failure of this channel to coassemble with the tipE auxiliary subunit, so that the proportion of channels that are inserted in functional form in the oocyte membrane is reduced. The M918T substitution introduces a novel hydroxyl group in an intracellular domain of the sodium channel protein that could serve as a substrate for protein kinasemediated phosphorylation, a known mode of sodium channel down-regulation (Catterall, 1992; Fozzard and Hanck, 1996). We consider altered coassembly of the M918T variant with the tipE protein also to be an unlikely cause of impaired expression because both the proportion of oocytes expressing detectable currents and the mean amplitude of those currents in experiments with the M918T variant in the presence of tipE were reduced to an extent that could not be accounted for simply by the prevention of coassembly with tipE (compare data in Table 1 for the wildtype Vssc1 variant in the absence of tipE to those for the M918T variant in the presence of tipE). Moreover, currents carried by the M918T and M918T/L1014F variants when coexpressed with tipE have inactivation time constants similar to those of currents carried by Vssc1/tipE channels rather than to currents carried by Vssc1 channels in the absence of tipE (T. Alternatively, the M918T variant could be translated, processed, transported and inserted in the membrane normally but fail to function like the wildtype channel. Our comparisons of the voltage dependence of activation and steady-state inactivation of the wildtype and specifically mutated channel variants identified a statistically significant shift in the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation of the M918T variant. However, this effect does not appear to be related to impaired expression because a similar shift in voltage dependence was not observed for the M918T/L1014F variant. A significant reduction in unitary conductance of sodium channels containing the M918T mutation could also account for the low levels of expression observed with this channel. However, there is no precedent from sitedirected mutagenesis studies with vertebrate sodium channels that would identify the cytoplasmic loop between domains IIS4 and IIS5, the location of the M918T mutation, as an important determinant of channel conductance (Fozzard and Hanck, 1996). Patch clamp analyses of single sodium channels expressed in oocytes would provide significant insight into the impact of the M918T and L1014F mutations, singly or in combination, on the conductance properties of Vssc1/tipE sodium channels. The impact of the corresponding mutation to threonine (M918T) in Vssc1 on functional properties of this channel over a wide range of assay temperatures is not known, but such an effect could conceivably underlie the reduced functional expression of M918T and M918T/L1014F channels in oocytes. Moreover, the M918T mutation has been found so far only in insect strains that also carry the L1014F mutation and exhibit high levels of pyrethroid resistance (Williamson et al., 1996; Guerrero et al., 1997). In view of the high level of pyrethroid resistance conferred by the M918T mutation in our assays, it is surprising that this single mutation has not been selected in pyrethroidresistant insect populations. The apparent absence of such mutant strains, in contrast to the abundance of strains carrying the L1014F mutation, suggests that the L1014F mutation partially complements or rescues a functional deficiency of the M918T mutation, thereby permitting expression of the high level of resistance to pyrethroids caused by the M918T mutation. / Insect Biochemistry and Molecular Biology 29 (1999) 185194 193 sis is consistent with the hypothesis that the super-kdr allele originated from the selection of the M918T substitution as a second-site mutation in kdr populations that already carried the L1014F mutation. In humans, a mutation of the conserved isoleucine residue of the skeletal muscle sodium channel at the position corresponding to Met918 of Vssc1 to threonine (I693T) is correlated with a form of paramyotonia congenita, a heriditary muscle disorder, that is distinguished by cold-induced muscle weakness (Plassart et al., 1996). This association implies a temperature-dependent impairment of sodium channel function caused by the I693T mutation. 
10644771	Electrophysiological analysis of other Gly-499 mutants (G499K, G499Q, and G499E) suggests that the positive charge introduced by the G499R mutation may be responsible for this unique gating behavior. Functional Analysis of G499K, G499Q, and G499E Mutations--In order to understand how the G499R mutation causes such a dramatic change in the gating of the ClC-1 channels, we constructed several missense mutations of Gly-499 in the ClC-1 protein. The G499E channels did not exhibit the inverted-gating property of G499(R/K). Instead, G499E ClC-1 channels deactivated slowly upon hyperpolarization from a holding potential of 45 mV and exhibited much slower deactivation kinetics (Fig. In contrast to the WT deactivation requiring a fit with two exponential functions, only a single time constant was needed to describe the deactivation of G499E ClC-1 channels (Fig. Furthermore, the Po-voltage relationship of G499E ClC-1 channels was very different from that of the WT ClC-1 channels (Fig. The Po of G499E increased over the range of positive potentials and could be described by a single Boltzmann func- FIG.

D, the voltage dependence of relative Po for G499E ClC-1 channels (filled squares) (n 10). The V1/2 for G499E ClC-1 channels was 89.7 4.9 mV (slope factor, 48.2 3.2 mV). The anion-dependent gating mechanism could also be applied to the G499E mutant channels. As the membrane becomes more depolarized, binding of Cl to the external binding site increases, and the open probability of G499E channels increases (Fig. Our observations on G499R, G499K, and G499E ClC-1 channels further support the role of chloride ions in the voltage-dependent gating of this channel. Functional analyses of R496Q, R496Q/G499R, R496K, and E500Q mutant channels suggest that the charged residues in domain 10 are important for normal channel function. Functional Consequences of R496Q, R496Q/G499R, R496K, E500Q, and G482R Mutations in ClC-1 Channels--Due to the importance of charged residues at position 499 in D10, we also examined Arg-496, the only charged residue in D10 of the WT channel (Fig. 2), to Gln (E500Q). Expression of E500Q ClC-1 channels yielded a current similar to WT (Fig. E500Q ClC-1 channel currents. Currents were recorded from HEK-293 cells transfected with E500Q ClC-1 cDNA, using deactivating (A) and activating (B) protocols. C, voltage dependence of relative Po for E500Q ClC-1 channels (filled squares) (n 5). The V1/2 for E500Q ClC-1 channels was 49.8 5.6 mV (slope factor, 31.3 2.0 mV). Electrophysiological analysis of other Gly-499 mutants (G499K, G499Q, and G499E) suggests that the positive charge introduced by the G499R mutation may be responsible for this unique gating behavior. Functional Analysis of G499K, G499Q, and G499E Mutations--In order to understand how the G499R mutation causes such a dramatic change in the gating of the ClC-1 channels, we constructed several missense mutations of Gly-499 in the ClC-1 protein. If the unusual gating of G499R ClC-1 channels was only charge-related, then the properties of G499K should be similar to G499R. 6, A and B, shows current traces recorded from HEK-293 cells transfected with G499K ClC-1 cDNA. The Po-voltage curve for G499K ClC-1 56.9 4.6 was also similar to G499R ClC-1 (Fig. 6C, V1/2 mV; slope factor, 17.4 2.3 mV; for G499K). This hyperpolarizationactivated gating of the G499R and G499K mutants could result from either electrostatic or structure changes (or both) at this residue. G499K ClC-1 channel currents. Currents were recorded from HEK-293 cells transfected with G499K cDNA using deactivating (A) and activating (B) protocols. C, voltage dependence of relative Po for G499K ClC-1 channels (filled squares) (n 5). The V1/2 for G499K ClC-1 channels was 56.9 4.6 mV (slope factor, 17.4 2.3 mV). We have demonstrated that the introduction of a positive charge at position 499 (G499R or G499K) of D10 could also evoke this unique gating of ClC-1. Because the inverted gating behavior was only observed for the G499R and G499K mutants, we propose that an additional positively charged residue in D10 may introduce a new chloride binding site near the conducting pore of the ClC-1 channel. Our observations on G499R, G499K, and G499E ClC-1 channels further support the role of chloride ions in the voltage-dependent gating of this channel. In contrast to WT ClC-1 channels that normally deactivate in response to hyperpolarization under physiologic conditions, one ClC-1 mutant (D136G) has been shown to activate upon hyperpolarization (36, 37). Functional analysis revealed that G499R ClC-1 channels activate upon hyperpolarization, similar to D136G ClC-1 channels. A similar phenomenon has also been described for the D136G mutation (36). Implication of G499(R/K) for a Model of Inverted ClC-1 Gating--Hyperpolarization-activated gating behavior of ClC-1 observed in the G499(R/K) mutants has been noted previously in a naturally occurring Becker's mutation, D136G (36), and in WT ClC-1 channels when external pH was lowered to 5.5 (38). It has been proposed that D136G, located in D1, could be involved in voltage-dependent gating of ClC-1 channels (36). Similar gating defects caused by both G499R and D136G mutations suggest that charge changes at these positions of ClC-1 could affect voltage-dependent gating in a similar way in these mutant channels. Both G499R and D136G mutations result in the addition of positive charge or reduction of negative charge. Very likely, as in G499R ClC-1 channels, the charge change plays a similar role in the hyperpolarization-activated D136G ClC-1 channels. Alternatively, we also cannot exclude the possibility that Arg496 is important as a part of an intrinsic voltage-sensor in WT ClC-1 channels, similar to the mechanism of D136G proposed by Fahlke et al. Functional analyses of R496Q, R496Q/G499R, R496K, and E500Q mutant channels suggest that the charged residues in domain 10 are important for normal channel function. Functional Consequences of R496Q, R496Q/G499R, R496K, E500Q, and G482R Mutations in ClC-1 Channels--Due to the importance of charged residues at position 499 in D10, we also examined Arg-496, the only charged residue in D10 of the WT channel (Fig. We replaced Arg-496 with Lys (R496K) and showed that channel current was similar to that of WT (Fig. R496K ClC-1 channel currents. Currents were recorded from HEK-293 cells transfected with R496K ClC-1 cDNA, using deactivating (A) and activating (B) protocols. C, voltage dependence of relative Po for R496K ClC-1 channels (filled squares) (n 5). The V1/2 for the R496K mutant was 97.8 5.2 mV (slope factor, 32.0 1.6 mV). Electrophysiological analysis of other Gly-499 mutants (G499K, G499Q, and G499E) suggests that the positive charge introduced by the G499R mutation may be responsible for this unique gating behavior. Functional Analysis of G499K, G499Q, and G499E Mutations--In order to understand how the G499R mutation causes such a dramatic change in the gating of the ClC-1 channels, we constructed several missense mutations of Gly-499 in the ClC-1 protein. The gating of G499Q ClC-1 channels (Fig. However, unlike WT ClC-1 channels, the Po-voltage curve of G499Q ClC-1 channel currents could not be simply fitted by single Boltzmann function (Fig. G499Q ClC-1 channel currents. Currents were recorded from HEK-293 cells transfected with G499Q ClC-1 cDNA, using deactivating (A) and activating (B) protocols. C, voltage dependence for relative Po of G499Q ClC-1 channels (filled squares) (n 6). This mutation, Gly-499 to Arg (G499R) is located in the putative transmembrane domain 10 of the ClC-1 protein. Functional analyses of R496Q, R496Q/G499R, R496K, and E500Q mutant channels suggest that the charged residues in domain 10 are important for normal channel function. Functional Consequences of R496Q, R496Q/G499R, R496K, E500Q, and G482R Mutations in ClC-1 Channels--Due to the importance of charged residues at position 499 in D10, we also examined Arg-496, the only charged residue in D10 of the WT channel (Fig. Because Arg-496 and Gly-499 are in close proximity in the putative -helical structure for D10, we hypothesized that G499R might compensate for the charge loss of the R496Q mutation. However, the double mutant (R496Q/ G499R) did not functionally express (data not shown). As with the R496Q mutant, expression of G482R ClC-1 channels did not yield detectable current (data not shown). Similar to R496Q, the naturally occurring mutation R496S also did not yield any detectable current (17). Furthermore, the G499R mutation failed to compensate for the R496Q charge loss, although they are thought to be in close proximity based on the putative -helical structure of D10. Similar to R496Q, the naturally occurring mutation R496S also did not yield any detectable current (17). In the present study, we identified a novel G499R mutation and a previously known nonsense R894X mutation (14, 23) in a Becker's MC family. Our genetic analysis indicates that G499R and R894X are transmitted as recessive alleles. Despite the fact that R894X mutation produces a truncated protein, expression of mutant channels was reported to cause a reduction but not a complete abolition of chloride conductance (21). Therefore, it is likely that any muscle membrane chloride conductance in our patient results from channels encoded by the R894X allele. Site-directed Mutagenesis--Two missense mutations, G499R and G482R (21), and seven point mutations (see under "Results") were introduced into the pRc/CMV-ClC-1 vector by standard two-step PCRbased site-directed mutagenesis. Functional Consequences of R496Q, R496Q/G499R, R496K, E500Q, and G482R Mutations in ClC-1 Channels--Due to the importance of charged residues at position 499 in D10, we also examined Arg-496, the only charged residue in D10 of the WT channel (Fig. The G482R mutation was originally identified in a Becker's MC family (21) (Fig. As with the R496Q mutant, expression of G482R ClC-1 channels did not yield detectable current (data not shown). Finally, the G482R mutation, located at the amino-terminal end of D10, completely abolishes chloride conductance. In contrast to the G499R mutation, in which the channels are still conducting, this observation suggests that the G482R may also affect folding, trafficking, or degradation of the ClC-1 channels.

E, mutation (K708A) in the NBD1 Walker A motif of SUR2A prevented the effect of both orthovanadate and BeFx on KATP channels. Specifically, orthovanadate-induced KATP channel opening was abolished either by replacing aspartate with asparagine in the Walker B motif of the SUR2A NBD2 (D1470N), a mutation that disrupts ATP hydrolysis (3, 32), or by exchanging lysine for alanine in the Walker A motif of NBD1 (K708A), which precludes ATP binding to SUR1 (20; Fig. It was reduced to 5 3% in the D1470N mutant and to 3 1 % in the K708A mutant (n 4; Fig. Similarly, either the D1470N or the K708A mutation reversed the inhibitory effect of beryllium fluoride (Fig. Accordingly, KATP channel activity in the presence of 0.1 mM MgADP and 1 mM BeFx was in wild-type, D1470N, and K708A 14208 Tandem Function of NBDs and KATP Channel Gating FIG.

Site-directed Mutagenesis--Point mutations in the core consensus sequence of the Walker motifs of NBD1 and NBD2 in the hamster cardiac SUR isoform, SUR2A, were introduced in the pCDNA3.1 plasmid by PCR amplification of both DNA strands with complementary primers containing desired amino acid changes (QuickChange, Stratagene). Transfection of Kir6.2 and SUR2A Clones--COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum plus 2 mM glutamine and seeded at 2 106 cells prior to transfection. Kir6.2, with wild-type or mutated SUR2A, were subcloned into the expression vector pCDNA3.1 (5, 14). pCDNA3.1-SUR2A (10 g) and pCDNA3.1-Kir6.2 (1 g) were included with the expression vector for green fluorescent protein (0.5 g of pGREEN-lantern, Invitrogen) used as a reporter gene. Nucleotide binding domains of SUR2A required for KATP channel gating by -phosphate analogs. B, average channel activity of Kir6.2 co-expressed in COS-1 cells with wild-type SUR2A or with SUR2A mutated in either NBD2 (aspartate to asparagine, D1470N) or NBD1 (lysine to alanine, K708A) in the presence of -phosphate analogs, orthovanadate (1 mM) plus ATP (0.25 mM) and BeFx (1 mM) plus ADP (0.1 mM), respectively. C, vigorous opening of wild-type (wt) Kir6.2/SUR2A channels visualized in inside-out patches as a downward deflection relative to the zero current level (dotted line). Rather, in the presence of Mg2 and ADP, BeFx inhibited Kir6.2/SUR2A channel opening. E, mutation (K708A) in the NBD1 Walker A motif of SUR2A prevented the effect of both orthovanadate and BeFx on KATP channels. Vigorous activation of ATP-inhibited wild-type recombinant KATP channels (Kir6.2/SUR2A, Fig. Specifically, orthovanadate-induced KATP channel opening was abolished either by replacing aspartate with asparagine in the Walker B motif of the SUR2A NBD2 (D1470N), a mutation that disrupts ATP hydrolysis (3, 32), or by exchanging lysine for alanine in the Walker A motif of NBD1 (K708A), which precludes ATP binding to SUR1 (20; Fig. Intact NBD1 and NBD2 of SUR2A necessary for cooling induced KATP channel opening. A, in an inside-out patch, ATPinduced inhibition of wild-type (w.t.) Kir6.2/SUR2A channels, was reversed by a cooling period. B, mutations in Walker A (1349 lysine to alanine) and B (1470 aspartate to asparagine) motifs of NBD2 in the SUR2A subunit (K1349A/D1470N) significantly reduced ATP-induced inhibition of recombinant KATP channels following cooling. C, mutation of the Walker A (708 lysine to alanine) domain of NBD1 in SUR2A (K708A) abolished the antagonism of ATP-induced KATP channel inhibition following cooling. Disruption of either NBD1 or NBD2 through mutation precluded the reduction in ATPsensitivity observed after cooling in wild-type Kir6.2/SUR2A KATP channels (Fig. In wild-type Kir6.2/SUR2A channels, parameters defining the time course were as follows: Imax 1.12 0.04, T0.5 0.60 0.03, and k 0.24 0.03 (n 3; Fig. B, mutations in Walker A (1349 lysine to alanine) and B (1470 aspartate to asparagine) motifs of NBD2 in the SUR2A subunit (K1349A/D1470N) significantly reduced ATP-induced inhibition of recombinant KATP channels following cooling. The K1349A/D1470N mutations significantly decreased and delayed activation of KATP channels (Imax 0.42 0 .04, T0.5 0.92 0.05, k 0.16 0.04, n 3; Fig. B, average channel activity of Kir6.2 co-expressed in COS-1 cells with wild-type SUR2A or with SUR2A mutated in either NBD2 (aspartate to asparagine, D1470N) or NBD1 (lysine to alanine, K708A) in the presence of -phosphate analogs, orthovanadate (1 mM) plus ATP (0.25 mM) and BeFx (1 mM) plus ADP (0.1 mM), respectively.

B, mutations in Walker A (1349 lysine to alanine) and B (1470 aspartate to asparagine) motifs of NBD2 in the SUR2A subunit (K1349A/D1470N) significantly reduced ATP-induced inhibition of recombinant KATP channels following cooling. Specifically, mutations in the Walker motifs of NBD2 (K1349A and/or D1470N), which diminish the intrinsic ATPase activity (3), attenuated KATP channel activation following cooling (Fig. The K1349A/D1470N mutations significantly decreased and delayed activation of KATP channels (Imax 0.42 0 .04, T0.5 0.92 0.05, k 0.16 0.04, n 3; Fig.

We have recently reported a F1490L 19.1 0.6; n = 28 66.3 0.8; n = 29 73.1 2.5; n = 9 mutation in the S5 segment of domain IV, F1490L + 1 18.5 0.8; n = 7 70.0 1.9; n = 7 ND M1493I 13.0 0.9; n = 21 56.6 1.0; n = 19 62.3 2.1; n = 9 I1495F, which also causes HyperKPP (8). M1493I + 1 15.2 1.6; n = 6 65.1 2.6; n = 6 ND Interestingly, the I1495F mutation also enhances Na+ channel slow inactivation. However, in contrast to F1490L-M1493I, which apparently affects only slow inactivation is known, the molecular entity involved in Na+ vation, I1495F altered fast inactivation and the voltchannel slow inactivation is still under investigation.

Five different HyperKPP mutations (T704M, A1156T, M1360V, I1495F, and M1592V) have been identified in the muscle Na+ channel gene. The only defect produced by the double mutant (F1490L-M1493I, expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells) is an enhancement of slow inactivation, a unique behavior not seen in the 24 other disease-causing mutations.

Four cDNA constructs (wild-type [WT], F1490L, M1493I, and F1490LM1493I) were introduced into the pRc-CMV vector heterologously expressed in HEK 293 cells, and studied using the whole-cell voltage clamp technique. Figure 3 shows that whereas the F1490L mutant shifts the steady-state inactivation to the left (V1/2 = 66.3 0.85 mV, n = 29, P < 0.001), M1493I shifts the inactivation curve to the right (V1/2 = 56.6 1.0 mV, n = 19, P < 0.001) compared with the WT (V1/2 = 62.1 0.75 mV, n = 43).

The activation curves were affected in a different manner: the F1490L mutation slightly, but not significantly, shifted the activation curve to the left (V1/2 = 19.1 0.65 mV, n = 28, P = 0.08), and the M1493I shifted the activation curve to the right (V1/2 = 13.0 0.89 mV, n = 21, P < 0.001). However, the double mutant F1490L-M1493I slightly shifted the midpoint of activation to hyperpolarizing potentials (WT V1/2 = 17.7 0.44 mV, n = 47; F1490L-M1493I V1/2 = 20.1 0.62 mV, n = 24, P < 0.003). Deactivation time constants were monitored at voltages ranging from 120 mV to 60 mV and revealed no significant change between WT and either the single mutants F1490L and M1493I or the double mutant channels (Figure 4b). Figure 5a shows that slow inactivation was significantly enhanced in F1490L mutant channels (s 1/2 = 73.1 2.5 mV, n = 9, P < 0.005) and in the double mutant channels (s1/2 = 73.8 1.9 mV, n = 18, P < 0.05), but slightly shifted to the right for the M1493I mutant channels (s1/2 = 62.3 2.1 mV, n = 9, P = 0.23). As Figure 5b illustrates, although only 50% of WT channels are slow inactivated when held at 60 mV (for 50 seconds), almost 90% of F1490L-M1493I channels are slow inactivated at the same holding potential. Peak Na+ conductance (GNa) was measured during a 25-millisecond depolarization to various test potentials from a holding potential of 120 mV to characterize steady-state activation for WT (filled circles; n = 47), F1490L (filled diamonds; n = 28), M1493I (filled squares; n = 21), and double mutant F1490L-M1493I (open circles; n = 24).

Recovery from slow inactivation, on the other hand, was slower for double mutant and F1490L channels than for WT channels (Figure 5d).

12202369	We have recently shown that mutations of the nonconserved R378 in the AID motif specifically decreased the kinetics and voltage dependence of inactivation in CaV2.3, whereas the E462R mutation in Biophysical Journal 83(3) 1429 1442 CaV1.2 accelerated inactivation kinetics (Berrou et al., 2001; Bernatchez et al., 2001b). Despite being enclosed within the AID motif, CaV2.3 R378E, CaV1.2 E462R, and CaV1.2/CaV2.3 chimeras were found to be typically modulated by subunits in terms of the kinetics and the voltage dependence of inactivation (Berrou et al., 2001; Bernatchez et al., 2001a). RESULTS -Subunit overlay assays in the I-II linker of CaV2.3 We have recently shown that the nonconserved residue R378 within the AID motif of CaV2.3 channels disrupted specifically the kinetics and voltage dependence of inactivation, whereas the reverse mutation E462R in CaV1.2 accelerated inactivation kinetics (Berrou et al., 2001; Bernatchez et al., 2001a). In contrast, the nonconserved mutations R378E and the multiple mutant R365G A366D I376L D R378E E379D N381K R384L A385D 388T K389Q preserved -subunit binding (see Fig. 1, in vitro translated 35 [S]methionine 3 could bind to the wild-type GST-AIDE, the GST-AID(R378E), and the multiple mutant GST-AIDC (R365G A366D I376L R378E E379D N381K R384L A385D D388T K389Q) (RAIRENRADK-GDLEDKLDTQ), which includes all the nonconserved residues within the AID motif mutated to their counterparts in CaV1.2. As far as -subunit binding is concerned, multiple mutations of the nonconserved residues within the AID m R otif, as in the CaV2.3 R365G A366D I376L 378E E379D N381K R384L A385D D388T K389Q mutant, did not disrupt [35S] 3 overlay binding to GST fusion proteins from CaV2.3, suggesting that 3 binding to the I-II linker is not critically sensitive to the nature of residues interwoven in the AID motif. In contrast, the nonconserved mutations R378E and the multiple mutant R365G A366D I376L D R378E E379D N381K R384L A385D 388T K389Q preserved -subunit binding (see Fig. 1, in vitro translated 35 [S]methionine 3 could bind to the wild-type GST-AIDE, the GST-AID(R378E), and the multiple mutant GST-AIDC (R365G A366D I376L R378E E379D N381K R384L A385D D388T K389Q) (RAIRENRADK-GDLEDKLDTQ), which includes all the nonconserved residues within the AID motif mutated to their counterparts in CaV1.2.

W386A mutation impairs -subunit binding and modulation of CaV2.3 Correlation between -subunit binding and modulation was investigated in the following series of experiments. 2, the W386A CaV2.3 channel was expressed with or without ( ) 3 or 2a in Xenopus oocytes. Expression of the W386A mutant yielded robust inward Ba2 currents with current-voltage relationships typical of voltage-gated Ca2 channels. In the absence of exogenous subunits, the W386A, R378E, and wild-type CaV2.3 channels activated within the same voltage range. W386A/ 2b activated at 6 0.5 E 7 1 mV (n 7), which is similar to E0.5 2 mV (n 10) for CaV2.3wt/ 2b currents (see also Parent et al., 1997; Berrou et al., 2001). Hence in the absence of exogenous 3, the activation parameters of W386A, R378E, and wild-type CaV2.3 channels were comparable. In contrast, 3 induced a significant hyperpolarizing shift in the E0.5,act values of R378E and CaV2.3 wild type, whereas it did not affect W386A. Furthermore, coexpression with 3 failed to significantly increase Ba2 peak currents of W386A (Table 1). In contrast, the inactivation kinetics of W386A were not significantly affected by 3 or 2a subunit or significantly modulated by the membrane potential. Although its inactivation kinetics was slower than CaV2.3/ 2b , W386A/ 2b displayed significantly faster inactivation than R378E/ 2b , thus confirming the key role of R378 in the voltage-dependent inactivation of CaV2.3. Finally, the voltage dependence of inactivation was measured for W386A, R378E, and the wild-type channel in the presence and in the absence of 3 using 5-s prepulses. In contrast, there was no discernible binding of radiolabeled 3 to the GST-AID(W386A).

The wild-type CaV2.3 (first row), R378E (second row), and W386A (third row) were expressed in Xenopus oocytes in the presence of 2b without subunits (left panel), 2b 3 (middle panel), or 2b 2a (right panel). In the absence of subunits, the r300 ratios ranked R378E W386A wild type (from the slowest to the fastest). The inactivation kinetics of W386A remained insensitive to the presence of either 3 or 2a. As seen, coexpression with 3 did not shift the inactivation curves for W386A with E0.5,inact 39 2 mV (n 6) for W386A/ 2b as compared with E0.5,inact 35 1 mV (n 6) for W386A/ 2b / 3 channels.

(C) The r300 values for the wild-type CaV2.3, W386A, R378E, R378E W386A channels 3 (from left to right at each voltage) show that the inactivation kinetics of W386A and R378E W386A were not significantly accelerated by 3. Whether in the absence or in the presence of 3, the inactivation kinetics of W386A were slower than the wild-type channel but faster than R378E. The R378E W386A mutant combined the individual properties of R378E and W386A mutants as it inactivated like R378E and did not show any -subunit-induced modulation. 3 significantly shifted the voltage dependence to the left for CaV2.3wt from 36 3 mV (n 10) to 64 2 mV (n 10) and for R378E from 26 2 mV (n 7) to 44 2 mV (n 11) but failed to influence the voltage dependence of W386A or W386A R 378E.

We attempted to unravel the role of the I-II linker in the functional modulation of CaV2.3 by investigating the -subunit binding and modulation as well as the inactivation properties of the R378E, W386, and the R378E W386A mutants. Although W386A channels failed to be typically modulated by 3 subunits, their inactivation properties (kinetics and voltage depenBiophysical Journal 83(3) 1429 1442 1440 Berrou et al. For instance, although the voltage dependence of inactivation of W386A, W386R, and W386F mutants was indistinguishable from the wild-type CaV2.3/ 2b (without 3), the W386E, W386G, and W386Q channels inactivated distinctively at more positive voltages. Interestingly, the slightly less polar phenylalanine residue, albeit bearing a similar phenyl group, behaved like the W386A channel. In contrast, the nonconserved mutations R378E and the multiple mutant R365G A366D I376L D R378E E379D N381K R384L A385D 388T K389Q preserved -subunit binding (see Fig. 1, in vitro translated 35 [S]methionine 3 could bind to the wild-type GST-AIDE, the GST-AID(R378E), and the multiple mutant GST-AIDC (R365G A366D I376L R378E E379D N381K R384L A385D D388T K389Q) (RAIRENRADK-GDLEDKLDTQ), which includes all the nonconserved residues within the AID motif mutated to their counterparts in CaV1.2. As far as -subunit binding is concerned, multiple mutations of the nonconserved residues within the AID m R otif, as in the CaV2.3 R365G A366D I376L 378E E379D N381K R384L A385D D388T K389Q mutant, did not disrupt [35S] 3 overlay binding to GST fusion proteins from CaV2.3, suggesting that 3 binding to the I-II linker is not critically sensitive to the nature of residues interwoven in the AID motif. In contrast, the nonconserved mutations R378E and the multiple mutant R365G A366D I376L D R378E E379D N381K R384L A385D 388T K389Q preserved -subunit binding (see Fig. 1, in vitro translated 35 [S]methionine 3 could bind to the wild-type GST-AIDE, the GST-AID(R378E), and the multiple mutant GST-AIDC (R365G A366D I376L R378E E379D N381K R384L A385D D388T K389Q) (RAIRENRADK-GDLEDKLDTQ), which includes all the nonconserved residues within the AID motif mutated to their counterparts in CaV1.2.

Whereas a strong signal was recorded for the wild-type channel, R378E, and RAIRENRADK-GDLEDKLDTQ, [35S] 3 binding could not be detected for W386A.

Despite being enclosed within the AID motif, CaV2.3 R378E, CaV1.2 E462R, and CaV1.2/CaV2.3 chimeras were found to be typically modulated by subunits in terms of the kinetics and the voltage dependence of inactivation (Berrou et al., 2001; Bernatchez et al., 2001a). In contrast, the nonconserved mutations R378E and the multiple mutant R365G A366D I376L D R378E E379D N381K R384L A385D 388T K389Q preserved -subunit binding (see Fig. Wholecell current traces of the wild-type CaV2.3 and the R378E mutant are shown alongside for comparison. In the absence of exogenous subunits, the W386A, R378E, and wild-type CaV2.3 channels activated within the same voltage range. Hence in the absence of exogenous 3, the activation parameters of W386A, R378E, and wild-type CaV2.3 channels were comparable. In contrast, 3 induced a significant hyperpolarizing shift in the E0.5,act values of R378E and CaV2.3 wild type, whereas it did not affect W386A. In this regard, R378E behaved like CaV2.3wt with r300 values smaller in the presence of 3 and significantly larger with 2a (Fig. Furthermore, the R378E channel displayed slower inactivation kinetics than CaV2.3wt under the same subunit background, in agreement with our previous study (Berrou et al., 2001). Although its inactivation kinetics was slower than CaV2.3/ 2b , W386A/ 2b displayed significantly faster inactivation than R378E/ 2b , thus confirming the key role of R378 in the voltage-dependent inactivation of CaV2.3. Finally, the voltage dependence of inactivation was measured for W386A, R378E, and the wild-type channel in the presence and in the absence of 3 using 5-s prepulses. 1, in vitro translated 35 [S]methionine 3 could bind to the wild-type GST-AIDE, the GST-AID(R378E), and the multiple mutant GST-AIDC (R365G A366D I376L R378E E379D N381K R384L A385D D388T K389Q) (RAIRENRADK-GDLEDKLDTQ), which includes all the nonconserved residues within the AID motif mutated to their counterparts in CaV1.2.

In the absence of subunits, the r300 ratios ranked R378E W386A wild type (from the slowest to the fastest). In contrast, the inactivation kinetics of R378E were accelerated by 3 and slowed by 2a in a manner similar to the wild-type channel. In contrast, the E0.5,inact values for R378E and the wild-type channels were shifted to the left by 20 30 mV in the presence of 3.

FIGURE 4 Inactivation properties of the double mutant R378E W386A. (A and B) Whole-cell current traces were recorded in the presence of 10 mM Ba2 for the double R378E W386A mutant with 2b either without exogenous 3 (A) or after co-injection of 3 (B). (C) The r300 values for the wild-type CaV2.3, W386A, R378E, R378E W386A channels 3 (from left to right at each voltage) show that the inactivation kinetics of W386A and R378E W386A were not significantly accelerated by 3. Whether in the absence or in the presence of 3, the inactivation kinetics of W386A were slower than the wild-type channel but faster than R378E. The R378E W386A mutant combined the individual properties of R378E and W386A mutants as it inactivated like R378E and did not show any -subunit-induced modulation. 3 significantly shifted the voltage dependence to the left for CaV2.3wt from 36 3 mV (n 10) to 64 2 mV (n 10) and for R378E from 26 2 mV (n 7) to 44 2 mV (n 11) but failed to influence the voltage dependence of W386A or W386A R 378E. The binding experiments further agree with our previous report showing that -subunit modulation of inactivation was preserved in the R378E channel (Berrou et al., 2001). Furthermore, our current study confirmed that the inactivation kinetics of R378E were consistently slower than CaV2.3wt when expressed under the same subunit background (Figs. Altogether, our data support the conclusion that the changes in the inactivation properties reported for R378E in CaV2.3 were likely to be conferred by the 1 subunit itself (Berrou et al., 2001). We attempted to unravel the role of the I-II linker in the functional modulation of CaV2.3 by investigating the -subunit binding and modulation as well as the inactivation properties of the R378E, W386, and the R378E W386A mutants. The R378E channel displayed decreased inactivation kinetics and voltage dependence, although it preserved typical 3-subunit binding and modulation. We examined this proposition by W investigating the properties of the double mutant R378E 386A. The double mutant lacks 3-subunit modulation, but its inactivation properties were shown to be identical to the R378E/ 2b channel. Hence, mutating the neighboring residue W386 does not further decrease the kinetics and voltage dependence of inactivation of R378E. The situation appears to be different with the R378E mutant in CaV2.3 as it displayed slower inactivation kinetics and reduced voltage dependence of inactivation as compared with the wild-type channel whether in the presence or absence of coexpressed 3 or 2a subunits (Fig. It hence remains to be seen whether this pattern of selectivity among subunits is preserved in CaV2.3 and more specifically in R378E. In contrast, the nonconserved mutations R378E and the multiple mutant R365G A366D I376L D R378E E379D N381K R384L A385D 388T K389Q preserved -subunit binding (see Fig. 1, in vitro translated 35 [S]methionine 3 could bind to the wild-type GST-AIDE, the GST-AID(R378E), and the multiple mutant GST-AIDC (R365G A366D I376L R378E E379D N381K R384L A385D D388T K389Q) (RAIRENRADK-GDLEDKLDTQ), which includes all the nonconserved residues within the AID motif mutated to their counterparts in CaV1.2. As far as -subunit binding is concerned, multiple mutations of the nonconserved residues within the AID m R otif, as in the CaV2.3 R365G A366D I376L 378E E379D N381K R384L A385D D388T K389Q mutant, did not disrupt [35S] 3 overlay binding to GST fusion proteins from CaV2.3, suggesting that 3 binding to the I-II linker is not critically sensitive to the nature of residues interwoven in the AID motif. Whole-cell current traces for Y383S 3 (not shown) and Y383A 3 channels were typical of HVA Ca2 channels.

(C) The corresponding r300 values are shown for Y383A u 3 and Y383S . The inactivation kinetics of Y383S (n 4) was not significantly influenced by 3 (p 0.1), whereas those for Y383A 3 (n 7) were significantly different at p 0.05. In the absence or in the presence of 3, the inactivation kinetics of Y383A and Y383S were slower than the wild-type channel and similar to W386A. 3 significantly shifted the voltage dependence of inactivation for Y383A from 32 1 mV (n 4) to 55 2 mV (n 4) and for Y383S from 24 1 mV (n 4) to 42 2 mV (n 4). 1, in vitro translated 35 [S]methionine 3 could bind to the wild-type GST-AIDE, the GST-AID(R378E), and the multiple mutant GST-AIDC (R365G A366D I376L R378E E379D N381K R384L A385D D388T K389Q) (RAIRENRADK-GDLEDKLDTQ), which includes all the nonconserved residues within the AID motif mutated to their counterparts in CaV1.2. As far as -subunit binding is concerned, multiple mutations of the nonconserved residues within the AID m R otif, as in the CaV2.3 R365G A366D I376L 378E E379D N381K R384L A385D D388T K389Q mutant, did not disrupt [35S] 3 overlay binding to GST fusion proteins from CaV2.3, suggesting that 3 binding to the I-II linker is not critically sensitive to the nature of residues interwoven in the AID motif. Our findings thus extend previous reports that the equivalent mutation R387E in CaV2.1 retains the ability to bind [35S] 3 (Bichet et al., 2000b). This contrasts with the recent observation that the similar mutation in CaV2.1 (R387E) slowed down the inactivation kinetics of CaV2.1 but only when measured in a 4 background (Geib et al., 2002). In line with our observations, deWaard and collaborators have recently proposed that the altered inactivation properties of the R387E mutant in CaV2.1 resulted from the disruption of the intra-subunit interaction between the cytoplasmic I-II and the III-IV linkers (Geib et al., 2002). In CaV2.1, R387E was shown to inactivate faster than the wild-type channel in the absence of 4. In contrast, the nonconserved mutations R378E and the multiple mutant R365G A366D I376L D R378E E379D N381K R384L A385D 388T K389Q preserved -subunit binding (see Fig. 1, in vitro translated 35 [S]methionine 3 could bind to the wild-type GST-AIDE, the GST-AID(R378E), and the multiple mutant GST-AIDC (R365G A366D I376L R378E E379D N381K R384L A385D D388T K389Q) (RAIRENRADK-GDLEDKLDTQ), which includes all the nonconserved residues within the AID motif mutated to their counterparts in CaV1.2.

Nonetheless, the inactivation kinetics of W386G and W386Y remained voltage dependent and accelerated with depolarization. 3 had no significant effect on the voltage dependence of inactivation for W386A, W386G, and W386E but barely shifted the E0.5 of W386Y to the left (p 0.05). Furthermore, the tryptophan-to-tyrosine substitution that preserved an aromatic residue at position 386 (W386Y) yielded channels that inactivated at more negative potentials than the wild-type channel expressed without 3 subunits.

10051544	Interestingly, examination of the kdr mutation L1014F occurring in the II-S6 transmembrane segment of the housefly sodium channel (Smith et al., 1997) showed reduction of pyrethroid sensitivity without obvious changes in gating properties. The PCR reactions were conducted with primers Nhp1375 (5 -CCGAACCCTAACTACGGNTA-3 ) and IS6r2 (5 -CTGTTCCTCTTCTTCGGCTT-3 ) for determination of the polymorphism at V421M in I-S6, and primers Nhp3304 (5 ATGTGGGACTGIATGTTGGT-3 ) and Nhp3448- (5 -CTGTTGAAGGCCTCTGCTAT-3 ) for determination of the polymorphism at L1029H in II-S6 according to reaction conditions described previously (Park et al., 1997; Park and Taylor, 1997). The sequence for the Pyr-R strain was obtained in both directions from one individual specimen for the L1029H site and two specimens for the V421M site. PCRs coupled with restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (RFLP) were conducted with Hsp92II and RcaI for L1029H and V421 M sites, respectively, as described previously (Park et al., 1997; Park and Taylor, 1997). For the L1029H site, Hsp92II cut at the motif CATG was counted as histidine and uncut as leucine (Fig. virescens collected from Louisiana revealed the L1029H mutation (arrow, C) in the II-S6 segment (Park and Taylor, 1997). The second polymorphism is a leucine-to-methionine change at amino acid 1029 (L1029H) in transmembrane segment II-S6 (Fig. virescens (Park and Taylor, 1997) Pyr-R individuals were examined for the occurrence of mutations V421M and L1029H. Restriction with Hsp92II in the region L1029H of II-S6 (Park and Taylor, 1997) failed in both Pyr-R and UCR-S individuals, which indicates the absence of the L1029H mutation in the specimens tested (Fig. virescens decreased during the interval 1990 to 1996/1997, whereas the incidence of the L1029H mutation increased during the same period (Park, 1998). Mutations N434K and I433K (the latter copositional with 421 in the hscp channel) in the rat 1 sodium channel abolish sensitivity to batrachotoxin (Wang and Wang, 1998). They found that the N434A mutation produced a large effect on voltage-dependent gating, whereas N434K did not. A virtually copositional mutation of the rat 1 sodium channel (N434A; corresponds to 422 in the hscp channel; see Fig. They found that the N434A mutation produced a large effect on voltage-dependent gating, whereas N434K did not. We examined the properties and relative density of sodium channels in central neurons of susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant (Pyr-R) insects that were homozygous for the amino acid substitution V421M in the I-S6 transmembrane segment. Since then, the resistance trait has been correlated with the amino acid substitution V421M in the I-S6 transmembrane segment of the hscp sodium channel (H. The PCR reactions were conducted with primers Nhp1375 (5 -CCGAACCCTAACTACGGNTA-3 ) and IS6r2 (5 -CTGTTCCTCTTCTTCGGCTT-3 ) for determination of the polymorphism at V421M in I-S6, and primers Nhp3304 (5 ATGTGGGACTGIATGTTGGT-3 ) and Nhp3448- (5 -CTGTTGAAGGCCTCTGCTAT-3 ) for determination of the polymorphism at L1029H in II-S6 according to reaction conditions described previously (Park et al., 1997; Park and Taylor, 1997). The sequence for the Pyr-R strain was obtained in both directions from one individual specimen for the L1029H site and two specimens for the V421M site. For the V421M site, RcaI cut at the TCATGA motif was counted as methionine and uncut as valine (Fig. Sequence comparisons made between the Pyr-R and UCR-S strains (except for dashed areas at the amino and carboxyl termini) showed only one sequence polymorphism: V421M (arrow, B) in the I-S6 transmembrane segment (Park et al., 1997). One polymorphism, detected in individual specimens ancestral to Pyr-R (RR; see Park et al., 1997), involves a deduced amino acid change from valine to methionine at position 421 (V421M) located in the IS-6 transmembrane segment (I-S6 nomenclature of Noda et al., 1986; see Fig. virescens (Park and Taylor, 1997) Pyr-R individuals were examined for the occurrence of mutations V421M and L1029H. Restriction with RcaI in the region corresponding to the mutation V421M in I-S6 was positive at the motif TCATGA in all four Pyr-R specimens tested, which indicates that this genotype is fixed in the Pyr-R strain and that all four individual specimens were homozygous for the V421M mutation (Fig. Similar analysis of UCR-S specimens confirmed the absence of the V421M mutation. The deduced amino acid sequence in the I-S6 segment reflecting the V421M mutation is aligned with related sodium channel homologs (Fig. Comprehensive sequence comparison of UCR-S and RR strains encompassing almost the entire coding region of the channel ( 80%, except amino and carboxyl termini) showed that the V421M mutation is the only coding polymorphism (Park et al., 1997). The V421M mutation associated with pyrethroid resistance in the Pyr-R strain and comparable positions in other sodium channels are shown in bold. Discussion Our examination of sodium channels in central neurons of Pyr-R insects has yielded evidence for structural change resulting from the mutation V421M reported previously (Park et al., 1997). This evidence includes nervous system insensitivity to pyrethroids (Payne, 1987), cross-resistance to pyrethroids and DDT (Brown et al., 1996), genetic linkage between resistance and the hscp sodium channel (Taylor et al., 1993), and the mutation V421M in the I-S6 transmembrane segment of the channel (Park et al., 1997). The V421M substitution fits an emerging pattern of S6 mutations implicated in kdr-like pyrethroid resistance. Based on the prevalence of S6 mutations in Pyr-R insects, the V421M substitution is well placed as a causal factor in the resistance observed in the Pyr-R strain. Does the V421M substitution account for the differences in sodium channel properties we have observed in this study? This seems likely, based on extensive sequencing of the hscp gene and the nature of the alterations we have observed. V421M is the only sequence polymorphism found in hscp sequence comparisons between UCR-S and Pyr-R specimens encompassing 80% of the channel sequence (Park et al., 1997). These shifts are similar to those we have associated with the V421M substitution. Based on this corroborative evidence, the V421M substitution seems well situated to account for reduced pyrethroid sensitivity and shifts in voltagedependent gating properties we have found. Modification of site 3 affinity by the V421M mutation thus has a reasonable biochemical and structural basis. What is the relationship between reduced pyrethroid sensitivity and altered voltage-dependent gating in Pyr-R sodium channels? The V421M mutation might alter the pyrethroid binding site directly, or allosterically by modifying voltage-dependent conformational states of the channel. Heterologous expression should provide additional evidence for a causal relationship between the V421M substitution and altered channel properties and should allow us to distinguish between direct effects of mutations on the pyrethroid binding site and indirect effects occurring through altered voltagedependent conformational states of the channel. This suggests a possible fitness cost associated with the V421M substitution. virescens (Campanhola et al., 1991) may result from decreased neuronal excitability associated with the V421M mutation. Indeed, population genetic analysis of pyrethroid resistance mutations revealed that the frequency of the V421M allele in field populations of H. Our findings provide some of the first detailed molecular and physiological correlates of this type of resistance, and support the hypothesis that the V421M mutation modifies either the pyrethroid binding site directly or allosterically. Mutations N434K and I433K (the latter copositional with 421 in the hscp channel) in the rat 1 sodium channel abolish sensitivity to batrachotoxin (Wang and Wang, 1998).

Similar results were observed for TM8 containing mutations Y917C, R933S, H939D, and H939R (Fig. (55) when an Asp residue was engineered into an artificial TM segment (L23V). CFTR is somewhat unusual, in that 7 of its 12 TM segments 39507 39508 CFTR C-terminal Transmembrane Assembly TCTTCAGA(D924V), CCACTGGTGCGCACTCTAATCACAGTGTCG(H939R), ATCATCAACAGCACCAGTTCGTATT(T908N), CATAGTCGACAAAACAGCTATGCAGTGATT(N900Q), and CAGAATTCTAATGCAACTATTATCACCAGCACCAGTT(N900Q/Y903N/V906T). In addition, a naturally occurring CF-related mutation T908N, which introduces a consensus site just four residues from TM8, was also efficiently glycosylated both in the WT context and in the N900Q mutant (Fig. This latter finding is consistent with previous studies (45) showing that T908N is also glycosylated in full-length CFTR expressed in mammalian cells. Consistent with its effect on TM8 ST activity, the D924V mutation prevented access of oligosaccharyltransferase to the T908N consensus site. CFTR is somewhat unusual, in that 7 of its 12 TM segments 39507 39508 CFTR C-terminal Transmembrane Assembly TCTTCAGA(D924V), CCACTGGTGCGCACTCTAATCACAGTGTCG(H939R), ATCATCAACAGCACCAGTTCGTATT(T908N), CATAGTCGACAAAACAGCTATGCAGTGATT(N900Q), and CAGAATTCTAATGCAACTATTATCACCAGCACCAGTT(N900Q/Y903N/V906T). Instead, TM8 stop transfer activity is specifically dependent on TM7, which functions both to initiate translocation and to compensate for the charged residue within TM8. Detailed examination of TM7 and TM8 further revealed that a charged residue within TM8 (Asp924) interferes with TM8 stop transfer activity and confers an unexpected flexibility on TM8 boundaries. Moreover, TM7 was specifically required for TM8 stop transfer activity because TM8 failed to terminate translocation when engineered into an otherwise secretory protein containing a cleaved signal sequence. We therefore tested the effect of D924V mutation on TM8 stop transfer activity by engineering TM8 together with its flanking residues into a chimeric cassette previously used to define stop transfer sequences derived from bitopic and polytopic proteins (Fig. The D924V mutation, however, markedly improved TM8 stop transfer activity and terminated translocation in 90% of polypeptides, all of which acquired Nlum/Ccyt topology (Figs. D924V Eliminates TM8 Flexibility--Finally, we tested whether strengthening TM8 stop transfer activity also influenced the extension of TM8 into the ER lumen. Effect of D924V mutation on TM8 stop transfer activity. WT and mutant TM8 stop transfer activities. Our observation that TM8 stop transfer function is dependent on the presence of TM7 significantly increases the complexity of stop transfer function during polytopic protein biogenesis. CFTR is somewhat unusual, in that 7 of its 12 TM segments 39507 39508 CFTR C-terminal Transmembrane Assembly TCTTCAGA(D924V), CCACTGGTGCGCACTCTAATCACAGTGTCG(H939R), ATCATCAACAGCACCAGTTCGTATT(T908N), CATAGTCGACAAAACAGCTATGCAGTGATT(N900Q), and CAGAATTCTAATGCAACTATTATCACCAGCACCAGTT(N900Q/Y903N/V906T). These studies suggest that in addition to functioning as a signal sequence, TM7 also enables ER translocation machinery to properly recognize TM8 as a transmembrane segment thus positioning D924V in the plane of the membrane. However, the D924V mutation consistently resulted in a 10fold decrease in the amount of reporter translocated (Fig. The D924V mutation replaces a charged residue near the middle of the predicted TM8 segment and thus significantly increases TM8 hydrophobicity. We therefore tested the effect of D924V mutation on TM8 stop transfer activity by engineering TM8 together with its flanking residues into a chimeric cassette previously used to define stop transfer sequences derived from bitopic and polytopic proteins (Fig. The D924V mutation, however, markedly improved TM8 stop transfer activity and terminated translocation in 90% of polypeptides, all of which acquired Nlum/Ccyt topology (Figs. D924V Eliminates TM8 Flexibility--Finally, we tested whether strengthening TM8 stop transfer activity also influenced the extension of TM8 into the ER lumen. In the D924V mutant, both the native glycosylation sites (Asn894 and Asn900) as well as the engineered site, Asn903 are efficiently utilized ( 90% glycosylation, Fig. In contrast to wild type TM8, however, the D924V mutation completely prevented glycosylation at residue Asn908 (Fig. Thus, the improved ability of TM8 to terminate translocation in the D924V mutant limits the accessibility of TM8 N-terminal flanking residues to OST as would be expected for a bona fide stop transfer sequence. Effect of D924V mutation on TM8 stop transfer activity. A, Kyte/Doolittle hydropathy plot of CFTR TM7 8 region for WT (left panel) and D924V mutant (right panel). D924V prevents lumenal extension of TM8. 6 were engineered into a D924V background, and topology (A) and glycosylation (B) were determined by protease protection and endoglycosidase digestion. Consistent with its effect on TM8 ST activity, the D924V mutation prevented access of oligosaccharyltransferase to the T908N consensus site. The CFTR C-terminal Transmembrane Assembly D924V mutant would then shift the TM boundaries by increasing hydrophobicity of the N-terminal region, thus sterically blocking glycosylation at residue 908. In contrast, the D924V mutant would impose new folding constraints that favor membrane integration and helix formation within the lipid bilayer, thus decreasing the time for OST accessibility and increasing the apparent rigidity of TM8 membrane boundaries. CFTR is somewhat unusual, in that 7 of its 12 TM segments 39507 39508 CFTR C-terminal Transmembrane Assembly TCTTCAGA(D924V), CCACTGGTGCGCACTCTAATCACAGTGTCG(H939R), ATCATCAACAGCACCAGTTCGTATT(T908N), CATAGTCGACAAAACAGCTATGCAGTGATT(N900Q), and CAGAATTCTAATGCAACTATTATCACCAGCACCAGTT(N900Q/Y903N/V906T). Similar results were observed for TM8 containing mutations Y917C, R933S, H939D, and H939R (Fig. Sense oligonucleotides used for each mutation are as follows: TTTTGCATTTATGTGGGAGTAGCCGACACT(Y917C), GGATTCTTCTCGGGTCTACCACTGGTGCAT(R933S), CCACTGGTCGACACTCTAATCACAGTGTCG(H939D), GCCGTGACTTTGCTAGCTATGGGAT- To compare the behavior of topogenic determinants encoded within CFTR TMD1 and TMD2, coding sequences were truncated after each TM segment and tagged at the C terminus with a translocation reporter derived from bovine prolactin.

Preapplication of IVM on oocytes expressing the V251T mutant provoked a small (6.4 2%, n 7) but consistent increase in the leakage current in the absence of agonist. Furthermore, as in the case of the V251T, no modification of the response time course was detected for the L247T mutant (Fig. Effects of IVM preapplication on oocytes expressing the 7-V251T (A) and 7-L247T (B) mutants.

Thick lines, recordings obtained after IVM preapplication (30 M, 15 sec for 7-V251T; 10 sec for 7-L247T). They have been interpreted in terms of differential alteration of the states and conformational equilibria of the nAChR: a selective permeabilization of the desensitized state for L247T and a modification of the equilibrium constant L between basal and active states for V251T (Galzi et al., 1996b). Consistent with the notion that IVM potentiates nicotinic receptor responses by shifting the conformational equilibrium in favor of the active state, it still potentiates the V251T mutant but no longer affects the L247T mutant (Fig. Furthermore, in oocytes expressing the V251T mutant, the current leakage is increased by IVM, and this current can be blocked by MLA. This indicates that on the V251T mutant, IVM behaves as a positive allosteric effector. Channel inset, point mutations (V251T and L247T). 3) corresponding to the activation from B to A with different L values comparable to those predicted for (right to left) the wild-type and V251T and V251T after IVM preapplication. The equilibrium constant (L value) describing the equilibrium between the basal (B) and active (A) states can be set to 12 (for the V251T, see Fig. 9C shows that changing only the L value may result in a slight agonistic effect of IVM on the V251T. The V251T mutation then would lead to a significant reduction in L ( 1000), thus leading to an increased apparent affinity for agonist together with higher cooperativity and higher response amplitude (Galzi et Potentiation of the 7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor by Ivermectin 293 al., 1996b). These data therefore document and demonstrate further that the V251T and L247T mutations differentially alter the properties of the allosteric states and conformational equilibria of the 7 nAChR, and, as a consequence, their responsiveness to IVM potentiation. To examine the possible contribution of the endogenous Cl channels on the ACh-evoked currents, three approaches were used: 1) determination of IVM potentiation in an external solution containing Ba2 instead of Ca2 , 2) measurements of the reversal potential of the ACh-evoked current at control and after IVM preapplication, and 3) investigation of the potentiation of the Ca2 -impermeant mutant 7-E237A (Bertrand et al., 1993). 3B illustrate that mutant 7-E237A is strongly potentiated by IVM.

In contrast, when the experiments were repeated in oocytes expressing the L247T mutant, a different pattern was observed (Fig. Furthermore, as in the case of the V251T, no modification of the response time course was detected for the L247T mutant (Fig. Effects of IVM preapplication on oocytes expressing the 7-V251T (A) and 7-L247T (B) mutants.

Values of L 30, KA 0.8 M, and KB 3.3 M (five binding sites) were used for the L247T both at control and after IVM. A scaling factor of 0.3 was added to take into account the lower current amplitude of L247T mutant after IVM. Thick lines, recordings obtained after IVM preapplication (30 M, 15 sec for 7-V251T; 10 sec for 7-L247T). They have been interpreted in terms of differential alteration of the states and conformational equilibria of the nAChR: a selective permeabilization of the desensitized state for L247T and a modification of the equilibrium constant L between basal and active states for V251T (Galzi et al., 1996b). Consistent with the notion that IVM potentiates nicotinic receptor responses by shifting the conformational equilibrium in favor of the active state, it still potentiates the V251T mutant but no longer affects the L247T mutant (Fig. Channel inset, point mutations (V251T and L247T). Such an interpretation also is in agreement with the data obtained on the L247T mutant receptor. Indeed, according to the interpretation proposed previously (Revah et al., 1991; Galzi et al., 1996b), the channel of the L247T mutant would become open in the desensitized conformation, and the equilibrium constants between the conformational states would not be altered. These data therefore document and demonstrate further that the V251T and L247T mutations differentially alter the properties of the allosteric states and conformational equilibria of the 7 nAChR, and, as a consequence, their responsiveness to IVM potentiation.

Double point mutations of arginines in this post-M2 region of the human -ENaC ( hENaC) led to a decrease and increase in the macroscopic conductance of R586E,R587E - and R589E,R591E -hENaC, respectively, but had no effect on the single-channel conductance of either double point mutant. However, the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant for Na was decreased for both R586E,R587E - and R589E,R591E -hENaC, and the maximum amiloride-sensitive Na current was decreased for R586E,R587E -hENaC and increased for R589E,R591E w hENaC. Double point mutations of arginine residues in the post-M2 region of -hENaC resulted in an increase in the R589E,R591E -hENaCand a decrease in the R586E,R587E -hENaC-associated chord conductance but left the single-channel Li conductance unaltered. Radii of channel pore analyses revealed that the diameter of the R586E,R587E -hENaC channel is smaller, and the diameter of the R589E,R591E -hENaC channel is larger, than that of the wild-type channels. Whole cell amiloride-sensitive Na currents after the expression of wild-type -hENaC, R586E,R587E -hENaC, and R589E,R591E -hENaC in oocytes are shown in Fig. Representative whole cell, amiloride-sensitive Na currents are presented in oocytes expressing wild-type - (A), R586E,R587E - (B), and R589E,R591E-hENaC (C). 2B), while the magnitude of the currents induced by the R589E,R591E -hENaC mu0ant was 30% higher than that of the wild type (P t .05, Fig. The corresponding chord conductances carried by 96 mM external Na at 120 mV were 19.05 0.28 (n 21), 13.67 1.41 (n 29), and 25.41 0.9 S (n 23) for wild-type, R586E,R587E hENaC, and R589E,R591E -hENaC, respectively. As before, the inward currents for R586E,R587E -hENaC and R589E,R591E hENaC were smaller and greater, respectively, than those for the wild-type channel.

PLi/PNa was significantly increased from 1.97 to 22.2 for the double point mutant R586E,R587E -hENaC and was virtually unchanged for R589E,R591E -hENaC. However, for R586E,R587E -hENaC and R589E,R591E -hENaC, PNa/PK decreased to 1.8 and 10.0, respectively. Likewise, PLi/PK values for R586E,R587E hENaC and R589E,R591E -hENaC were lower (41 and 14.9, respectively) than that for the wild-type channel (100.5) (Table 1). The apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (Km) for Na were 32.6 2.0 (n 20), 16.3 4 .4 (n 20), and 15.3 3.1 mM (n 20) for wild-type, R586E,R587E -hENaC, and R589E,R591E -hENaC, respectively. The normalized maximal current at saturating [Na ] (i.e., INa) was different for R586E,R587E hENaC and R589E,R591E -hENaC compared with wild type (497 36 and 1,422 80 nA, respectively, vs. The increase in Km with voltage was nearly twice as great for the wild-type channel compared with the two mutant constructs, i.e., there was a 1.96, 1.23, and 1.00 mM change in Km per e-fold change in potential for the wild type, R586E,R587E -hENaC, and R589E,R591E -hENaC, respectively, in the voltage range from 0 to 50 mV.

When the wild-type yellow fluorescence is normalized to 100, the fluorescence of the R589E,R591E -hENaC-injected oocytes averages 157 10 ( SE; n 10), a value significantly different from that of the wild type (P 0.05). These results confirm that the degree of yellow fluorescence is much greater in the R589E,R591E -hENaC-injected oocytes than in either the wild type or R586E,R587E -hENaC-injected oocytes. All patches contained multiple channels, but the probability of finding multiple channels was much greater for the R589E,R591E -hENaC construct than for the other two Table 3. i-V curves are plotted from insideout patches containing wild-type - (A), R586E,R587E - (B), and R589E,R591E -hENaC (C) channels.

For example, from the single-channel experiments, the absolute permeability coefficients of PNa ( 10 6 cm/s) were 1.21, 0.08, and 1.44 for wild-type -, R586E,R587E -, and R589E,R591E -hENaC, respectively.

Li were not altered by R589E and R591E mutations. The increased macroscopic amiloride-sensitive current and increased surface expression of R589E,R591E -hENaC in oocytes (but not R586E,R587E -hENaC) is consistent with the interpretation of the idea that mutations of arginine residues in such a motif increase ER export and surface delivery of ENaC. Double point mutations of arginines in this post-M2 region of the human -ENaC ( hENaC) led to a decrease and increase in the macroscopic conductance of R586E,R587E - and R589E,R591E -hENaC, respectively, but had no effect on the single-channel conductance of either double point mutant. However, the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant for Na was decreased for both R586E,R587E - and R589E,R591E -hENaC, and the maximum amiloride-sensitive Na current was decreased for R586E,R587E -hENaC and increased for R589E,R591E w hENaC. Na ere increased 11.25- to 27.57-fold for R586E,R587E hENaC compared with wild type.

However, the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant for Na was decreased for both R586E,R587E - and R589E,R591E -hENaC, and the maximum amiloride-sensitive Na current was decreased for R586E,R587E -hENaC and increased for R589E,R591E w hENaC.

12766226	Pursuing this clue, we sequenced SCN4A encoding the skeletal muscle sodium channel (Nav1.4) and detected two heteroallelic mutations involving conserved residues not present in 400 normal alleles: S246L in the S4 S5 cytoplasmic linker in domain I, and V1442E in the S3 S4 extracellular linker in domain IV. The genetically engineered V1442E-Na channel expressed in HEK cells shows marked enhancement of fast inactivation close to the resting potential, and enhanced use-dependent inactivation on high-frequency stimulation; S246L is likely a benign polymorphism. The V1442E mutation in SCN4A defines a novel disease mechanism and a novel phenotype with myasthenic features. Because DNA f rom the patient's father was not available for genetic analysis, we examined the allelic distribution of S246L and V1442E by clon ing a cDNA f ragment and by haplot ype analysis. To locate V1442E on the identified haplot ypes, we PCR-amplified and This paper was submitted directly (Track II) to the PNAS office.

14527939	This mutation is analogous to the one made in Kv4.2 to generate Kv4.2W362F, which was shown to function as a Kv4-subfamily-specific dominant negative (3). In these experiments, point mutations were introduced in the pore region of Kv1.5 to change the tryptophan (W) at position 461 to phenylalanine (F) to produce a nonconducting subunit, Kv1.5W461F, that is shown to function as a Kv1 subfamily-specific dominant negative (Kv1.5DN). To explore this hypothesis, a pore mutant of Kv1.5, Kv1.5W461F, was developed and shown to function as a Kv1 subfamily-specific DN (Kv1.5DN). MATERIALS AND METHODS Construction of Kv1.5W461F-Myc. H319 0363-6135/04 $5.00 Copyright 2004 the American Physiological Society 320 SELECTIVE ELIMINATION OF MOUSE VENTRICULAR IK,SLOW1 generate mouse Kv1.5W461F. In addition, the stop codon was removed, and the mutant construct (Kv1.5W461F) was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) in frame with the downstream sequence in the vector encoding the Myc epitope. After heterologous expression in human embryonic kidney-293 (HEK-293) cells, the properties of the resulting construct, Kv1.5W461F-Myc, were characterized in electrophysiological experiments and in immunohistochemical studies using anti-Kv1.5 and anti-Myc antibodies (see below). Functional characterization of Kv1.5W461F. HEK-293 cells, obtained from the Washington University Medical School Tissue Culture Support Center and maintained as described previously (9), were transiently transfected using the calcium-phosphate method with plasmids encoding Kv1.4, Kv1.5, Kv4.2, or Kv1.5W461F-Myc, together with a plasmid-encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (pEGFPN1; Clontech) to allow transfected cells to be identified before electrophysiological recordings. Generation of transgenic mice expressing -MHC-Kv1.5W461FMyc. The Kv1.5W461F-Myc coding sequence was subcloned into the -MHC vector (24, 25) at the SalI site. The resulting -MHCKv1.5W461F plasmid was digested to isolate a 7.5-kb fragment containing the -MHC promoter (25), the Kv1.5W461F-myc coding sequence, and the human growth hormone (hGH) polyadenylation signal sequences. Expression of Kv1.5 and Kv1.5W461F-Myc. For RT-PCR analysis, mRNA was prepared from the ventricles and brains of adult Kv1.5W461F-Myc-expressing transgenic and nontransgenic (control) littermates using the Micro-FasTrack mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen). The forward and reverse primers used for actin, Kv1.5 and Kv1.5W461F were 5 -GTGTTACGTCGCCCTTGATT and 5 -GCTGGAGGTGGACAGAGAG (actin), 5 -GACCACTGTAGGCTATTT and 5 -AGCAGATAAGCAAGCTCAAG (wild-type Kv1.5), and 5 -GACCACTGTAGGCTATGG and 5 -AGATCCTCTTCTGAGATGAG (Kv1.5W461F-Myc). AJP-Heart Circ Physiol VOL To assay Kv1.5W461F-Myc expression, HEK-293 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 Kv1.5W461F-Myc were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at pH 7.4 for 1 h. To examine Kv1.5 and Kv1.5W461F-Myc protein expression, membrane proteins were prepared from mouse ventricles and brains using previously described protocols (911, 15). To generate the putative dominant negative Kv1.5 construct, Kv1.5W461F, mutations were introduced into (mouse) Kv1.5 to change the tryptophan (W) residue at position 461 in the pore region of Kv1.5 to phenylalanine (F). The Kv1.5W461F construct (Fig. When transiently transfected into HEK-293 cells, expression of Kv1.5W461F-Myc is readily detected immunohistochemically using either an anti-Kv1.5 antibody or an anti-Myc antibody (Fig. Whole cell voltage-clamp recordings from Kv1.5W461FMyc-expressing HEK-293 cells revealed no outward K currents (Fig. When equal amounts of the plasmids encoding wild-type Kv1.5 and Kv1.5W461F-Myc were cotransfected into HEK-293 cells; however, the densities of the Kv1.5encoded K currents are reduced significantly (P 0.001) compared with cells expressing wild-type Kv1.5 alone (Fig. The mean SE peak outward K current densities at 40 mV in HEK-293-expressing wild-type Kv1.5 alone or wild-type Kv1.5 plus Kv1.5W461F-Myc (1:1) were 596 55 (n 10) and 46 5 (n 10), respectively. The voltage dependence and the kinetic properties of the Kv1.5-encoded K 1 currents in the absence (n 10) and in the presence (n 0) of Kv1.5W461F-Myc, however, are indistinguishable. These observations suggest that the assembly of wild-type subunits with Kv1.5W461F-Myc leads to the generation of nonfunctional channels rather than to channels with altered time- and/or voltage-dependent properties (i.e., Kv1.5W461F functions as a dominant negative, Kv1.5DN). For the generation of transgenic mice expressing Kv1.5DN, the Myc-tagged Kv1.5W461F DNA sequence was subcloned downstream of the cardiac-specific -MHC promoter in the -MHC expression vector (24, 25). A 7.5-kb fragment containing the -MHC promoter, the Kv1.5W461F-Myc sequence, and the hGH polyadenylation signal sequence was isolated and inwww.ajpheart.org 286 JANUARY 2004 H322 SELECTIVE ELIMINATION OF MOUSE VENTRICULAR IK,SLOW1 Fig. Kv1.5W461F functions as a Kv1 subfamily-specific dominant negative subunit transgene (Kv1.5DN). Three lines (1, 3, and 5) of Kv1.5W461F-Myc (Kv1.5DN)-expressing transgenic mice were established. In the experiments here, point mutations were introduced into the pore region of Kv1.5 to produce Kv1.5W461F.

Phenotypic Characterization of a Novel Long-QT Syndrome Mutation (R1623Q) in the Cardiac Sodium Channel Nicholas G. In contrast to the heritable mutations, this externally positioned domain IV, S4 mutation (R1623Q) neutralized a charged residue that is critically involved in activation-inactivation coupling. Methods and Results--We have characterized the R1623Q mutation in the human cardiac sodium channel (hH1) using both whole-cell and single-channel recordings. In contrast to the autosomal dominant LQT3 mutations, R1623Q increased the probability of long openings and caused early reopenings, producing a threefold prolongation of sodium current decay. Lidocaine restored rapid decay of the R1623Q macroscopic current. Conclusions--The R1623Q mutation produces inactivation gating defects that differ mechanistically from those caused by LQT3 mutations. 4,5,9 Recently, a de novo missense SCN5A mutation (R1623Q) was identified in a Japanese girl severely affected by a sporadic form of the long-QT syndrome.10 In contrast to the familial LQT3 mutations, R1623Q replaced a charged arginine residue with a neutral glutamine at an external position in the S4 segment of domain IV (Fig 1A). Here, we characterize the functional consequences of R1623Q in heterologously expressed human cardiac sodium channels (hH1). F o r t h e l a t t e r , wild-type and R1623Q full-length cDNAs were subcloned from pSP64T into the HindIII-XbaI site of vector pGFPIRS for bicistronic expression of the channel protein and GFP reporter as d e s c r i b e d . Inward current magnitudes were 6.4 nA (wildtype) and 2.9 nA (R1623Q). Biexponential fits [y A1exp( t/ 1) A2exp( t/ 2)] to normalized open-time distributions revealed a more prominent slow component in R1623Q recordings (R1623Q: A1 0.7, A2 0.3, 1 0.1 ms, 2 1.1 ms; wildtype: A1 0.8, A2 0.2, 1 0.2 ms, 2 1.1 ms). Traces were assembled from 100 (wildtype) and 212 (R1623Q) consecutive sweeps. 16 Results F i g 1 B s h o w s I Na r e c o r d e d f r o m C H O - K 1 c e l l s e x p r e s s i n g wild-type or R1623Q sodium channels. For wildtype and R1623Q, paired observations from a single oocyte are shown before (top) and during (bottom) exposure to 200 mol/L lidocaine. Model D (R1623Q): ki 665 s 1, k i 2.9 s 1, kc 497 s 1. Models C and E (identical to wildtype), lidocaine increases ki (reversing effects of R1623Q) and decreases k i (reversing effects of LQT3 mutations). ( 50) was prolonged threefold (Fig 2B: wildtype, 0.94 0.08 ms, n 14; R1623Q, 3.07 0.11 ms, n 28; P .001). Cell-attached patch recordings in CHO-K1 cells (Fig 1C) revealed that, unlike wild-type channels (left), the R1623Q mutant (right) exhibited multiple, prolonged openings early in the depolarization period. The R1623Q ensembleaverage current (Fig 1D) decayed slowly, consistent with whole-cell recordings (Fig 1B). Singleexponential fits to the open-time distributions revealed just a modest increase in R1623Q ( at 20 mV was 0.5 ms versus wildtype, 0.4 ms); however, the open-time distribu- tion in both wildtype and R1623Q was dominated by brief openings ( 0.3 ms). Biexponential fitting revealed a second, longer component ( 2 1.1 ms) that was more prominent in the R1623Q recordings (see legend, Fig 1C). Thus, the slowed rate of R1623Q current decay resulted from both an increased number of openings during depolarization and prolonged individual opening events. 5,18,19 H o w e v e r , a m a j o r Kambouris et al additional feature of the R1623Q mutation is a slowed rate of current decay. Fig 2A (bottom) shows wild-type and R1623Q INa after lidocaine exposure. With lidocaine (200 mol/L), the rate of R1623Q current decay approached that of the wild-type channel. In paired observations, lidocaine significantly hastened the rate of R1623Q INa decay (P .001 versus predrug) but had no effect on wild-type INa decay. In contrast, the mechanism by which R1623Q and the analo g o u s D 4 S 4 m u t a t i o n s ( h S k M 1 R 1 4 4 8 C , R 1 4 4 8 H ) s l o w I Na decay may involve uncoupling activation from inactivat i o n . Conversely, our results, as well as those derived from single-channel studies of the analog o u s d o m a i n - I V , S 4 p a r a m y o t o n i a m u t a t i o n s , 11 s u g g e s t t h a t a different mechanism must underlie the prolonged decay of ensemble-average R1623Q current. In addition, reducing the magnitude of ki relative to k i increases the potential for measurable steady-state (noninactivating) current, consistent with the small persistent current plateau in our R1623Q recordings (Fig 1B and 1D). Analogous to the effect of lidocaine on R1623Q decay (Fig 2A and 2B), we have previously shown that lidocaine enhances the rate of macroscopic current decay when i n a c t i v a t i o n i s d e s t a b i l i z e d b y I I I - I V l i n k e r m u t a t i o n s . Mutagenesis studies of the analogous residue in skeletal muscle sodium channels (hSkM1 P R1448) implicated IV-S4 in coupling between activation and inactivation,11 and two hSkM1 paramyotonia congenita mutations at this position (R1448H, R1448C) 12 disrupted inactivation. The number of openings per depolarization (corrected for channel number) was 0.63 0.05 for R1523Q and 0.51 0.08 for hH1. Mutagenesis studies of the analogous residue in skeletal muscle sodium channels (hSkM1 P R1448) implicated IV-S4 in coupling between activation and inactivation,11 and two hSkM1 paramyotonia congenita mutations at this position (R1448H, R1448C) 12 disrupted inactivation. 16 Lidocaine not only accelerated the rate of 1-F1304Q 643 Discussion current decay by eliminating reopenings but also delayed recovery from inactivation, suggesting that the drug may function like an allosteric effector that both increases the forward rate and decreases the return rate from the inactiv a t e d s t a t e .

11401515	Expressed in oocytes, a mutant in dominant (AQP2-E258K), but not in recessive (AQP2R187C), NDI conferred a specific dominant-negative effect on wild-type (wt) AQP2 water permeability (Pf) only at low expression levels. Expression of a mutant encoded in dominant NDI (AQP2-E258K) revealed that this mutant was functional and retained in the Golgi complex (14). The ability of AQP2-E258K, but not a mutant in recessive NDI (AQP2-R187C), to form heterotetramers with wtAQP2 and to inhibit further routing of wt-AQP2 to the plasma membrane provided an explanation for the observed dominant-negative phenotype of this mutant in the particular NDI family (8). Constructs of the oocyte expression vector pTsT7 containing cDNAs encoding wt-AQP2, FLAG-tagged wt-AQP2 (wt-AQP2-F), AQP2-E258K, AQP2-R187C tagged with a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) peptide (AQP2R187C-V) or AQP2 mutants in recessive NDI were as described (8, 1317). Two days after injection of oocytes with 0.3 ng of SEM) of cRNAs, the water permeability (in m/s wt-AQP2 expressing oocytes was 84 11, while those of oocytes expressing AQP2-E258K (4 6) or AQP2R187C (4 8) were not different from controls (4 3). As a first indication of the purity of the plasma membranes isolated after silica-coating, AQP2-E258K and AQP2-R187C, which are retained in the Golgicomplex and ER, respectively, were not detected in the plasma membrane samples, although both were expressed (total membranes Fig. Oocytes were injected with 0.3 ng cRNAs coding for wt-AQP2 (wt), AQP2-R187C (RC), or AQP2-E258K (EK). Also, AQP2-E258K, which is retained in the Golgi complex in oocytes (14), appears to be retained in the same organelle in mammalian cells (unpublished results). Although all these data were obtained at unrestrained expression levels, it turned out to be essential to control expression levels by injecting around 0.3 ng cRNA in order to observe a specific dominant effect of AQP2-E258K on wt-AQP2 function (18). Also, the absence of AQP2-E258K (Golgi complex) and AQP2-R187C (ER) in silica-coated plasma membranes (Fig. 5) underscore the purity of this fraction and is in line with the absence of an increased water transport for oocytes expressing AQP2-E258K and with immunocytochemical data for both as reported before (8, 18). Expressed in oocytes, a mutant in dominant (AQP2-E258K), but not in recessive (AQP2R187C), NDI conferred a specific dominant-negative effect on wild-type (wt) AQP2 water permeability (Pf) only at low expression levels.

Immunocytochemistry of oocytes expressing wild-type AQP2 or AQP2-R187C. Oocytes were injected with 1 ng wt-AQP2 cRNA (wt), 10 ng AQP2-R187C cRNA (RC), or not injected (ctrl). As shown for N-terminally VSV-G-tagged AQP2-R187C (AQP2RC-V) in Fig. This was corroborated by immunocytochemical analysis, which revealed a dispersed staining pattern of wt-cmyc throughout the cell (not shown), similar to recessive NDI mutants (for AQP2-R187C see Fig. Two days after injection of oocytes with 0.3 ng of SEM) of cRNAs, the water permeability (in m/s wt-AQP2 expressing oocytes was 84 11, while those of oocytes expressing AQP2-E258K (4 6) or AQP2R187C (4 8) were not different from controls (4 3).

11022040	When S1115 was replaced by other amino acids (S1115D, S1115T, or S1115V), only S1115T was slightly sensitive to S-( )-Bay K 8644. Replacement by valine (S1115V) or aspartic acid (S1115D) abolished the effect of S-( )-Bay K 8644 (1 M). The 1C mutants (S1115A, S1146A, and A1420S) and rbCII were transiently expressed in BHK6 cells with 1a and 2/ subunits. However, the S1115A channel was significantly less sensitive to DHP antagonists. Interestingly, in the S1115A channel, DHP agonists failed to enhance whole-cell Ca2 channel currents and the prolongation of mean open time, as well as the increment of NPo. Responsiveness to the non-DHP agonist FPL-64176 was also markedly reduced in the S1115A channel. Single point mutations, S1115A, and S1146A, were introduced into IIIS5-S6 1 41504 This paper is available on line at http://www.jbc.org Critical Determinant of Action of DHP Agonists linker by replacing the PstI (3384)-XmnI (3743) fragment of rbCII, and A1420S was introduced into IVS5-S6 linker by replacing the PvuII (4185)-XhoI (4607) fragment of rbCII using the QuikChange method (Qiagen). Expression and Electrophysiological Properties of Mutant 1C Subunits--We replaced the amino acids in IIIS5-S6 linker and IVS5-S6 linker of rbCII, which were conserved in 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 1E, and 1S but not in TuCa1 or CyCa 1, by corresponding amino acids of TuCa1 (S1115A, S1146A, and A1420S (Fig. The half-activation voltages (Vhalf) and slopes were as follows: Vhalf, slope: 15.9 0.625 mV, 6.74 0.381 (S1115A); 12.9 0.577 mV, 7.54 0.323 (S1146A); 13.2 0.470 mV, 7.56 0.263 (A1420S); 14.2 0.484 c mV, 6.65 0.292 (rbCII), respectively (n 8 14).

A, current-voltage relationships of S1115A (f, n 8), S1146A ( , n 14), A1420S (OE, n 11), and rbCII (E, n 14) are superimposed. Steady-state inactivation curves (B-c) of S1115A (f, n 6), S1146A ( , n 12), A1420S (OE, n 8), and rbCII (E, n 7) were measured with voltage protocol shown in B-a. Recovery from the inactivation of S1115A (f, n 6), S1146A ( , n 5), A1420S (OE, n 5), and rbCII (E, n 7) were measured with voltage protocol shown in C-a.

D, concentration-dependent block by verapamil of Ca2 channel currents through rbCII and S1115A. Ca2 channel currents of S1115A were blocked to the same degree as that of rbCII (Fig. On the other hand, sensitivity of S1115A to DHP antagonists, such as nitrendipine, at a holding potential of 70 mV was significantly decreased compared with those of rbCII, S1146A, and A1420S (Fig. When holding potential was changed to 50 from 70 mV, nitrendipine block of S1115A Critical Determinant of Action of DHP Agonists 41507 FIG. A, representative current traces of rbCII (a), S1115A (b), S1146A (c), and A1420S (d) elicited by a 100-ms test pulse to 0 mV at 0.1 Hz. C, concentration-response curve for nitrendipine of rbCII and S1115A. The IC50 value for S1115A and S1115T are 57.5 and 25 times higher than that of rbCII, respectively. D, representative current traces of rbCII (a) and S1115A (b). E, inhibition by R-( )-Bay K 8644 of Ca2 hannel current through rbCII and S1115A. The concentration-response curve for the nitrendipine block of Ca2 channel currents was shifted to the right by 57.5-fold in S1115A (IC50 values: 7.8 10 7 M (rbCII) versus 4.5 10 5 M (S1115A), Fig. The affinity for ( )-isradipine was also reduced by 24.1-fold (IC50 values at 60 mV: 3.7 1 0 7 M (rbCII) versus 8.9 10 6 M (S1115A), (n 3), data not c shown). In S1115A, R-( )-Bay K 8644, a stereoisomer of Ca2 hannel agonist S-( )-Bay K 8644 (18, 19), again, produced significantly smaller block of Ca2 channel currents than in rbCII (Fig. Thus, S1115A was significantly less sensitive to DHP antagonists. However, S1115A was not enhanced at all. This result was against our expectation that S-( )-Bay K 8644 would produce smaller enhancement of Ca2 channel currents in S1115A than in rbCII as was the case with the Ca2 channel block produced by R-( )-Bay K 8644 (Fig. Ca2 channel currents of S1115A were rather slightly decreased by S-( )-Bay K 8644 (1 M) (98.6 3.45% of control) to the same degree as time control (92.9 2.15% of control at 90 s, data not shown). Another DHP Ca2 channel agonist, Bay Y 5959 (20), also did not enhance the Ca2 channel current of S1115A, but rather slightly decreased it in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. These results demonstrate that S1115A is insensitive to DHP Ca2 channel agonists. Thus we verified whether S1115A lacks the sensitivity to only DHP Ca2 channel agonists or c Ca2 channel agonists generally. Ca2 channel currents of S1115A were slightly enhanced by FPL-64176 (1 M), unlike the results with S-( )-Bay K 8644 or Bay Y 5959. However, the enhancement of Ca2 channel currents through S1115A were markedly smaller than that of rbCII (Fig. Because Ser1115 is located only three amino acids away from Glu1118, which is the determinant of Ca2 selectivity of the 1C subunit, the sensitivity of S1115A for DHPs may be affected by charge carriers. The IC50 value of S1115T was 1.9 10 5 M, which was higher than that of rbCII by a factor of 25 but lower than that of S1115A by 2.3-fold (Fig. Comparison of Unitary Ca2 Channel Currents between rbCII and S1115A--Single Ca2 channel activity was recorded in cell-attached patch-clamp mode. 0.009930.138 by S-( )Bay K 8644, 0.024430.828 by FPL-64176), but only slightly modified in S1115A (0.029830.0538, 0.0073130.0132, by S-( )-Bay K 8644 and FPL-64176, respectively (Fig. Open-time histograms of rbCII and S1115A with and without S-( )-Bay K 8644 are shown in Fig. The mean open time of rbCII was also increased by S-( )-Bay K 8644 in rbCII but unchanged in S1115A (mean open time in ms: 1.60 1.93 3 3.26 3.23, 2.07 3.46 3 2.24 3.36, respectively). These results indicate that prolongation of Ca2 channel opening by Ca2 channel agonists is mostly absent in S1115A. A, representative current traces of rbCII (a), S1115A (b), S1146A (c), and A1420S (d) elicited by a 100-ms test pulse to 0 mV from a holding potential of 70 mV at 0.1 Hz.

Pharmacological Properties of S1115A--IC50 values of the Ca2 channel block produced by nitrendipine was higher in S1115A by 57.5-fold than in rbCII. Another DHP Ca2 channel antagonist, R-( )-Bay K 8644, also produced significantly smaller block in S1115A than in rbCII (Fig. In the present study, the affinity of ( )-isradipine for S1115A was also lower than that of rbCII by 24-fold. In contrast, the Ca2 channel currents of S1115A were inhibited by dilti- azem and verapamil in the same way as that of rbCII (Fig. Unexpectedly, Ca2 channel currents of S1115A were insensitive to DHP Ca2 channel agonists and rather slightly decreased by S-( )-Bay K 8644 (Fig. However, effects of both chemical compounds were not linearly altered in S1115A: antagonistic effects of R-( )-Bay K 8644 were reduced, but agonistic effects of S-( )-Bay K 8644 were completely eliminated. Even higher concentration (3 M) of S-( )-Bay K 8644, a concentration more than 300 times higher than EC50 value of S-( )-Bay K 8644 ( 10 nM), did not enhance Ca2 channel currents of S1115A (data not shown). Indeed, Ca2 channel currents of S1115A were also rather slightly inhibited by another DHP Ca2 channel agonist, Bay Y 5959, regardless of concentration (Fig. In contrast, the benzoylpyrrole (non-DHP) Ca2 channel agonist, FPL-64176, slightly enhanced Ca2 channel currents of S1115A, but the effect was significantly smaller than that of rbCII (Fig. A, single channel recording of rbCII (a) and S1115A (b) before (left) and after (right) application of S-( )-Bay K 8644 (1 M) or FPL-64176 (10 M). Unitary currents through rbCII were strongly enhanced by Ca2 channel agonists but not in S1115A. Therefore, different voltages were used as test pulses in rbCII ( 20 mV) and S1115A ( 10, 0 mV) to optimize the recording condition. B, mean open time distributions for rbCII and S1115A with and without S-( )-Bay K 8644. Mean open time of rb7 II was increased (1.60 C 1.93 ms (n 5) 3 3.26 3.23 ms (n 623)), whereas it was unchanged in S1115A (2.07 3.46 ms (n 64) 3 2.24 3.36 ms (n 210)). The single-channel study clearly showed that, in S1115A, c2c Ca hannel agonists (or DHP agonist) failed to prolong Ca2 hannel opening. 7A), although the whole-cell Ca2 channel current of S1115A was not increased at all (Fig. These somewhat contradictory results may be explained as follows: 1) in whole-cell recording, natural run-down of the Ca2 channel current may have masked the slight enhancement of S1115A by S-( )-Bay K 8644 and resulted in the slight decrease of the current, because S-( )-Bay K 8644 reduced the Ca2 channel current to a degree similar to a that of time control; 2) the difference of charge carrier (Ca2 nd Ba2 ) may influence the effects of S-( )-Bay K 8644, because Ser1115 is located near a Ca2 -selective filter (Glu1118). However, the latter possibility is unlikely, because effects of S-( )-Bay K 8644 on whole-cell Ca2 channel currents were the same in rbCII and S1115A whether the charge carrier was Ca2 (2 mM) or Ba2 (2 mM) (data not shown). Considering that electrophysiological properties of S1115A were identical to those of rbCII, Ser1115 appears to be a critical amino acid that links the binding of DHP agonists and the modulation of Ca2 channel gating, which is not a result of modulation of Ca2 channel activation (36, 37) nor inactivation (34, 38) but rather may be the result of direct stabilization of the Ca2 channel pore in the open state. When S1115 was replaced by other amino acids (S1115D, S1115T, or S1115V), only S1115T was slightly sensitive to S-( )-Bay K 8644. Replacement by valine (S1115V) or aspartic acid (S1115D) abolished the effect of S-( )-Bay K 8644 (1 M).

11382756	This is consistent with the finding that the mutation A1741E (in rat brain II, corresponding to A1529E in 1) was blocked by Ca2 (IC50 119 M), and no permeation of Ca2 or Ba2 was detected (36). The mutant -conotoxin GIIIA R13Q ( -CTX R13Q) was synthesized by solid state synthesis on a polystyrene-based Rink amide resin on an Applied Biosystems 431A synthesizer, as described previously (26). Following folding of the peptide by air oxidation, -CTX R13Q was purified to near homogeneity by HPLC. This hypothesis was supported by the observation that binding of the mutated -conotoxin GIIIA R13Q to the outer channel pore dramatically reduced the likelihood of DIIIK1237E channels entering ultra-slow inactivation. One explanation for this effect was that binding of -CTX R13Q to the outer channel vestibule protected channels from entry to ultraslow inactivation by physical hindrance of the underlying conformational change of the outer channel vestibule. Assessment of channel gating kinetics in the toxin-bound state was possible because -CTX R13Q only partially occludes the outer vestibule, resulting in a residual current of about 2530% of that in control (35). We tested whether -CTX R13Q reduced the likelihood of DIV-A1529D channels to enter the ultra-slow inactivated state, as has been demonstrated with DIII-K1237E channels. The currents were assessed during control and during superfusion with 27 M -CTX R13Q. Binding of -CTX R13Q substantially reduced the amount of ultra-slow recovery from inactivation. The time constants of recovery from ultra-slow inactivation ( 2) were 120.4 4.0 and 94.1 11.2 s (p 0.05; n 6 for each measurement) during control and during superfusion with -CTX R13Q, respectively. -CTX R13Q also reduced the amplitudes of recovery from ultra-slow inactivation (A2; control: 0.76 0.02; -CTX R13Q: 0.47 0.09; p 0.05). Thus, -CTX R13Q reduced both the time constant and the amplitude of ultra-slow inactivation. These results suggest that binding of -CTX R13Q protects a fraction of channels from entry to ultra-slow inactivation in DIV-A1529D as well as in DIII-K1237E. However, -CTX R13Q has been shown to shift voltage-dependent channel gating, perhaps by an electrostatic effect on the voltage sensors (35). To test whether the reduction of ultra-slow inactivation by -CTX R13Q may have resulted from a voltage shift of ultraslow inactivation, we investigated the effect of -CTX R13Q on the voltage dependence of ultra-slow inactivation. 6B, -CTX R13Q reduced ultra-slow inactivation over the voltage range where ultra-slow inactivation was maximal, i.e. -CTX R13Q may act as a "splint in the vestibule," thereby preventing channels from entry to the ultra-slow inactivated state. A, recovery from ultra-slow inactivation was examined during a toxin-free control (solid squares) and during superfusion with 27 M -CTX R13Q (open squares). Clearly, superfusion with -CTX R13Q substantially speeded recovery from ultra-slow inactivation. B, -CTX R13Q (27 M, open squares) substantially raised the nadir of U-shaped voltage dependence of ultra-slow inactivation in DIV-A1529D (control, solid squares). -CTX R13Q Interferes with Ultra-slow Inactivation in DIVA1529D--Na channel block by -CTX R13Q is incomplete, leaving residual single channel current, which allows the examination of channel gating in the blocked state (6, 35, 54, 55). Recently, we presented evidence that -CTX R13Q is capable of destabilizing the ultra-slow inactivated state by a mechanism unrelated to simple electrostatic interaction with the gating process (6), suggesting that -CTX R13Q interacted with the outer channel vestibule in a way that prevented ultraslow inactivation. We proposed that ultra-slow inactivation most likely reflected a rearrangement of the outer pore, similar to C-type inactivation in voltage-gated K channels and that binding of -CTX R13Q to the outer pore stabilized the structure of the outer vestibule, thereby protecting channels from ultra-slow inactivation. In the present study ultra-slow inactivation in DIV-A1529D was substantially reduced when -CTX R13Q was bound to the outer vestibule. 6B, superfusion with -CTX R13Q did not result in a shift of the voltage dependence of ultra-slow inactivation, but the U-shaped dependence on prepulse voltage appeared blunted relative to the unblocked state. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the reduction of ultra-slow inactivation by -CTX R13Q did not result from electrostatic interaction with the voltage-sensing channel structures, but most likely resulted from an impediment of entry to the ultra-slow inactivated state, similar to the interaction of -CTX R13Q with DIII-K1237E (6). The molecular mechanism of the protection from ultra-slow inactivation by -CTX R13Q remains to be elucidated. In theory, a part of -CTX R13Q protruding into the outer pore could act as a splint in the vestibule, preventing a pore collapse as the molecular event underlying ultra-slow inactivation. Denis McMaster (Peptide Synthesis Laboratory, University of Calgary Faculty of Medicine) for providing the peptide, -CTX R13Q. The finding that the charge conserving mutation K1237R was not associated with substantial amounts of ultra-slow inactivation (6) despite having dramatic effects on ionic selectivity (22) supported the idea that some kind of structural effect of the mutation was the basis for the enhanced likelihood of entry to ultra-slow inactivation. The voltage dependence of ultra-slow inactivation in DIV-A1529D is U-shaped, with a local maximum near 60 mV, whereas activation is maximal only above 20 mV. These data suggest that ultra-slow inactivation emanates from "partially activated" closed states and that the P-loop in DIV may undergo a conformational change during channel activation, which is accentuated by DIV-A1529D. We have shown previously that the mutations 1-DIIIK1237E1 and 1-DIV-A1529D favor entry to the ultra-slow inactivated state (6, 16). In the present study we explore in detail the pro1 27831 27832 Sodium Channel Selectivity Filter and Activation A2 S 1 perties of ultra-slow inactivation in the mutant DIV-A1529D. We find that ultra-slow inactivation in DIV-A1529D has a U-shaped voltage dependence. It can be induced more efficiently by depolarizing voltage trains, suggesting that ultraslow inactivation in DIV-A1529D occurs from intermediate closed states that are occupied on the way to the open state. RESULTS Mutagenesis of the 1--The oligonucleotide-directed point mutation A1529D was introduced using four primer polymerase chain reaction. To test for Ca2 permeation in DIV-A1529D oocytes were bathed in the following solution: 85 mM CaCl2, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES-Ca(OH)2, pH 7.2. Recovery from Ultra-slow Inactivation in 1 and DIVA1529D--DIV-A1529D shows a slowly recovering component of inactivation. 1A shows the growth of inward currents through DIV-A1529D channels with subsequent pulses at 20-s intervals. DIV-A1529D shows a larger component of a slowly recovering current in comparison with 1. 1B summarizes the time course of recovery from inactivation, produced by a 300-s depolarizing prepulse to 50 mV in native 1 and in constructs with the mutation DIV-A1529D (n 6 for each data point). Clearly, wild type 1 currents recovered completely within 50 s, whereas the time course of recovery of DIV-A1529D channels was substantially slower. Recovery from slow inactivation had a mean time constant of 7.9 1.3 and 7.1 1.4 s in 1 and DIV-A1529D, respectively. The corresponding amplitudes were 0.58 0.04 in 1 and 0.35 0.02 in DIV-A1529D (p 0.01). Time constants of recovery from ultra-slow inactivation were 78.4 19.8 s in 1 and 110.9 11.5 s in DIV-A1529D. The amplitudes were 0.22 0.02 in 1 and 0.62 0.04 in DIV-A1529D (p 0.01). Thus, significantly more channels recovered from ultra-slow inactivation in DIV-A1529D than in 1. Development of Ultra-slow Inactivation in DIV-A1529D--To determine the time course of development of ultra-slow inactivation in DIV-A1529D, prepulses to 50 mV of variable duration were applied from a holding potential of 120 mV, and the time course of recovery at 120 mV was monitored for each prepulse duration by subsequent 30-ms test pulses to 10 mV at 20-s intervals. Thus, both entry to and exit from ultra-slow inactivation in DIV-A1529D channels had time constants similar to those previously found in DIII-K1237E channels (6). Coexpression of DIV-A1529D with the Rat Brain 1 Subunit--Coexpression of the 1 subunit with the subunit of the 1 Na channel speeds current decay and accelerates recovery from fast and slow inactivation (6, 2730). Ultra-slow inactivation in DIV-A1529D. A, growth of inward current during recovery from ultra-slow inactivation in DIV-A1529D channels. B, comparison of the time courses of recovery from inactivation, produced by a 300-s depolarizing prepulse to 50 mV in native 1 (filled circles) and in DIV-A1529D (filled squares; n 6 for each data point). Recovery was substantially slower in DIV-A1529D channels than in wild type 1. C, the time course of development of ultra-slow inactivation in DIV-A1529D. D, growth of inward current during recovery from ultra-slow inactivation in DIV-A1529D, coexpressed with the rat brain 1 subunit. The time constant of the slower component representing recovery from ultra-slow inactivation was 130 s, which is similar to the mean value for DIV-A1529D only channels (110.9 11.5 s; see text). F, comparison of the amplitude of ultra-slow inactivation in DIV-A1529D 1 channels following inactivating prepulses to 50 mV. This amplitude was similar to the amplitude of ultra-slow inactivation in DIV-A1529D alone channels, following prepulses of 300-s duration. We found that, compared with DIV-A1529D alone, longer prepulse durations were required to drive DIV-A1529D 1 channels into ultra-slow inactivation. 1 (D and E) shows the time course of recovery of DIVA1529D 1 channels from ultra-slow inactivation produced by a 1200-s inactivating prepulse to 50 mV. Note that the prepulse duration was four times as long as in the experiment with DIV-A1529D alone, shown in Fig. Inward currents during recovery of DIV-A1529D 1 were slowly increasing, suggesting that the channels recovered from ultra-slow inactivation. However, the time course of recovery from ultraslow inactivation of DIV-A1529D 1 was similar to that of alone (Fig. 1F shows that DIV-A1529 increasing the prepulse duration from 300 to 1200 s significantly increased the fraction of DIV-A1529D 1 channels recovering from ultra-slow inactivation. In contrast, entry into alone ultra-slow inactivation at 50 mV in DIV-A1529D channels was completed after 300 s (Fig. Thus, coexpres- sion of DIV-A1529D with the 1 subunit did not abolish ultra-slow inactivation but delayed entry into the ultra-slow inactivated state. To examine the voltage dependence of ultra-slow inactivation in DIV-A1529D, the oocytes were depolarized for 300 s from 120 mV to prepulse voltages in the range of 90 mV to 30 mV. Voltage dependence of ultraslow inactivation in DIV-A1529D and DIV-A1529D 1. Inset, Current-voltage relationship in DIV-A1529D, determined by 20-ms test pulses to the indicated potentials, from a holding potential of 120 mV (open squares). 1F, coexpression of the 1 subunit with slowed entry into the ultra-slow inactivated DIV-A1529D state. Hence, the fraction of DIV-A1529D 1 channels that had entered the ultra-slow inactivated state after a prepulse duration of 300 s was smaller than if only the subunit was expressed. However, the voltage dependence of ultra-slow inactivation of DIV-A1529D 1 channels was similar to DIVA1529D alone, exhibiting a U shape with minimum availability at -60 mV (Fig. Because entry into ultra-slow inactivation was faster in DIVA1529D alone channels, further experiments were performed without coexpression of 1. To test for Ca2 urrent-dependent inactivation, oocytes expressing DIVA1529D channels were bathed in a high Ca2 solution (85 mM CaCl2; see "Experimental Procedures"). Upon exchange of the standard 90 mM Na with the high Ca2 solution, all inward current was lost, indicating a lack of measurable permeation of Ca2 ions through DIV-A1529D channels. This argues against Ca2 current-dependent inactivation in DIV-A1529D channels. 2, maximum inward current in DIV-A1529D occurred at potentials positive to 20 mV, whereas Fnoninactivating was minimal at approximately 60 mV. Voltage Dependence of Na Channel Availability Following Brief Conditioning Prepulses--Given the U-shaped voltage dependence of ultra-slow inactivation, it was important to deter- mine whether other inactivated states in DIV-A1529D also had nonmonotonic dependence on prepulse voltage. Both in wild type 1 and in DIV-A1529D channel availability after 1-s conditioning prepulses decreased monotonically with depolarization, asymptotically approaching zero at potentials positive to 40 mV. The absence of U-shaped voltage dependence of inactivation produced by a 1-s prepulse suggested that the ultra-slow inactivated state in DIV-A1529D was unlikely to be connected to those inactivated states that were produced by 1-s conditioning prepulses. Thus, we sought to explore whether conditioning prepulses of 1-s duration would be able to recruit a minimum number of three distinct states of inactivation in DIV-A1529D and, if so, whether any one of these states had a nonmonotonic voltage dependence similar to ultra-slow inactivation. Therefore, we examined the time course of recovery of DIV-A1529D channels after a 1-s conditioning prepulse to 50 mV (i.e. 4 the time course of recovery in DIV-A1529D was adequately fitted with three exponential decay functions (Equation 2), suggesting the presence of at least three inactivation processes (1). This result indicates that within the range of examined prepulse voltages, the mutation DIV-A1529D did not affect the voltage dependence of inactivated states produced by brief prepulse durations. Ultra-slow Inactivation in DIV-A1529D Is Favored by Pulse Trains--The fact that inactivation produced by 1-s prepulses did not exhibit U-shaped voltage dependence argues against a serial Markovian kinetic scheme, where ultra-slow inactivation Sodium Channel Selectivity Filter and Activation 27835 FIG. Both in wild type 1 and in DIV-A1529D channel availability decreased monotonically with depolarization, reaching a minimum at potentials positive to 40 mV. Time course of recovery from a 1-s conditioning prepulse in DIV-A1529D. DIV-A1529D channels were inactivated by a 6-s conditioning prepulse to 10 mV (A, n 11) and to 50 mV (B, n 1 ). Molecular Mechanism of Ultra-slow Inactivation in DIVA1529D--Previously, we have reported that the mutation DIIIK1237E in 1 enhanced the probability of entry to ultra-slow inactivation (6). We tested whether -CTX R13Q reduced the likelihood of DIV-A1529D channels to enter the ultra-slow inactivated state, as has been demonstrated with DIII-K1237E channels. 6A shows the time course of recovery of DIV-A1529D channels from a 300-s prepulse to 50 mV. These results suggest that binding of -CTX R13Q protects a fraction of channels from entry to ultra-slow inactivation in DIV-A1529D as well as in DIII-K1237E. Ultra-slow inactivation in DIV-A1529D can be produced by a pulse train. Ultra-slow inactivation may occur from closed states that have a high prob- The major findings of the present study are: (i) the mutation DIV-A1529D in 1 increased the propensity of Na channels to enter an ultra-slow inactivated state, (ii) the voltage depend- Sodium Channel Selectivity Filter and Activation 27837 FIG. Recovery from ultra-slow inactivation in DIV-A1529D is modulated by a mutant -conotoxin known to bind at the outer vestibule. B, -CTX R13Q (27 M, open squares) substantially raised the nadir of U-shaped voltage dependence of ultra-slow inactivation in DIV-A1529D (control, solid squares). The present study adds further support to the latter contention because we were able to demonstrate that substantial amounts of ultra-slow inactivation can be recruited by the mutation DIV-A1529D. The fact that ultra-slow inactivation can be observed in a mutant with severely altered permeation properties (DIII-K1237E) and in a mutant with highly preserved permeation properties (DIVA1529D) argues against the notion that the disruption of ionic selectivity forms the basis of ultra-slow inactivation. Origin of U-shaped Inactivation--One of the unexpected findings of the present study was that the voltage dependence of ultra-slow inactivation in DIV-A1529D was U-shaped, whereas ultra-slow inactivation in DIII-K1237E had a monotonic dependence on prepulse voltage (Fig. In case of the mutant DIV-A1529D Ca2 current-dependent inactivation seems unlikely because we were unable to detect Ca2 permeation when the oocytes were bathed in a solution containing 85 mM Ca2 . Thus, BTX-modified channels share a number of properties with channels carrying the mutation DIVA1529D. In the present study, we found that DIV-A1529D channels could be driven into ultra-slow inactivation by repetitive brief depolarizations. Hence, DIV-A1529D channels are most likely to undergo ultra-slow inactivation at the voltage range of 60 to 50 mV because this voltage range has the highest probability to accumulate intermediate closed states, which may provide a pathway for entry to the ultra-slow inactivated state. -CTX R13Q Interferes with Ultra-slow Inactivation in DIVA1529D--Na channel block by -CTX R13Q is incomplete, leaving residual single channel current, which allows the examination of channel gating in the blocked state (6, 35, 54, 55). In the present study ultra-slow inactivation in DIV-A1529D was substantially reduced when -CTX R13Q was bound to the outer vestibule. The Outer Vestibule of the Na Channel May Be Involved in Activation Gating--For DIV-A1529D the dynamic rearrangement of the pore, which most likely forms the basis of ultraslow inactivation is preferentially reached through intermediate closed states, on the way to the open state of the channel. The mutation DIV-A1529D may interfere with this complex rearrangement prior to channel opening. As a result the outer channel vestibule undergoes a dynamic rearrangement that forms the basis of the propensity of DIV-A1529D to enter the ultra-slow inactivated state at voltages near the threshold for channel opening, thus accounting for the U-shaped voltage dependence of ultra-slow inactivation. We have shown previously that the mutations 1-DIIIK1237E1 and 1-DIV-A1529D favor entry to the ultra-slow inactivated state (6, 16). Thus, both entry to and exit from ultra-slow inactivation in DIV-A1529D channels had time constants similar to those previously found in DIII-K1237E channels (6). Molecular Mechanism of Ultra-slow Inactivation in DIVA1529D--Previously, we have reported that the mutation DIIIK1237E in 1 enhanced the probability of entry to ultra-slow inactivation (6). This hypothesis was supported by the observation that binding of the mutated -conotoxin GIIIA R13Q to the outer channel pore dramatically reduced the likelihood of DIIIK1237E channels entering ultra-slow inactivation. We tested whether -CTX R13Q reduced the likelihood of DIV-A1529D channels to enter the ultra-slow inactivated state, as has been demonstrated with DIII-K1237E channels. These results suggest that binding of -CTX R13Q protects a fraction of channels from entry to ultra-slow inactivation in DIV-A1529D as well as in DIII-K1237E. The fact that ultra-slow inactivation can be observed in a mutant with severely altered permeation properties (DIII-K1237E) and in a mutant with highly preserved permeation properties (DIVA1529D) argues against the notion that the disruption of ionic selectivity forms the basis of ultra-slow inactivation. Origin of U-shaped Inactivation--One of the unexpected findings of the present study was that the voltage dependence of ultra-slow inactivation in DIV-A1529D was U-shaped, whereas ultra-slow inactivation in DIII-K1237E had a monotonic dependence on prepulse voltage (Fig. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the reduction of ultra-slow inactivation by -CTX R13Q did not result from electrostatic interaction with the voltage-sensing channel structures, but most likely resulted from an impediment of entry to the ultra-slow inactivated state, similar to the interaction of -CTX R13Q with DIII-K1237E (6). In yet another report the mutation A1529C did not exhibit Ca2 permeability (37). This is consistent with the finding that the mutation A1741E (in rat brain II, corresponding to A1529E in 1) was blocked by Ca2 (IC50 119 M), and no permeation of Ca2 or Ba2 was detected (36).

Results dSlo and dSlo T290E, were functionally expressed in COS-7 cells and reconstituted into lipid bilayers. A typical single channel conductance of 264 pS and 267 pS was observed for dSlo and dSlo T290E, respectively (Fig. Although only one distribution of the voltage dependence is displayed for a typical dSlo and dSlo T290E channel, both the calcium and voltage sensitivity varied from channel to channel. This is seen with all the clones tested (dSlo, dSlo T290E, and hSlo ). We were able to resolve two exponents to describe the distribution of the shut times and one exponent to describe the open times for dSlo and dSlo T290E. The average shut time rate constants 9 SEM, were: ~c1 = 0.472 ms 9 0.081, ~c2 = 8.08 ms 9 0.58, for dSlo, and ~c1 = 0.509 ms 9 0.062, ~c2 = 9.41 ms 9 2.38 for dSlo T290E, respectively (see Table 1). The distribution of the open dwell times were well described by a single exponent, 12.0 9 5.3 ms for dSlo, and 11.7 9 2.0 ms for dSlo T290E. Therefore, the T290E mutation had no effect on gating of the channel. The kinetics of dSlo and dSlo T290E were stable in our lipid bilayer preparation over several minutes of recording.

Addition of CTX to the external side of the dSlo T290E mutant channel resulted in a dramatic change in its block by CTX when compared to the wild type dSlo channel (Fig. In contrast, the block of dSlo T290E displayed closings on the order of a few seconds, with an average time constant of 5 s.

11773240	This current was not affected by a mutation in the selectivity filter (HCN2 G404S), extracellular perfusion of Cs , or a mutation in the S4 segment (S306Q) unlike If, which was reduced or eliminated by these mutations as well as by Cs (14). The same staining pattern has been previously shown for wild-type HCN2, HCN2 S306Q (a mutation in the S4 segment), and HCN2 G404S (a mutation in the selectivity filter), which traffic to the plasma membrane. This current was not affected by a mutation in the selectivity filter (HCN2 G404S), extracellular perfusion of Cs , or a mutation in the S4 segment (S306Q) unlike If, which was reduced or eliminated by these mutations as well as by Cs (14). The same staining pattern has been previously shown for wild-type HCN2, HCN2 S306Q (a mutation in the S4 segment), and HCN2 G404S (a mutation in the selectivity filter), which traffic to the plasma membrane. Here we found that a mutation in the S4-S5 linker of HCN2 (Y331D) produced an additional mixed cationic instantaneous current. Together with a concomitant reduction in If , the data suggest that the Y331D mutation disrupted channel closing placing the channel in a "If -like," and not an "Iinst-like," state. Here, we found that Y331D up-regulated an instantaneous current when expressed in CHO cells, but its properties were more like If than like Iinst. Together, the data support the idea that the Y331D mutation disrupted channel closing through local allosteric effects on the activation gate (S6 segment) and/or on the voltage-sensing elements. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES 16833 Mutagenesis and Expression--The Y331D mutant was constructed by overlapping PCR mutagenesis from a mouse HCN2 template as previously described (14). In order to determine the voltage dependence of block by Cs of instantaneous current in cells expressing HCN2 Y331D (15), the following equation was used, I Cs I 1 k o/[Cs])exp To assess rates of If activation and deactivation, time constants were generated using a single exponential fitting procedure. 1 ) where I and ICs represent the HCN2 Y331D instantaneous current in control conditions and after Cs , [Cs] is Cs concentration (2 mM), ko is the dissociation constant of Cs binding to the block site at zero voltage, and is the "electrical" distance of the block site from the external membrane surface. The voltage dependence of activation for HCN2 and HCN2 Y331D were determined by tail currents generated at 30 mV (see Fig. A Mutation in the S4-S5 Linker of HCN2 (Y331D) Up-regulates a Mixed Cationic "Instantaneous" Current and Reduces If--In order to examine whether the S4-S5 linker was involved in producing the Iinst associated with wild-type HCN2, we mutated the tyrosine at position 331 to aspartic acid (Y331D) in mouse HCN2 and expressed both the mutant and wild-type channels in CHO cells. The largest effects were produced by a mutation of this tyrosine to aspartic acid (Y331D). We anticipated three possible scenarios upon transfection of HCN2 Y331D in CHO cells. Based on the possibility that Iinst results from a leaky closed state, we hypothesized that the Y331D mutation would increase Iinst and thus that this current would be significantly up-regulated by the mutation, insensitive to Cs , approximately linear with ( respect to changes in voltage and carried by Na and K 11, 14). A comparison of the S3 segment, the S4 segment, and the S4-S5 linker among mouse HCN1 and HCN2, sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) HCN, and the recently crystallized KvAP (16) shows the position of the HCN2 Y331D mutation (Fig. Using the whole-cell patch clamp approach, we determined the densities of If and instantaneous currents recorded from cells expressing wild-type HCN2 and HCN2 Y331D in order to control for variability in cell surface area. Cells expressing HCN2 Y331D produced significantly less If 16834 Instantaneous and Slow Gating Elements in HCN Channels FIG. The asterisk shows the mHCN2 residue mutated in this study (Y331D). The increase in instantaneous current in cells expressing HCN2 Y331D is apparent in I-V curves generated at each of three varying concentrations of extracellular K or Na examined (Figs. The increase in instantaneous current amplitude due only to the Y331D mutation is shown in I-V curves that represent the difference in instantaneous currents between cells expressing HCN2 and HCN2 Y331D (Figs. The reversal potentials for instantaneous currents at each concentration and the movement of the reversal potentials to more positive potentials at increasing concentrations of external K or Na , are consistent with the mixed cationic nature of instantaneous current in cells expressing HCN2 that we described previously (Iinst) as well as with the up-regulated instantaneous current in cells expressing HCN2 Y331D. Interestingly, the I-V curves for Iinst in cells expressing wildtype HCN2 were linear, whereas the I-V curves for the instantaneous current in cells expressing HCN2 Y331D rectified in a the inward direction especially at the elevated extracellular K nd Na concentrations. Inward rectification of instantaneous currents was also observed in experiments in Xenopus oocytes expressing HCN2 Y331D (10). The rectification suggested that the mixed cation instantaneous currents in cells expressing HCN2 Y331D and HCN2 were different. Overall, the results suggested that the up-regulated instantaneous currents we observed in cells expressing HCN2 Y331D had similarities to both If and Iinst. HCN2 Y331D Is Expressed on the Cell Surface of CHO Cells in Significant Amounts--The large decrease in If in cells expressing Y331D may have reflected a decrease in the total amount of protein expressed in the cell and/or localized to the plasma membrane. The pattern of fluorescence observed is consistent with the idea that the large instantaneous currents recorded in these cells were due to HCN2 Y331D and that the large reduction of If in cells expressing HCN2 Y331D was not due to a low level of HCN2 protein in the cell or on the plasma membrane. Instantaneous Currents Associated with HCN2 Y331D Are Sensitive to External Cs in a Voltage-dependent Manner--In cells expressing HCN2, Iinst is not sensitive to Cs , whereas If is sensitive to Cs (11); the ability of Cs to block If increases at more negative potentials and occurs only when If is inward (15, 17, 18). In order to determine whether the instantaneous currents up-regulated by the Y331D mutation were more like If or Iinst, we examined the sensitivity of instantaneous currents to Cs in cells expressing HCN2 Y331D. We found that, in addition to blocking If, Cs dramatically reduced instantaneous currents in cells expressing HCN2 Y331D, whereas in cells expressing HCN2, If was blocked but Iinst was not affected (Fig. 5B, there was no effect of Cs on outward instantaneous currents recorded from cells expressing HCN2 Y331D. However, Cs did block inward, but not outward, instantaneous currents recorded from cells expressing HCN2 Y331D, and the block was greater at more negative voltages. Thus, the key characteristics of Cs block of If were manifested by the Cs block of a proportion of instantaneous currents recorded from cells expressing HCN2 Y331D. This is consistent with the idea that the up-regulated instantaneous currents observed in cells expressing HCN2 Y331D were due to an "If-like" instantaneous current and not an "Iinst-like" instantaneous current. 2E and 3E, the amplitude of instantaneous currents measured in cells expressing HCN2 was subtracted from the amplitude of instantaneous currents measured in cells expressing HCN2 Y331D in order to remove the contribution of instantaneous current due to HCN2 (Cs -insensitive Iinst). This calculation is reasonable because the amplitude of Cs -insensitive instantaneous current was not significantly different between cells expressing HCN2 and HCN2 Y331D at 150 mV (see instantaneous currents in Fig. At 150 mV, Cs blocks If almost completely in cells expressing either HCN2 or HCN2 Y331D (Fig. Instantaneous currents in CHO cells expressing HCN2 or HCN2 Y331D are permeable to K but differ in amplitude.

Note the parallel reduction in HCN2 Iinst, HCN2 Y331D instantaneous currents, and If as the current carrying ion K is lowered from 30K to 15K to 5.4K in both HCN2 and HCN2 Y331D.

Confocal images of cells expressing HCN2 Y331D show protein on the cell surface. was larger in cells expressing HCN2 Y331D (If Cs -sensitive instantaneous current) than in cells expressing HCN2 (If only) (Fig. The larger Cs -sensitive current in cells expressing HCN2 Y331D suggests some effect of the mutation on maximal conductance, since the channels are fully activated at 150 mV (see Fig. We found that Iinst associated with HCN2 Y331D was not significantly larger than Iinst associated with HCN2, which implies a difference in single channel conductance or open probability. To examine the voltage dependence of block of instantaneous current by Cs in cells expressing Y331D according to this model, we plotted the percentage of current blocked (calculated from Fig. Together, the data strongly suggest that the block of instantaneous current by 2 mM Cs was complete at the more negative voltages and that the unblocked instantaneous current at 150 mV reflected Iinst in cells expressing HCN2 Y331D. According to the fitting, our data suggest that Cs ions cross 0.87 of the membrane electrical thickness ( ) before reaching the binding site in HCN2 Y331D channels. The ko and for the mutant and wild-type channel were approximately the same, indicating that the Y331D mutation did not affect the affinity or location of the Cs binding site in the pore. The Y331D Mutation Disrupts Channel Closing and Destabilizes the Closed State--The above experiments support the suggestion that a fraction of If is already activated by the Y331D mutation, thus producing an instantaneous current in addition to Iinst and If. 7B) and Y331D (Fig. The If-like instantaneous current was determined from the difference in instantaneous currents between cells expressing HCN2 Y331D and HCN2 (Fig. The fully activated If and the If-like instantaneous current were added to yield the total fully activated If for HCN2 Y331D (Fig. This is very close to the reversal potential of fully activated If determined from cells expressing wild-type HCN2 (10.1 3.4 mV, n 5 cells) recorded under identical conditions and suggests that Y331D did not affect selectivity of Na and K (both relations are plotted in Fig. 7C, we then determined the ratio of the If-like instantaneous current to the total fully activated If as a function of voltage for HCN2 Y331D (Fig. We found that the activation curves determined from cells expressing HCN2 Y331D were shifted to more positive voltages and were less steep than those determined from cells expressing wild-type HCN2. If began to activate in the range of 40 mV in cells expressing HCN2 Y331D unlike If in cells expressing the wild-type HCN2, which began to activate at much more negative voltages using the same protocol. We also found that the rates of If activation/deactivation were shifted to more positive voltages, as would be expected from a positive shift in the activation curve, but we also found that the rates of deactivation were significantly slowed at more positive voltages by the Y331D mutation (Fig. On the other hand, the rates of If activation were not different between HCN2 Y331D and HCN2 at voltages in the fully activated range ( 120 and 150 mV). Together, the data are consistent with a disruption of channel closing and destabilization of the closed state by the Y331D mutation. The Fraction of If Activated by Y331D Is Modified by the Relative Amounts of External K and Na but Permeation Is Unaffected--When examining the selectivity of the If-like instantaneous current for Na , we found that the amplitude of If (measured at 150 mV) in cells expressing HCN2 Y331D increased when perfused with solutions containing decreasing amounts of external Na while external K was kept constant (Fig. However, the total If (If and If-like instantaneous current) determined from cells expressing HCN2 Y331D did decrease with decreasing amounts of Na (Fig. The instantaneous current in cells expressing HCN2 Y331D is sensitive to Cs .

The instantaneous currents measured for HCN2, HCN2 Cs , and HCN2 Y331D Cs ere not significantly different (single asterisk, p 0.05).

Characteristics of the block of instantaneous current by Cs n cells expressing HCN2 Y331D. B, values of instantaneous current obtained after subtraction of the mean values of instantaneous current (Iinst) in cells expressing HCN2 from the mean values of instantaneous current in cells expressing HCN2 Y331D, before and after block by Cs using the values from Fig. cells expressing wild-type HCN2 decreased from 248.1 to 160.3 pA/pF (to 0.65 times the initial value), whereas the total If in cells expressing HCN2 Y331D decreased from 592.6 to 357.8 pA/pF (to 0.60 times the initial value). These data confirm that the permeation of Na was not affected by the Y331D mutation. When perw fused with solutions containing decreasing amounts of K hile Na was kept constant, we found that both the amplitude of If and the total If (If and If-like instantaneous current) decreased in cells expressing HCN2 Y331D (Fig. When going from 30 to 5.4 mM K , the amplitude of fully activated If in cells expressing wild-type HCN2 decreased from 202.4 to 63.9 pA/pF (to 0.32 times the initial value), whereas the total If in cells expressing HCN2 Y331D decreased from 286.0 to 94.2 pA/pF (to 0.33 times the initial value). These data confirm that the permeation of K was also not affected by the Y331D mutation. Because the changes in total If were similar, the above experiments suggested that it was the relative amplitudes of If and the If-like instantaneous current produced by HCN2 Y331D that was affected and furthermore that these changes were related to changes in both external Na and K . HCN Y331D mutant disrupts closing of HCN channels. B, fully activated HCN2 If (circles, n 5) and total fully activated HCN2 Y331D If (squares, n 5). The total fully activated HCN2 Y331D If was generated by 1) subtracting the instantaneous current obtained in the first current staircase from the current at each test voltage in the second staircase, which yielded the fully activated HCN2 Y331D If (triangles plotted in C); 2) then subtracting the HCN2 Y331D instantaneous measured in the first current staircase from Iinst values for HCN2 obtained in A, which yielded the If-like instantaneous current component (circles plotted in C). These were added to give the total fully activated If for HCN2 Y331D (squares in B and C, reversal potential 9.5 mV, slope 5.5 nS). C, a plot of the If-like instantaneous current (circles), fully activated If (triangles) and the total fully activated If for HCN2 Y331D (squares) versus test voltage. D, a plot of the fractional activation of If for HCN2 Y331D, determined by dividing the If-like instantaneous current (circles in C) by the total fully activated If (squares in C) at each test voltage, versus test voltage. E, representative If traces of HCN2 and HCN2 Y331D measured in a 135 mM K and 5.4 mM Na external solution used for generation of activation curves. F, If activation curves for HCN2 (circles, n 5) and HCN2 Y331D (squares, n 9) generated from tail currents as in E. If activation curves were best fit with a Boltzmann function (see Equation 2), which gave V and inverse slope (k) values of 125.8 2.0 and 9.8 0.6 mV for HCN2 and 98.5 2.1 and 25 3.0 mV for HCN2 Y331D. G, plots of If activation (filled symbols) and deactivation rates (open symbols) versus test voltage for HCN2 (circles) and HCN2 Y331D (squares). Effects of [K ]e/[Na ]e on the fraction of If activated in CHO cells expressing HCN2 Y331D.

DISCUSSION 16843 Y331D Mutation Disrupts Channel Closing--We have shown that the Y331D mutation in the HCN2 S4-S5 linker significantly decreased If and significantly increased a mixed cation instantaneous current. However, the instantaneous current up-regulated by Y331D was sensitive to external Cs , making it more similar to If than Iinst, which was unchanged by the mutation. Therefore, we were able to divide the instantaneous currents measured in cells expressing HCN2 Y331D into three portions: a portion endogenous to CHO cells, a Cs -insensitive portion produced by expression of HCN2 channels (Iinst), and a Cs -sensitive "If-like" portion produced by the Y331D mutation. On the other hand, the rate of If activation at voltages in the fully activated range was not different between cells expressing HCN2 Y331D or wild-type HCN2. These data are consistent with the idea that the Y331D mutation inhibits the closing of the channel and destabilizes the closed state and does not increase the conductance of a leaky closed state. Previous studies suggested a functional and physical uncoupling of the voltage sensor from the activation gate (10, 22), but we think that the Y331D mutation does not physically sever or weaken a link between the voltage-sensing elements and the activation gate. Therefore, it seems unlikely that the Y331D mutation reduced or eliminated coupling between voltage-sensing elements and the activation gate but more likely that this mutation disrupted the closing of the channel. The slowing of If deactivation at depolarized potentials, without any effects on the rates of If activation in the fully activated range, and the shift of channel opening to more positive voltages further support a disruption of channel closing and destabilization of the closed state by Y331D rather than an uncoupling of the voltagesensing elements and the activation gate. We also suspect that the pore is not directly involved in the effect of Y331D for two reasons. First, permeation is unaffected by Y331D. Second, the disruption of closing by Y331D is additive with the effects of [K ]e/[Na ]e on channel closing, which may be due to the effect of cations in the pore (see below). Based on its position, we suspect that the Y331D mutation causes a local allosteric perturbation of the activation gate (S6 segment) and/or of the voltage-sensing elements, which disrupts channel closing. [K ]e/[Na ]e Ratio Further Modifies HCN2 Y331D Channel Closing--An unusual and interesting finding in the present study was a decrease in the proportion of If-like instantaneous current and an increase in the proportion of If in cells expressing HCN2 Y331D when the [K ]e/[Na ]e ratio increased. The effect of [K ]e/[Na ]e also explains the larger proportion of constitutively activated current found previously in Xenopus oocytes expressing HCN2 Y331D, where a value of close to 100% was reported (10). The reduction of current by Cs occurred within 4 5 s in cells expressing HCN2 or HCN2 Y3331D.

HERG was studied here with K75H-MiRP1 and D82N-MiRP1, changes analogous to those associated with disease when carried in MiRP2 and MinK; then R83H-MiRP2 and D90N-MiRP2 were evaluated. Conversely, the D82N change did not interfere with the capacity of MiRP1 to reduce HERG currents or speed deactivation rates. D82NMiRP1 channels showed a mean tail current density of 0.84 0.1 A (Fig. Just as D82N-MiRP1 influenced HERG like wild-type MiRP1 (Fig. (14), D82N-MiRP1 and D90N-MiRP2 suppressed activity like wild-type subunits.

Inherited mutation of aspartate to asparagine (D 3 N) to yield D76N-MinK is linked to cardiac arrhythmia and deafness; the analogs D82N-MiRP1 and D90N-MiRP2 were studied. To assess whether this site was significant to MiRP2 function, D90N-MiRP2 was produced and studied with its skeletal muscle partner Kv3.4. Compared with wild-type MiRP2/ Kv3.4 channels, expression of D90N-MiRP2 reduced outward current density 3- to 4-fold (345 84 and 391 Figure 1. Predicted topology (left) and partial sequences (right) of human MinK, MiRP1, and MiRP2 indicating extracellular (out) N and intracellular (in) C termini; alignment with numbering for MinK shows part of the predicted transmembrane (thick line) and membranefollowing region (thin line) with sites studied boxed in black: K69H (MinK); K75H (MiRP1); R83H (MiRP2) [open square]; D76N (MinK); D82N (MiRP1); D90N (MiRP2) [gray square]. Two observations with macroscopic currents indicated that channels did contain D90N-MiRP2 subunits. First, the slope of the conductance-voltage relationship with D90NMiRP2 was similar to that for wild-type MiRP2 (13 2.0 and 14 1.4, respectively) rather than that for homomeric Kv3.4 channels (22.5 0.6) (Fig. Second, channels with D90N-MiRP2 were blocked by the peptide toxin BDS-II like those containing wild-type MiRP2 (Ki 633 110 and 688 166 nM at 30 mV, respectively, n 4 5 cells), and significantly different from channels formed with Kv3.4 subunits alone, which showed sixfold greater sensitivity to the toxin (99.5 32 nM) (Fig. At the single-channel level, the effects of D76N-MinK on KCNQ1 and D90N-MiRP2 on Kv3.4 were also similar (Fig. 1) D90N-MiRP2 produced a shift in activation voltage such that openings were rare and short-lived at voltages negative to 20 mV (Fig. 2) Mean unitary current amplitude was lowered by D90N-MiRP2 (Fig. 3B, 1.5 0.1 and 2.2 0.1 pA at 60 mV) whereas D90N-MiRP2/Kv3.4 channels showed a single level similar in magnitude to the lower wild-type current level (Fig. D90N-MiRP2/Kv3.4 channels show altered voltage dependence and reduced potassium flux.

Top: wild-type MiRP2/Kv3.4; bottom: D90N-MiRP2/Kv3.4. E) Upper panel: all-points histograms from steady-state wild-type MiRP2/Kv3.4 (dashed) and D90N-MiRP2/Kv3.4 (solid line) single-channels held at 40 mV for 510 min and indicative of Po. Lower panel: dwell-time histogram at 40 mV from single D90N-MiRP2/Kv3.4 channels held at steady state for 510 min; fit to a double exponential function (solid line) using Marquardt least-squares (PSTAT). 3) Analysis of channel gating kinetics revealed that steady-state open probability (Po) at 40 mV for channels with D90N-MiRP2 was 10-fold lower than for wild-type MiRP2/Kv3.4 channels, Po 0.0040 0.0004 and 0.04 0.10, respectively, n 35 patches (Fig. Both wild-type and D90N-MiRP2 channels showed two open state dwell times (Fig. 3E lower); D90N mutation led to shortening of both dwell times and preferential occupancy of the shorter open state. Thus, dwell-time analysis for D90N-MiRP2/Kv3.4 channels suggested open dwell times with time constants ( ) of 0.7 0.3 and 3.9 0.3 ms (weights of 0.37 0.1 and 0.63 0.1, respectively) vs. Although dwell-time statistics for D90N-MiRP2/Kv3.4 channels should be treated with caution due to infrequent openings at this voltage, incorporation of the mutant into the complex was readily appreciated because single Kv3.4 channels demonstrate short-lived dwell times 2 est fit to just a single exponential, as reported ( b .60 0.06 ms) (8). KCNQ1 is similarly affected by D76N-MinK and D90N-MiRP2 Whereas MinK is the `classical' partner for KCNQ1 (5, 6), expression of MiRP2 with KCNQ1 in experimental MiRPs: PROMISCUOUS DISRUPTION OF MULTIPLE CURRENTS cells produces a potassium-selective, voltage-insensitive (leak-type) current (Fig. Here we report that D90N-MiRP2 acts like D76NMinK to alter the voltage dependence and decrease macroscopic current passed by KCNQ1-containing channels. Compared with wild-type MiRP2, D90NMiRP2 decreased macroscopic current density fourfold: mean current at 40 mV was 1.9 0.2 A for channels with D90N-MiRP2 vs. Furthermore, D90N-MiRP2 restored time and voltage dependence to MiRP2/KCNQ1 currents. Thus, wild-type MiRP2/ KCNQ1 channels displayed a linear current-voltage relationship from 120 to 60 mV whereas D90NMiRP2/KCNQ1 channels were well fitted to a Boltzmann function with a V1/2 of 9 3 mV and slope of 24 2, more similar to KCNQ1 channels (V1/2 1 3 mV, slope 23 3) (Fig. The D90N-MiRP2 subunit also acted to decrease the influence of MiRP2/KCNQ1 channels on RMP. The RMP of oocytes expressing only wild-type MiRP2 was not significantly different from control cells whereas expression of MiRP2 and KCNQ1 produced a shift of 72 3 mV, D90N-MiRP2 and KCNQ1 a shift of 36 7 mV, and KCNQ1 alone a 22 2 mV change 393 Figure 4. D90N-MiRP2/KCNQ1 channels show reduced current density and recovery of voltage and time dependence.

Wild-type MiRP2/ Kv3.4 fit with a straight line; Kv3.4 and D90N-MiRP2/Kv3.4 fit to a function of the form: 1/{1 exp[(V1/2-V)/Vs]}, where V1/2 is the half-maximal voltage of activation and Vs the slope factor. The slope conductance for R83H-MiRP2/Kv3.4 currents was 19 2.2 mV (n 9 patches), intermediate between that of D90N-MiRP2/ Kv3.4 and wild-type MiRP2/Kv3.4 channels (Fig. 16 March 2002 R83H-MiRP2/Kv3.4 had open state time constants ( ) of 0.48 0.2 and 9.8 0.2 ms (weights of 0.78 0.2 and 0.22 0.03, respectively), values intermediate between those of D90N-MiRP2/Kv3.4 and wild-type MiRP2/ Kv3.4 channels (Fig. The effects of R83H-MiRP2 on KCNQ1 were similar to those of D90N-MiRP2 although less potent (Fig. HERG was studied here with K75H-MiRP1 and D82N-MiRP1, changes analogous to those associated with disease when carried in MiRP2 and MinK; then R83H-MiRP2 and D90N-MiRP2 were evaluated. 8), so D90N-MiRP2 suppressed HERG currents as efficiently as wild-type MiRP2: cells expressing D90N-MiRP2 and HERG showed mean tail currents of 330 62 nA at 30 mV, an 60% suppression current (Fig. Like arrhythmiaassociated D76N-MinK with KCNQ1 (12), D90N-MiRP2 shifted activation of Kv3.4 channels to more depolarized potentials, diminished steady-state open probability, lowered unitary conductance, and altered the voltage dependence KCNQ1 channels to diminish current density.

HERG was studied here with K75H-MiRP1 and D82N-MiRP1, changes analogous to those associated with disease when carried in MiRP2 and MinK; then R83H-MiRP2 and D90N-MiRP2 were evaluated. The K75H mutation decreased the down-regulatory effects of MiRP1 on HERG. K75H-MiRP1/HERG complexes showed a mean tail current density of 2.5 0.2 A at 30 mV similar to HERG channels (3.1 0.1 A) rather than wild-type MiRP1/HERG channels (0.76 0.1 A, n 16 20 cells) (Fig. Similarly, current deactivation with K75H-MiRP1 was like that of homomeric HERG channels ( 838 85 and 970 72 ms at 100 mV, respectively) rather than 395 wild-type MiRP1/HERG complexes ( 221 8 ms) (Fig. Conversely, K75H-MiRP1 and R83H-MiRP2 suppressed HERG less effectively than did wild-type.

Mutation of arginine to histidine (R 3 H) to yield R83H-MiRP2 is associated with periodic paralysis; the analogs K69H-MinK and K75H-MiRP1 were also studied. R83H-MiRP2 was identified by its sway over channels formed with Kv3.4 and association with periodic paralysis; an homologous arginine (R) or lysine (K) is found in all five MiRPs (2, 3, 8).

R83H-MiRP2 affects KCNQ1 and Kv3.4 similarly MiRP2 assembles with Kv3.4 to form a potassium channel active at subthreshold potentials that influences skeletal muscle cell RMP; the missense mutant R83HMiRP2 is associated with an inherited periodic paralysis; compared with wild-type MiRP2, the mutant reduces currents and causes skeletal muscle cell depolarization (8). 1) The R83H variant altered voltage dependence of ga3ing, producing a shift in the V1/2 for activation of t 1 0 mV to 9.2 2.1 mV (Fig. The slope conductance for R83H-MiRP2/Kv3.4 currents was 19 2.2 mV (n 9 patches), intermediate between that of D90N-MiRP2/ Kv3.4 and wild-type MiRP2/Kv3.4 channels (Fig. 2) At the single-channel level, R83H-MiRP2/Kv3.4 currents were of slightly smaller amplitude than wild-type and displayed fewer openings at negative potentials (Fig. Thus, R83H-MiRP2/Kv3.4 channels exhibited two open states (like wild-type), but the larger current measured just 1.8 0.2 pA at 60 mV (n 5) vs. 3) Steady-state open probability (Po) at 40 mV for channels with R83HMiRP2 was 0.006 0.002 (n 11 patches), 10-fold lower than for wild-type MiRP2/Kv3.4 channels but 12-fold more active than homomeric Kv3.4 channels (Fig. Although channels with R83H-MiRP2 showed two open state dwell times like wild-type (Fig. 16 March 2002 R83H-MiRP2/Kv3.4 had open state time constants ( ) of 0.48 0.2 and 9.8 0.2 ms (weights of 0.78 0.2 and 0.22 0.03, respectively), values intermediate between those of D90N-MiRP2/Kv3.4 and wild-type MiRP2/ Kv3.4 channels (Fig. We previously showed that the effects of the R83H mutation were not due to altered subunit assembly as R83H-MiRP2/Kv3.4 channels in excised CHO cell patches were blocked by BDS-II (like those with wild-type MiRP2) and 20-fold less effectively than homomeric Kv3.4 channels (8). The effects of R83H-MiRP2 on KCNQ1 were similar to those of D90N-MiRP2 although less potent (Fig. Like channels with wild-type MiRP2, R83H-MiRP2/ KCNQ1 exhibited a largely linear current-voltage relationship; however, the mutation restored some time and voltage dependence to channel activation and decreased macroscopic currents (Fig. Flux was decreased twofold from 7.3 0.4 A for channels with wild-type MiRP2 to 4.3 0.3 A for channels with R83H-MiRP2 (Fig. As a result, the RMP of R83H-MiRP2/KCNQ1-expressing cells was shifted by 15 7 mV in comparison to those with wild-type MiRP2/KCNQ1 channels (Fig. Confirmation that R83H-MiRP2 subunits remained competent to assemble with KCNQ1 was afforded by clotrimazole, which blocked homomeric KCNQ1 channels less effectively (Ki 419 22 M) than either those with wild-type or R83H-MiRP2 (Ki 217 20 and 177 18 M, respectively) (Fig. K69H-MinK also alters KCNQ1 function K69H-MinK subunits were studied with KCNQ1 to assess whether this site, analogous to R83H-MiRP2, was significant to function. R83H-MiRP2/Kv3.4 complexes show altered voltage dependence, lower unitary current, and diminished open probability.

Lower panel: representative dwell-time histogram at 40 mV from a single R83H-MiRP2/Kv3.4 channel held at steady state for 510 min; fit to a double exponential function (solid line) using Marquardt least-squares (PSTAT). HERG was studied here with K75H-MiRP1 and D82N-MiRP1, changes analogous to those associated with disease when carried in MiRP2 and MinK; then R83H-MiRP2 and D90N-MiRP2 were evaluated. R83H-MiRP2 suppressed HERG much less efficiently ( 20%): mean tail currents at 30 mV were 770 140 nA for R83H-MiRP2/HERG channels, 320 84 nA for channels with wild-type MiRP2, and 960 54 nA for homomeric HERG channels (Fig. Like periodic paralysis-associated R83H-MiRP2 with Kv3.4 (8), R83H-MiRP2 and K69H-MinK decreased current through KCNQ1 channels due to a shift in activation to more depolarized potentials. R83H-MiRP2/KCNQ1 complexes also show reduced current density and recovery of voltage and time dependence.

Conversely, K75H-MiRP1 and R83H-MiRP2 suppressed HERG less effectively than did wild-type. R83H, but not D90N, alters function of MiRP2/HERG complexes. Channels formed with HERG (triangle), wild-type-MiRP2/HERG (filled square), R83H-MiRP2/HERG (open square), or D90N-MiRP2/HERG (gray square) in oocytes studied by two-electrode voltage clamp. Finally, R83H-MiRP2 is associated with periodic paralysis and alters both the attributes of a prominent skeletal muscle cell potassium current and the resting membrane potential of muscle cells via endogenous MiRP2/Kv3.4 channels (8). Conversely, wild-type MinK has been shown to augment HERG currents by increasing the active fraction of channels in the membrane whereas D77N rat MinK (equivalent to D76N-human MinK) suppressed this up-regulatory effect despite its continued capacity to assemble with HERG (14, 24). Whereas stimulation of HERG was impeded by D77N mutation in rat minK ABBOTT AND GOLDSTEIN Figure 6. Each wild-type MiRP acted with these subunits to increase potassium current, and both D3 N changes (MinK-76, MiRP1 82, and MiRP290) and R/K3 H changes (MinK-69, MiRP175, and MiRP2 83) disrupted this capacity to increase flux. Whereas D3 N mutation disabled the ability of the MinK to increase potassium flux, it did not alter MiRP1 or MiRP2 suppression of HERG, suggesting either a more specific role for this residue or that the unique attributes of HERG yield this behavior. The effects of disease-associated mutations support a general correlation of function and domain: mutations in the extracellular region of MiRP1 alter voltagedependent activation and drug blockade (T8A and Q9E) (7, 13); mutations in the transmembrane and membrane-following segments influence gating kinetics and ion conduction (79, 12). MiRP1 mutations associated with a prolonged QT interval at baseline (Q9E, M54T, I57T, and A116V) act as one might expect to reduce currents passed through channels formed with HERG (by decreasing unitary conductance, shifting the voltage dependence of activation, and/or speeding of deactivation, thereby slowing cardiac repolarization) (7, 13). More specific effects are observed with one rare mutation (Q9E) and a common polymorphism (T8A) linked to antibiotic-induced arrhythmia, as these MiRP1 variants increase sensitivity of MiRP1/ HERG channels to blockade by the inciting drugs (7, 13).

Mutation of arginine to histidine (R 3 H) to yield R83H-MiRP2 is associated with periodic paralysis; the analogs K69H-MinK and K75H-MiRP1 were also studied.

K69H-MinK also alters KCNQ1 function K69H-MinK subunits were studied with KCNQ1 to assess whether this site, analogous to R83H-MiRP2, was significant to function. Like wild-type MinK, K69HABBOTT AND GOLDSTEIN The FASEB Journal Figure 5. Conversely, K69HMinK shifted the half-maximal activation to 50 0.1 mV (without a significant change in slope) from 30 0 .8 mV as measured for wild-type MinK/KCNQ1 channels (Fig. The mean current passed by K69HMinK/KCNQ1 channels was twofold lower than those with wild-type MinK at both 40 mV (2.7 0.2 vs. K69H-MinK/KCNQ1 channels showed faster deactivation kinetics with a mean time constant ( ) for deactivation of 277 16 ms ( 80 mV) vs. Like periodic paralysis-associated R83H-MiRP2 with Kv3.4 (8), R83H-MiRP2 and K69H-MinK decreased current through KCNQ1 channels due to a shift in activation to more depolarized potentials. K69H-MinK/KCNQ1 complexes show altered voltage dependence speeded deactivation and reduced potassium flux.

Thus, R/K3 H mutation disrupted the ability of all three KCNE peptides to alter subunit function whether the wild-type effect was to increase or suppress current. Inherited mutation of aspartate to asparagine (D 3 N) to yield D76N-MinK is linked to cardiac arrhythmia and deafness; the analogs D82N-MiRP1 and D90N-MiRP2 were studied. To explore this notion, we studied two residues essential to MinK and MiRP2 function and strongly conserved in the five known MiRPs: D76N-MinK was recognized by its association with inherited arrhythmia and deafness and alters function of channels formed with KCNQ1; an equivalent aspartate (D) is present in all but MiRP3 1 Present address: Cardiology Division, Departments of Medicine and Pharmacology, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY 10021, USA. Such cell-specific effects of KCNE peptides on current density and pharmacology are not without precedent; see refs 14, 24 for differential effects of D76N-minK on HERG and (7) for MiRPs: PROMISCUOUS DISRUPTION OF MULTIPLE CURRENTS RESULTS A conserved KCNE site influential in both MinK/KCNQ1 and MiRP2/Kv3.4 channels MinK assembles with KCNQ1 to slow channel activation, alter the voltage dependence of gating, and increase unitary conductance, thereby producing the attributes of native IKs channels (5, 6). Aspartate (D) to asparagine (N) mutation to yield D76N-MinK is associated with inherited long QT syndrome, sudden death, and deafness (9 11). Predicted topology (left) and partial sequences (right) of human MinK, MiRP1, and MiRP2 indicating extracellular (out) N and intracellular (in) C termini; alignment with numbering for MinK shows part of the predicted transmembrane (thick line) and membranefollowing region (thin line) with sites studied boxed in black: K69H (MinK); K75H (MiRP1); R83H (MiRP2) [open square]; D76N (MinK); D82N (MiRP1); D90N (MiRP2) [gray square]. At the single-channel level, the effects of D76N-MinK on KCNQ1 and D90N-MiRP2 on Kv3.4 were also similar (Fig. KCNQ1 is similarly affected by D76N-MinK and D90N-MiRP2 Whereas MinK is the `classical' partner for KCNQ1 (5, 6), expression of MiRP2 with KCNQ1 in experimental MiRPs: PROMISCUOUS DISRUPTION OF MULTIPLE CURRENTS cells produces a potassium-selective, voltage-insensitive (leak-type) current (Fig. Here we report that D90N-MiRP2 acts like D76NMinK to alter the voltage dependence and decrease macroscopic current passed by KCNQ1-containing channels. Conversely, wild-type MinK has been shown to augment HERG currents by increasing the active fraction of channels in the membrane whereas D77N rat MinK (equivalent to D76N-human MinK) suppressed this up-regulatory effect despite its continued capacity to assemble with HERG (14, 24). Like arrhythmiaassociated D76N-MinK with KCNQ1 (12), D90N-MiRP2 shifted activation of Kv3.4 channels to more depolarized potentials, diminished steady-state open probability, lowered unitary conductance, and altered the voltage dependence KCNQ1 channels to diminish current density.

I385L), HAP values and -dependence were slightly different, indicating that their implication in the -dependent shift of activation remains possible (14). A weak interaction seems to persist for the E338D mutant, suggesting that the affinity of binding is reduced. The binding of 35S-I-IIA E338D and 35S-I-IIA R387E is reduced or abolished, respectively. Mutagenic primers extended from Cav2.1 base pairs: 1428 1466 (I385L), 1434 1472 (R387E), 14371475 (E388D), 14431481 (N390K), 14521489 (M393L), 14551491 (E394D), 1464 1502 (S397T), and 14651507 (K398Q). In contrast to R387E, E388D, and N390K mutations, the average HIT value was increased by almost a 1 ctor of 2 for S397T (105 11 ms, n 6) and K398Q (127 fa 3 ms, n 14) mutants (Fig. Representative current traces are shown at a test potential of 20 mV for wild-type (wt) Cav2.1, Cav2.1 E388D, and Cav2.1 K398Q (left).

Two Individual Mutants (R387E and E388D) Affect the Sensitivity of the Channel to Subunit Modulation--It is likely that the contribution of several AID residues to inactivation can be affected by the interaction of AID with the 4 subunit. The HIT value was reduced by a factor of 2-fold for three channel mutants: Cav2.1 R387E (31 7 ms, n 6), Cav2.1 E388D (34 6 ms, n 9), and Cav2.1 N390K (44 4 ms, n 8). In contrast to R387E, E388D, and N390K mutations, the average HIT value was increased by almost a 1 ctor of 2 for S397T (105 11 ms, n 6) and K398Q (127 fa 3 ms, n 14) mutants (Fig. Curiously, however, some of the mutant channels that displayed the slowest inactivation kinetics in the presence of 4 subunit were also those that had among the fastest inactivation kinetics in the absence of 4 subunit (R387E and E388D). In contrast, Cav2.1 R387E and Cav2.1 E388D, with slowing factors of 21.3 4.3- and 11.0 1.4-fold, respectively, are clearly different. Remarkably, one should note that the Cav2.1 E388D mutant channel differs from wild-type Cav2.1 by only a methylene group in the side chain of the residue. Representative current traces are shown at a test potential of 20 mV for wild-type (wt) Cav2.1, Cav2.1 E388D, and Cav2.1 K398Q (left).

Coexpression of 4 results in a modification of the HIP value of Cav2.1 R387E only, which shifts toward depolarized values, and becomes 28.2 1 .2 mV (n 14), whereas the HIP value of Cav2.1 E388D remains unchanged with an average value of 40.8 2.0 mV (n 8). Thus, there is a significant change in -dependence for both R387E and E388D mutants, which confers to these mutated Cav2.1 a property that is shared by L-type channels only. It is also interesting to note that the HIP values of Cav2.1 R387E and Cav2.1 E388D in the absence of 4 are in close agreement with the HIP value of Cav2.1 in the presence of 4. By measuring peak currents, we found that half-activation potentials (HAP) were closely related in the absence of 4 subunit (HAP values of 2.7 1.2 mV (Cav2.1, n 9), 6.3 0.9 mV (Cav2.1 R387E, n 7), and 3.2 0.7 mV (Cav2.1 E388D, n 9)). Similarly, in the presence of 4, we observed average HAP values of 9.9 0.5 mV (Cav2.1, n 8), 9.7 0.7 mV (Cav2.1 R387E, n 8), and 8.5 0.7 mV (Cav2.1 E388D, n 9). Overexpression of the III-IV Loop Modifies Cav2.1 Inactivation in a Manner Similar to R387E and E388D Mutations--We investigated the relative importance of the various I-II loop interactions in inactivation by attempting to competitively in7 hibit them by the overexpression of cytoplasmic Cav2.1 se- FIG. Third, the HIP values observed for Cav2.1 R387E and Cav2.1 E388D in the absence of 4 and their -dependences were significantly different from that of wild-type Cav2.1.

To further functionally confirm that the AID mutants act by disrupting the normal I-II/III-IV interaction, we tested the effect of the III-IVA peptide on the kinetics and voltage dependence of inactivation of Cav2.1 E388D (Fig. HIT values observed at 20 mV for Cav2.1 E388D were 34.1 5.6 and 38.3 1.3 ms in the absence and presence of the peptide, respectively (Fig. In addition, HIP values were 40.1 2.4 mV (n 8, Cav2.1 E388D) and 38.7 1.7 mV (n 8, Cav2.1 E388D peptide III-IVA). The lack of effect of the peptide on the Cav2.1 E388D strongly suggests that both the mutation and the peptide act by a similar mechanism to alter inactivation of the channel. In favor of such an interpretation is the finding that 4 subunit produces a shift in the HIP value of Cav2.1 similar to that observed with R387E, E388D or the III-IVA peptide. Our results are thus consistent with the interpretation that R387E or E388D, excess of the III-IV loop, or the 4 subunit all act on inactivation by a common step, which is the disruption of the interaction between the I-II loop and the III-IV loop.

C, average steady-state inactivation curves for Cav2.1 E388D alone (n 8) or coinjected with the III-IVA peptide (n 8). The striking similarities observed between the inactivation properties of Cav2.1 R387E, Cav2.1 E388D, and Cav2.1 coexpressed with the III-IVA sequence suggest that both R387E and E388D may regulate inactivation by selectively disrupting the interaction between the I-II and III-IV loops.

The most striking effect was observed with the R387E mutation with an average HIT value of 660 53 ms (n 12). 2) suggest that, in this region, the effects of the individual residues are not additive as the HIT value of the R387E mutation approached that of the Cav2.1 AIDC/D chimera.

In contrast to R387E, E388D, and N390K mutations, the average HIT value was increased by almost a 1 ctor of 2 for S397T (105 11 ms, n 6) and K398Q (127 fa 3 ms, n 14) mutants (Fig. The shifts observed were mostly toward hyperpolarized values and ranged between 12.9 mV (M393L) and 20.5 mV (N390K), with an average value of 16.2 mV for wild-type Cav2.1.

12819016	To reveal the possible involvement of the protein quality control system in processing AQP2 mutants , we created an in vitro system of clone 9 hepatocytes stably expressing endoplasmic reticulum-retained T126M AQP2 and misrouted E258K AQP2 as well as wild-type AQP2 and studied their biosynthesis , degradation , and intracellular distribution. Remarkable differences in the degradation kinetics were observed for the glycosylated and nonglycosylated T126M AQP2 (t1/2 2.0 hours versus 0.9 hours). Notwithstanding the differences in degradation kinetics and subcellular distribution such as endoplasmic reticulum-retention and misrouting to lysosomes , both T126M and E258K AQP2 were efficiently degraded. In many of the autosomal recessive NDI-causing AQP2 mutations, retention of the mutant protein in the ER was reported20,23,25 whereas the autosomal dominant NDI-causing E258K AQP2 was localized in the Golgi apparatus.24 Expression of the ER-retained T126M AQP2 in clone 9 Supported by the Bonizzi-Theler Foundation, Zurich, and the Canton of Zurich. In a single study using the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and the lysosomotropic agent NH4Cl, no influence of these two reagents was observed on the degradation kinetics of ER-retained AQP2 mutants when transiently expressed in CHO cells.22 In the present study we have established an in vitro system by transfection of clone 9 rat hepatocytes to stably express wt AQP2 as well as the ERretained T126M AQP2 and the Golgi apparatus localized E258K AQP2 to investigate their intracellular distribution, turnover, and mode of degradation. We found that this detergent concentration extracted all wt AQP2 as well as T126M AQP2 and E258K AQP2 (data not shown). To inhibit N-glycosylation, clone 9 cells expressing T126M AQP2 were incubated in cysteine and methioninefree Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing tunicamycin (1 g/ml) for 30 minutes at 37C and then pulsed for 40 minutes with 100 Ci/ml of 35S-cysteine and 35 S-methionine in the presence of tunicamycin (1 g/ml). Immunoprecipitated proteins were released by boiling for 10 minutes at 100C in Laemmli buffer and separated in a Results Stable Expression of Wild-Type and Mutant AQP2 in Clone 9 Rat Hepatocytes We have analyzed two mutant AQP2 as compared to wt AQP2, namely the T126M point mutation located in the second extracellular loop and the E258K point mutation present in the carboxy terminus of AQP2 (Figure 1). The presence of wt as well as T126M AQP2 and E258K AQP2 in clonal cell lines derived from transfected clone 9 rat hepatocytes was verified by RT-PCR, Western blot analysis, and immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled proteins. A: The 32-kd form of metabolically labeled and immunoprecipitated wild-type, T126M, and E258K AQP2 is endo H-sensitive and becomes converted to a 29-kd form. B: Likewise the 32-kd form of wild-type, T126M, and E258K AQP2 is N-glycosidase F-sensitive. C: Tunicamycin treatment results in absence of the 32-kd form of T126M AQP2. Western blot analysis revealed one immunoreactive band with an apparent molecular mass of 29 kd in cells expressing either wt AQP2 or E258K AQP2 and an additional immunoreactive band migrating at 32 kd in T126M AQP2-expressing cells (data not shown). When AQP2 synthesis was analyzed by metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation, two bands with an apparent molecular mass of 29 kd and of 32 kd were observed in the wt AQP2-, T126M AQP2-, and E258K AQP2-expressing cells (Figure 3A). This difference was not observed with T126M AQP2. In addition, T126M AQP2 synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin to block its N-linked glycosylation gave only a single 29-kd band (Figure 3C). Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy for the detection of AQP2 in clone 9 cells expressing the T126M AQP2 revealed an ER-like pattern (Figure 6) and no evidence for co-distribution with Golgi mannosidase II (data not shown). The T126M AQP2 stably expressed in clone 9 hepatocytes exhibits an ER-like immunofluorescence. Effect of proteasome inhibitors and lysosomotropic agents on turnover of T126M and E258K-AQP2 in clone 9 hepatocytes. A: Autoradiogram of metabolically labeled and immunoprecipitated T126M AQP2 chased in the presence of the indicated proteasome inhibitors or chloroquine. Filled columns represent the glycosylated 32-kd form and open columns the nonglycosylated 29-kd form of T126M AQP2. As illustrated in Figure 8, the T126M AQP2 and E258K AQP2 were more rapidly degraded than the wt AQP2. When the degradation of the glycosylated 32-kd and the nonglycosylated 29-kd forms of T126M AQP2 were determined, their average t1/2 were 2.0 0.5 hours and 0.9 0.3 hours, respectively (Figure 8B). The effect of the proteasome inhibitors lactacystin, MG132, and ALLN on the turnover of T126M AQP2 was studied in cells pulsed for 45 minutes in the absence of the inhibitors and chased for 2 hours in the presence of the respective proteasome inhibitor. As shown in Figure 9, A and B, all three inhibitors had a pronounced inhibitory effect on both the 32-kd and 29-kd form of the ER-retained T126M AQP2, whereas the lysosomotropic agent chloroquine had none. The densitometric evaluation demonstrated a stronger effect of the different proteasome inhibitors on the glycosylated 32-kd T126M AQP2 compared to the nonglycosylated form (Figure 9B). 1 Discussion In the present study we have investigated aspects of the biosynthesis and degradation of the ER-retained T126M AQP2 and the E258K AQP2 reported to be retained in the Golgi apparatus. Our results indicate that the T126M AQP2 is synthesized as a glycosylated 32-kd as well as a nonglycosylated 29-kd form, both of which are rapidly degraded by the proteasome, albeit at different kinetics. Previous studies have shown that the T126M AQP2 represents a functional water channel that is retained in the ER.30 In our stable expression system, T126M AQP2 was synthesized as a high mannose-type 32-kd and a nonglycosylated 29-kd form, alike observed in kidney extracts of T126M AQP2 knock-in mice.31 The two T126M AQP2 forms exhibited significant differences in their turnover rates. In the case of the T126M AQP2, strategies to preferentially target the glycosylated form should be envisaged. The higher stability of the glycosylated 32-kd T126M AQP2 form is apparently due to the recognition of its oligosaccharide by the protein quality control system.1 Although further studies will be required to elucidate the details of this interaction, we assume bona fide that the mechanism we established for misfolded carboxypeptidase Y in yeast39,40 and which has been shown to be functioning for misfolded (1)-antitrypsin, ribophorin I and Ig subunits expressed in mammalian cells32,41,42 is also operative for the glycosylated 32-kd T126M AQP2 form. In the case of misfolded carboxypeptidase Y, the presence of mono-glucosylated oligosaccharides provided a positive signal for protein folding39 and that of the Man8GlcNAc2-B isomer generated by ER mannosidase I a signal for ERAD.40 Naturally, this mechanism cannot be functioning in the disposal of the nonglycosylated 29-kd T126M AQP2 form and to the best of our knowledge, no data regarding the recognition mechanism acting on nonglycosylated ER-retained mutated proteins are available. The other novel observation is that the proteasome is involved in the degradation of T126M AQP2 whereas no evidence for the involvement of lysosomes in the degradation process was obtained. Although the three different proteasome inhibitors exhibited a similar stabilization effect on the glycosylated T126M AQP2 form, the effect on the nonglycosylated form was less pronounced. Thus, for the nonglycosylated form of T126M AQP2 mutant, we cannot rule out that other proteolytic activities in addition to the proteasome may be involved. The differential stabilization effect of the proteasome inhibitors on the glycosylated versus the nonglycosylated T126M AQP2 form implies that in our system no significant deglycosylation of the retained 32-kd T126M AQP2 occurs under these conditions and that deglycosylation is apparently coupled to its proteasomal degradation. In contrast to the recessive NDI-causing ER-retained T126M AQP2, the E258K AQP2 has been reported to be retained in the Golgi apparatus of Xenopus oocytes24 and transiently transfected CHO cells22 and to form mixed oligomers with wt AQP2, thereby causing dominant NDI.29 In the present study we confirm the Golgi localization of E258K AQP2 by using double confocal immunofluorescence to detect the Golgi marker mannosidase II. The E258K AQP2 had an average half-life similar to that of the T126M AQP2. However, the T126M AQP2 and the E258K AQP2 expressed in clone 9 hepatocytes seem to be recognized by different quality control mechanisms and become efficiently degraded despite the fact that one is retained in the ER and the other is being misrouted to late endosomes and lysosomes. To reveal the possible involvement of the protein quality control system in processing AQP2 mutants , we created an in vitro system of clone 9 hepatocytes stably expressing endoplasmic reticulum-retained T126M AQP2 and misrouted E258K AQP2 as well as wild-type AQP2 and studied their biosynthesis , degradation , and intracellular distribution. Degradation of E258K AQP2 also occurred rapidly (t1/2 1.8 hours) but in a proteasome- and lysosome-dependent manner. By triple confocal immunofluorescence microscopy misrouting of E258K to lysosomes via the Golgi apparatus could be demonstrated. Notwithstanding the differences in degradation kinetics and subcellular distribution such as endoplasmic reticulum-retention and misrouting to lysosomes , both T126M and E258K AQP2 were efficiently degraded. Autosomal recessive NDI-causing mutants expressed in Xenopus oocytes were detected as a nonglycosylated 29-kd and an endo H-sensitive, high-mannose 32-kd form.20 But only a 29-kd form was observed in transiently transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)22 or LLC-PK1 cells.23 The autosomal dominant NDI-causing E258K AQP2 existed as a 29-kd form both in Xenopus oocytes24 and in transiently transfected CHO cells.22 Heterologous expression has provided evidence for an impaired routing of mutant AQP2 proteins. In many of the autosomal recessive NDI-causing AQP2 mutations, retention of the mutant protein in the ER was reported20,23,25 whereas the autosomal dominant NDI-causing E258K AQP2 was localized in the Golgi apparatus.24 Expression of the ER-retained T126M AQP2 in clone 9 Supported by the Bonizzi-Theler Foundation, Zurich, and the Canton of Zurich. In a single study using the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and the lysosomotropic agent NH4Cl, no influence of these two reagents was observed on the degradation kinetics of ER-retained AQP2 mutants when transiently expressed in CHO cells.22 In the present study we have established an in vitro system by transfection of clone 9 rat hepatocytes to stably express wt AQP2 as well as the ERretained T126M AQP2 and the Golgi apparatus localized E258K AQP2 to investigate their intracellular distribution, turnover, and mode of degradation. We found that this detergent concentration extracted all wt AQP2 as well as T126M AQP2 and E258K AQP2 (data not shown). Clonal cells stably expressing wt AQP2 or E258K AQP2 were treated with forskolin (10 mol/L) for 30 minutes at 37C and processed for AQP2 immunofluorescence. Immunoprecipitated proteins were released by boiling for 10 minutes at 100C in Laemmli buffer and separated in a Results Stable Expression of Wild-Type and Mutant AQP2 in Clone 9 Rat Hepatocytes We have analyzed two mutant AQP2 as compared to wt AQP2, namely the T126M point mutation located in the second extracellular loop and the E258K point mutation present in the carboxy terminus of AQP2 (Figure 1). The presence of wt as well as T126M AQP2 and E258K AQP2 in clonal cell lines derived from transfected clone 9 rat hepatocytes was verified by RT-PCR, Western blot analysis, and immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled proteins. The reason was that mixed tetramer formation between wt and E258K AQP2 has been reported that resulted in the retention of the wt protein and causing dominant NDI.24,29 As shown in Figure 2B, AQP9 RNA was undetectable in clone 9 114 Hirano et al AJP July 2003, Vol. A: The 32-kd form of metabolically labeled and immunoprecipitated wild-type, T126M, and E258K AQP2 is endo H-sensitive and becomes converted to a 29-kd form. B: Likewise the 32-kd form of wild-type, T126M, and E258K AQP2 is N-glycosidase F-sensitive. Thus, the possible formation of mixed tetramers composed of wt AQP9 and E258K AQP2 can be excluded. Western blot analysis revealed one immunoreactive band with an apparent molecular mass of 29 kd in cells expressing either wt AQP2 or E258K AQP2 and an additional immunoreactive band migrating at 32 kd in T126M AQP2-expressing cells (data not shown). When AQP2 synthesis was analyzed by metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation, two bands with an apparent molecular mass of 29 kd and of 32 kd were observed in the wt AQP2-, T126M AQP2-, and E258K AQP2-expressing cells (Figure 3A). In wt and E258K AQP2-expressing cells, the 32-kd form in contrast to the 29-kd form became detectable as a faint band only after a 30-minute pulse and its intensity increased in cells pulsed for 60 minutes. However, the increase in intensity of the 29-kd band of wt and E258K AQP2 after N-glycosidase F treatment was stronger as compared to that observed after endo H treatment. This demonstrates that the wt and E258K AQP2 oligosaccharide has been processed in the Golgi apparatus. In contrast, the E258K AQP2 immunofluorescence co-distributed with Golgi mannosidase II (Figure 7; Figure 2. By using the triple-staining protocol to visualize AQP2 (Figure 7D), endocytosed transferrin (Figure 7E) and lysosomes (Figure 7G), this AQP2 staining was shown to be due to the codistribution of E258K AQP2 with late endosomes and lysosomes (Figure 7, H and I). Co-distribution of E258K Figure 5. Mutant E258K AQP2 stably expressed in clone 9 hepatocytes exhibits a dual Golgi apparatus and late endosome/lysosome distribution.

Triple labeling for the simultaneous detection of E258K AQP2 ( D ), endocytosed transferrin ( E ), and LAMP1 ( G ). A single confocal section reveals the above-described dual distribution of E258K AQP2 ( D ) and an extensive dot-like distribution of transferrin ( E ). The merged triple-labeling image shown in H reveals co-distribution of E258K AQP2 with transferrin and LAMP1 as indicated by the white color. The arrowheads in D, G, and H point to some of the elements that are positive for E258K AQP2, transferrin, and LAMP1 that are reflected by the white color. The purple color visible in I indicates co-distribution of E258K AQP2 and LAMP1 in lysosomes. When cells expressing E258K AQP2 were incubated with forskolin, no change in the pattern of AQP2 immunofluorescence could be observed (data not shown). Effect of proteasome inhibitors and lysosomotropic agents on turnover of T126M and E258K-AQP2 in clone 9 hepatocytes. C: Autoradiogram of metabolically labeled and immunoprecipitated E258K AQP2 chased in the presence of lactacystin, MG132, chloroquine, or ammonium chloride. As illustrated in Figure 8, the T126M AQP2 and E258K AQP2 were more rapidly degraded than the wt AQP2. Although the glycosylated 32-kd form was detectable at the end of the pulse in both the wt AQP2 and E258K AQP2, it became undetectable after a 1-hour chase, in contrast to the nonglycosylated 29-kd form (Figure 8A). The average t1/2 of degradation of E258K AQP2 was determined to be 1.8 0.1 hours (Figure 8B). We applied the same protocol to study the effect of proteasome inhibitors and lysosomotropic agents on the turnover of E258K AQP2. As illustrated in Figure 9, C and D, both the used proteasome inhibitors and the lysosomotropic agents retarded the degradation of E258K AQP2 to a similar degree. 1 Discussion In the present study we have investigated aspects of the biosynthesis and degradation of the ER-retained T126M AQP2 and the E258K AQP2 reported to be retained in the Golgi apparatus. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the E258K AQP2 is not exclusively retained in the Golgi apparatus but becomes misrouted to late endosomes/lysosomes and that its degradation involves both proteasomes and lysosomes. In contrast to the recessive NDI-causing ER-retained T126M AQP2, the E258K AQP2 has been reported to be retained in the Golgi apparatus of Xenopus oocytes24 and transiently transfected CHO cells22 and to form mixed oligomers with wt AQP2, thereby causing dominant NDI.29 In the present study we confirm the Golgi localization of E258K AQP2 by using double confocal immunofluorescence to detect the Golgi marker mannosidase II. However, by using additional double confocal immunofluorescence microscopy to detect the late endosome/ lysosome marker LAMP 1, co-distribution of E258K AQP2 with LAMP 1 could be unequivocally demonstrated in the clone 9 hepatocytes. A triple fluorescence labeling experiment additionally visualizing endocytosed transferrin fully supported the post-Golgi localization of E258K AQP2. If the misrouting of E258K AQP2 via the Golgi apparatus to lysosomes is related to specific features of clone 9 hepatocytes as compared to Xenopus oocytes or CHO cells is unknown. When we investigated the degradation kinetics of the E258K AQP2, metabolically labeled protein initially existed as a 29-kd and a 32-kd form with the latter rapidly disappearing, as has been observed for the wt AQP2. The E258K AQP2 had an average half-life similar to that of the T126M AQP2. Taking into account the intracellular steady state distribution of E258K AQP2 in late endosomes and lysosomes in addition to the Golgi apparatus, it was not unexpected that we found it to be stabilized by the lysosomotropic agents chloroquine and Degradation of Mutant Aquaporin-2 119 AJP July 2003, Vol. Very recently, the involvement of both proteasome and lysosomes in the degradation pathway of wt AQP2 in a mouse renal collecting duct cell line was reported.44 Thus, as observed for other membrane proteins,45,46 the final degradative pathway for wt AQP2 and misrouted E258K AQP2 seems to involve both the proteasome and lysosomes. However, the T126M AQP2 and the E258K AQP2 expressed in clone 9 hepatocytes seem to be recognized by different quality control mechanisms and become efficiently degraded despite the fact that one is retained in the ER and the other is being misrouted to late endosomes and lysosomes. 
12738236	[19] who found that a single mutation (G1406R) can lead either to Brugada syndrome more frequently in males or cardiac conduction defect. Both the mutant described in the present study and the G1406R mutant lead to complete loss of function. An important difference, however, is that G1406R-mutated Na+ channels are correctly processed to the membrane, whereas the 5280delGmutated channels in our study are not. In vivo, the difference between 5280delG and G1406R Na+ channel trafficking may result in different WT Na+ channel expression levels in the sarcolemma by a yet unknown mechanism, thus differentiating in the severity of the disease.

The patient was affected with congenital deafness, which urged us to analyze his gene for barttin, and a mutation G47R, which was previously reported, has been identified. This might be due to a less severe loss of function of barttin induced by G47R mutation, compared with others, and our observation seems to suggest a possibility of the prevalence of mild form BSND with various levels of barttin dysfunction among patients with congenital deafness of unknown origin.

Recently we have analyzed our patient's BSND gene and identified a homozygous point mutation of G47R (a nucleotide change of G139A). Because we have not analyzed the function of the product with G47R mutation, it seems questionable to assert that the mutation is responsible for the patient's syndrome. However, the function of G47R has recently been reported (14). In their functional analysis, G47R mutation of barttin (clinical data were not shown) has been proved to abolish the stimulatory effect on ClC-Ka when cotransfected into Xenopus oocytes (14). This confirms that the G47R mutation of the gene for barttin in our patient is responsible for BSND. The extraordinary clinical characteristics for BSND of our G47R patient such as absence of polyhydramnios, normal physical and mental developments, and full-term delivery may be due to milder functional abnormality of the ClC-Kbbarttin complex with G47R mutation, compared with other BSND patients (Table 1). A similarity of the phenotype between our patient with BSND and those with classic form may result from a similar dysfunction of the ClC-Kb-barttin complex, the former with G47R mutation of barttin and the latter with various mutations of ClC-Kb itself (17). Functional analysis of the ClC-Kb-barttin complex with G47R mutation has not been successful in vitro (14).

We have described the first distinct BSND patient of Asian origin and the clinical manifestation of a patient with G47R mutation for the first time in the world. It is of interest that G47R mutation was detected in a Japanese patient because all the BSND patients reported so far have been from the Middle and Near East, Europe, or North Africa; the origin of the previous G47R patient has not been described in the literature (14). It might be possible that G47R is a hot spot for the barttin mutation across the race. Prevalence of the G47R mutation should be determined, and PCR-RFLP analysis using a restriction enzyme Bcl I may benefit the screening for the carrier of this mutation. The milder clinical picture of our G47R patient concerning renal tubular salt loss than those of severe form of BSND suggests a possibility of the presence of mild form BSND with less severe loss of function of barttin among patients with congenital deafness of unknown origin.

Recent studies on recombinant 4 2 AC hRs containing the 4 subunit S247F mutation showed that these AC hRs ex hibit significantly faster desensiti z ation and slower recover y from the desensiti z ed state as compared w ith w ild t y pe (Weiland et al., 1996). To understand the pathological mechani sms resulting from the 4 S247F mutation, we compared in detail the ex pression, kinetics, pharmacolog y, and channel properties of mutant and w ildt y pe 4 2 AC hRs. cDNA s encodi ng the human 4 and S247F 4 subunits were cloned i nto a modified pSP64 pol y(A ) (Promega, Madi son, W I) ex pression vector w ith a unique EcoRI site and digested; stick y ends were fil led i n w ith K lenow enz y me (Boehr i nger Mannhei m, Indianapoli s, I N) and religated w ith T4 DNA pol y merase (New Eng land Biolabs, Beverl y, M A).

Furthermore, increase of ex tracellular Mg 2 potentially could cause channel block that could be altered by the S247F mutation.

S247F mutation of the 4 subunit eliminates C a 2 permeabilit y of the 4 2 AC hRs, which was restored by coex pression of 5 subunits. DISCUSSION In the present study we show that the S247F mutation in 4 subunits causes significant acceleration of desensiti z ation and slows recover y from desensiti z ation. T he S247F mutation in human 4 subunits did not cause notable changes, at least in ooc y tes, in the ex pression efficienc y of either 4 2 or 4 2 5 AC hRs. Similar results were reported for rat S247F mutant 4 2 AC hRs ex pressed in ooc y tes (Figl et al., 1997). Potentiation of the responses to agoni st on successi ve ex posures in the case of the S247F mutant i s an interesting phenomenon that may have implications for the pathological mechani sms of A DN FL E. T he S247F mutation had little effect on the EC50 of the AC h binding site ligands AC h or nicotine but did reduce the efficac y of the channel-blocking ligand amantadine. T he S247F mutation i s located in the part of M2 thought to form the intermediate hydrophilic ring in the channel that contributes to cation selecti v it y (I moto et al., 1988). T he S247F mutation in the 4 subunit had a considerable impact on the single channel properties of the resulting AC hRs. Top, Records are from outsideout patches taken from ooc y tes that were injected w ith either human 4 2 or human S247F mutant 4 2 AC hRs. T he net f unctional capacit y of the S247F 4 mutants thus i s reduced by four mechani sms that reduce the net flow of ions through acti vated AC hRs: (1) C a 2 permeabilit y i s lost, (2) desensiti z ation i s increased, (3) channel opening time i s reduced, and (4) channel conductance i s reduced.

We mutated this valine to glutamate in rClC-K1 (V166E) and thus converted this region to the GKEGP consensus sequence found in all other members of the CLC family. Additionally, measurements of tail currents in the presence of different anions revealed that the V166E mutation changed the anion conductB N C I ance sequence from Br O3 l (wild type) to Cl N I r O3 (Fig. Niflumic acid (10 M) and anthracene-9-carboxylic acid (500 M) had no effect, whereas 4,4 -diisothiocyanostilbene2,2 -disulfonic acid (500 M) completely blocked currents induced by both wild type ClC-K1 and ClC-K1(V166E) (data not shown). Similar to rClC-K1, the V166E mutation conferred voltage dependence on ClC-Kb(c)-induced currents (Fig. In contrast to the rClC-K1(V166E) mutation, however, Functional Characterization of ClC-K Channels 24531 FIG. E, currents measured after expression of ClC-Kb(c)(V166E). F, I-V relationships of ClC-Kb(c)(V166E)-induced currents under anionic conditions as described for C. An increase in extracellular calcium concentration did not change the magnitude of ClC-Kb(c) and ClC-Kb(c)(V166E)-mediated currents (data not shown). We could show that a single point mutation in this region (V166E) changes both the anion conductance sequence and gating of rClC-K1-mediated currents. The V166E mutation restores the GKEGP consensus sequence found in all other known CLC proteins and introduces a strong voltage-dependent gating. We therefore introduced the point mutations that were found in patients (11) into the ClC-Kb(c) construct (P124L, A204T, A349D, Y432H, and R438C) and expressed these in oocytes.

To date, several point mutations have been described in the human RYR1 gene: Cys35Arg,5 Arg163Cys,6 Gly248Arg,7 8 9 Gly341Arg, Tyr522Ser, Arg552Trp,10 Arg614Cys,11 Arg614Leu,12 Gly2435Arg,13 14 Arg2436His,15 Arg2163Cys, Arg2163His, Val2168Met, Thr2206Met,16 Arg2458Cys, and Arg2458His.17 Among these point mutations, Arg163Cys, Tyr522Ser, and Arg2436His have been identified in MHS families who also have central core disease (CCD), a rare myopathy characterised by hypotonia and proximal muscle weakness, closely associated with MH.18 One additional mutation, Ile403Met, was found only in association with CCD.6 The known mutations are localised at the 5' end (exons 2, 6, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17) and in the middle (exons 39, 45, 46) of the gene.

The mutation Arg163Cys in exon 6 was analysed by specific restriction enzyme digestion.6 These mutations account for about 20-25% of MHS cases. As already repor ted,6 the Arg163Cys mutation causes loss of a BstUI site and was therefore analysed by restriction enzyme digestion. We found a mutation Arg163Cys in exon 6 in one MHSCCD patient; a mutation in exon 11 (Gly341Arg) in one MHS patient and his aVected mother; in exon 17 we found one MHS patient carr ying the Arg614Cys mutation, who showed a minicore feature, and two patients carr ying the Arg614Leu mutation; in exon 45 we found a mutation (Gly2435Arg) in one patient and her mother, a silent mutation in another patient (C7260T), and one G7304T transversion which results in a novel amino acid substitution at position 2436 (Arg2436Leu) in one MHS-CCD patient. Using this approach we found nine point mutations in 57 Italian patients analysed for the presence of mutations in five RYR1 exons and for the presence of the Arg163Cys substitution, which corresponds to a frequency of about 15.8% of these RYR1 point mutations in Italian MHS patients. High IVCT contracture values were found in patients F79/61 and F93/86 carr ying the Arg163Cys and the Arg2436Leu mutations respectively. In agreement with previous obser vations,6 the Arg163Cys mutation was found in a MHS patient who also showed a feature of CCD. To date, several point mutations have been described in the human RYR1 gene: Cys35Arg,5 Arg163Cys,6 Gly248Arg,7 8 9 Gly341Arg, Tyr522Ser, Arg552Trp,10 Arg614Cys,11 Arg614Leu,12 Gly2435Arg,13 14 Arg2436His,15 Arg2163Cys, Arg2163His, Val2168Met, Thr2206Met,16 Arg2458Cys, and Arg2458His.17 Among these point mutations, Arg163Cys, Tyr522Ser, and Arg2436His have been identified in MHS families who also have central core disease (CCD), a rare myopathy characterised by hypotonia and proximal muscle weakness, closely associated with MH.18 One additional mutation, Ile403Met, was found only in association with CCD.6 The known mutations are localised at the 5' end (exons 2, 6, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17) and in the middle (exons 39, 45, 46) of the gene.

We set up PCR and SSCP conditions for the detection of the more frequent nine point mutations (Gly341Arg, Arg614Cys, Arg614Leu, Arg2163Cys, Arg2163His, Gly2435Arg, Arg2436His, Arg2458Cys, and Arg2458His). The remaining four (Arg2163Cys, Arg2163His, Arg2436His, and Arg2458His) were not obser ved in our patients. Recently, the Arg2163Cys substitution in exon 39 was repor ted with a frequency of 4%,16 together with Arg2163His in a single family. In order to increase the sensitivity of the SSCP technique, the exon 39 PCR product was digested into two smaller fragments, but still no conformational variants were obser ved, confirming that the Arg2163Cys and the Arg2163His mutations do not occur in our patients. We found a mutation Arg163Cys in exon 6 in one MHSCCD patient; a mutation in exon 11 (Gly341Arg) in one MHS patient and his aVected mother; in exon 17 we found one MHS patient carr ying the Arg614Cys mutation, who showed a minicore feature, and two patients carr ying the Arg614Leu mutation; in exon 45 we found a mutation (Gly2435Arg) in one patient and her mother, a silent mutation in another patient (C7260T), and one G7304T transversion which results in a novel amino acid substitution at position 2436 (Arg2436Leu) in one MHS-CCD patient.

The two new mutations presented here satisfy the criteria for potential causative MHS mutations: neither Arg2454His nor Arg2436Leu were found in 96 normal chromosomes analysed and these amino acids are conser ved across species and related isoforms indicating their functional significance. Furthermore, the Arg2454His mutation segregates with the MHS phenotype in the pedigree investigated here (fig 1, V.3, V.5, and VI.2), 118 Barone, Massa, Intravaia, et al allowing us to perfor m a presymptomatic diagnosis of MHS for the people (IV.1, VI.3, VI.4, VI.5, VI.6, and VI.7) not yet investigated by IVCT.

Accordingly, we detected five of the known mutations (Gly341Arg, Arg614Cys, Arg614Leu, Gly2435Arg, and Arg2458Cys). We found a mutation Arg163Cys in exon 6 in one MHSCCD patient; a mutation in exon 11 (Gly341Arg) in one MHS patient and his aVected mother; in exon 17 we found one MHS patient carr ying the Arg614Cys mutation, who showed a minicore feature, and two patients carr ying the Arg614Leu mutation; in exon 45 we found a mutation (Gly2435Arg) in one patient and her mother, a silent mutation in another patient (C7260T), and one G7304T transversion which results in a novel amino acid substitution at position 2436 (Arg2436Leu) in one MHS-CCD patient.

High IVCT contracture values were found in patients F79/61 and F93/86 carr ying the Arg163Cys and the Arg2436Leu mutations respectively.

A similar syndrome is also present in pigs, where it has been shown that the primar y defect resides in a single point mutation (Arg614Cys) in the porcine RYR1 protein.2 The human RYR1 gene is localised on chromosome 19 at q12-13.2 and is composed of 106 exons spanning a genomic region of 160 kb.3 4 Linkage analysis and mutation screening showed that mutations in the RYR1 gene are responsible for about 30-40% of human MHS patients.

Another variant in exon 46 was found to give rise to a new mutation (G7361A) which causes the substitution of arginine at position 2454 with a histidine. Analysis of the DNA sequence surrounding the nucleotide change G7361A indicated that this mutation destroyed a BstUI restriction site allowing us to assess the cosegregation of the mutated allele with the MH phenotype in a large pedigree (fig 1).

14660621	For mutation in the RGD motif (the recognition sequence of integrin for other proteins), GIRK4(R115K) did not affect the mechanosensitivity of GIRK4 channel (Fig. C, mutation in the RGD motif of the GIRK4 channel (GIRK4(R115K)) had no significant effect on the mechanosensitivity (mean S.E., n 4, no significant difference from wild-type GIRK4). IRK1 gained mechanosensitivity and PKC sensitivity by reverse double point mutation of the PIP2 binding domain (L222I/R213Q). We, therefore, further constructed a reverse double point mutant, IRK1(L222I/R213Q), to obtain a greater modification of the channel-PIP2 interaction. Interestingly, the reverse double point mutant, IRK1(L222I/R213Q), was inhibited by PKC activation as rapidly as wild-type GIRK4. D, a reverse double point mutant of IRK1 (IRK1(L222I/R213Q)), which is expected to have weaker PIP2 affinity, gained mechanosensitivity, although the time course of current inhibition was slower than that of wild-type GIRK4. B, time course of changes in the whole cell current in response to 1 M PMA in oocytes expressing GIRK4(WT), IRK1(WT), reverse single point mutants of IRK1 (IRK1(L222I), and IRK1(R213Q)), and a double point mutant of IRK1 (IRK1(L222I/R213Q) (mean S.E., n 4 8). The five single point mutants in which serine or threonine was replaced with alanine, or the mutant in which all five phosphorylation sites were abolished, still retained PKC sensitivity in terms of the PMA-induced current reduction comparable with wild-type GIRK4, although GIRK4(S233A) and the quintuple mutant yielded small basal currents (Fig. The mutations did not affect PKC sensitivity and mechanosensitivity, although the basal current amplitude was decreased in GIRK4(S233A) and GIRK4(quintuple). GIRK4 chimera (GIRK4-IRK1(Lys207-Leu245)) and single point mutant (GIRK4(I229L)), in which the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) binding domain or residue was replaced by the corresponding region of IRK1 to strengthen the channel-PIP2 interaction, showed no mechanosensitivity and minimal PKC sensitivity. The resultant chimera and mutant were designated as GIRK4-IRK1(Lys207-Leu245) and GIRK4(I229L) (Fig. Both of GIRK4-IRK1(Lys207-Leu245) and GIRK4(I229L) subunits) in oocytes channels expressed alone (without G had larger basal current with strong inward rectification compared with GIRK4 channels co-expressed with G . The mechanosensitivity was abolished almost completely in the GIRK4-IRK1(Lys207-Leu245) and GIRK4(I229L) channels (Fig. 6A, the GIRK4(I229L) and the GIRK4-IRK1(Lys207-Leu245), which are predicted to have stronger PIP2 affinity than wild-type GIRK4, had significantly less PKC sensitivity; the current reduction at 30 min for GIRK4(I229L) (by 29 2.0%, n 4) and the corresponding value for GIRK4-IRK1(Lys207-Leu245) (by 18 1.8% n 6) 8 were both significantly less than wild-type GIRK4 (by 42.6 .4%, n 8) (p 0.05). A GIRK4 mutant (GIRK4(I229L)) and a chimera (GIRK4-IRK1(Lys207-Leu245)), which strengthens the channel-PIP2 interaction, unlike wild-type GIRK4, did not show mechanosensitivity. A, time course of changes in the whole cell current at 140 mV in response to 1 M PMA (a PKC activator) in oocytes expressing wild-type GIRK4, a GIRK4 mutant (GIRK4(I229L)), and a chimera (GIRK4-IRK1(K207-L245)). We found that GIRK4 chimera (GIRK4-IRK1(Lys207-Leu245)) and mutant (GIRK4(I229L)) channels (with strengthened channel-PIP2 interaction) showed much less mechanosensitivity and PKC sensitivity compared with wild-type GIRK4 chan- Mechanisms Underlying Mechanosensitivity of GIRK Channels 7045 FIG. IRK1 gained mechanosensitivity and PKC sensitivity by reverse double point mutation of the PIP2 binding domain (L222I/R213Q). The reverse single point mutants of the IRK1 channel (IRK1(L222I) and IRK1(R213Q)) showed relatively large basal currents (Fig. We, therefore, further constructed a reverse double point mutant, IRK1(L222I/R213Q), to obtain a greater modification of the channel-PIP2 interaction. Moreover, the reverse single point mutants, IRK1(L222I) and IRK1(R213Q), which presumably have weaker PIP2 affinity than wild-type IRK1, gained PKC sensitivity of a slower time course (Fig. Interestingly, the reverse double point mutant, IRK1(L222I/R213Q), was inhibited by PKC activation as rapidly as wild-type GIRK4. C, reverse single point mutants of IRK1 (IRK1(L222I) and IRK1(R213Q)) did not show mechanosensitivity. D, a reverse double point mutant of IRK1 (IRK1(L222I/R213Q)), which is expected to have weaker PIP2 affinity, gained mechanosensitivity, although the time course of current inhibition was slower than that of wild-type GIRK4. B, time course of changes in the whole cell current in response to 1 M PMA in oocytes expressing GIRK4(WT), IRK1(WT), reverse single point mutants of IRK1 (IRK1(L222I), and IRK1(R213Q)), and a double point mutant of IRK1 (IRK1(L222I/R213Q) (mean S.E., n 4 8). In contrast, IRK1 gained the mechanosensitivity and PKC sensitivity by reverse double point mutation of the PIP2 binding domain (L221/R213Q) to weaken the channel-PIP2 interaction. (37) recently found that mutations in IRK1 (R218Q and R218W), which alter Kir channel-PIP2 interaction, are associated with Anderson's syndrome, a disease characterized by periodic paralysis, cardiac arrhythmias, and dysmorphic features (36). Because the GIRK1 subunit has been reported not to form functional channels by itself when heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes (16), the mutant GIRK1(F137S) was used to make functional homomeric GIRK1 channels (17). Homomeric GIRK1(F137S) and heteromeric GIRK1/4 showed similar PKC sensitivity (inhibited by PMA, respectively, by 44.7 2.1%, n 10, p 0.01, and 45.5 1.8%, n 8, p 0.01) (Fig. A, whole cell current traces recorded with the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique before (control) and after hypo-osmotic challenge (hypo) causing swelling of oocytes that express heteromeric GIRK1/4, homomeric GIRK4, homomeric GIRK1(F137S), or IRK1 channels. The data were obtained from oocytes expressing GIRK1/4, GIRK4, GIRK1(F137S), or IRK1 channels (mean S.E., n 6 11).

This finding suggested that the 7.5-mV shift in V0.5 caused by the K291Q mutation and part of the shift observed for the quadruple mutant channel (for [Mg2 ]o 1.8 mM) could be due to loss of a positive surface charge normally contributed by the NH3 of Lys-291.

The surface expression of HA-tagged R312Q channels was reduced by 4-fold, consistent with the current reduction caused by this mutation. This correlation indicates that the reduction of current amplitude for R312Q was due to the partial loss of surface expression and not an alteration in single channel properties. The sequence of the clone was identical with the published HAC1 clone (3), except for a single nucleotide change causing a K283R substitution. Introduction of three point mutations into the S4 domain of Shaker (R365N/L366A/R371I) caused a 179 mV shift in the voltage dependence of channel activation (8). Mutation of Arg-309, Arg-315, or Arg-318 Causes Loss of Channel Function--In contrast with the mutations discussed above, mutation of Arg-309, Arg-315, or Arg-318 to Gln caused a complete loss of channel function, defined as lack of measurable current in response to a hyperpolarizing pulse to 140 mV. As predicted, K291E did produce an even greater shift in V0.5 ( 21.6-mV shift) than that caused by neutralization. However, elevation of [Mg2 ]o did not overcome the voltage shift in gating for K291E or R294Q, R297Q, or R300Q or the quadruple mutant as would be expected if due only to a surface charge-screening mechanism.

Due to the presence of endogenous inward Cl currents that also activated slowly and at very negative potentials, we could not pulse long enough at very negative potentials to obtain a reliable measure of the V0.5 for the activation of K303Q ntHCN2 channel current. These findings indicate that Lys-303 contributes significantly to voltage sensing, and that the K303Q mutation stabilizes a closed state of the channel. Luminometry experiments were performed on oocytes expressing mutant ntHCN2 constructs that either poorly expressed (K303Q, S306Q, R312Q) or exhibited complete loss of function (R309Q, R315Q, R318Q).

The surface expression of K303Q ntHCN2 channels was similar to WT ntHCN2 channels, but the voltage-dependent activation was very slow and shifted in the hyperpolarized direction. Comparison of gating currents for WT and K303Q HCN2 channels will be required to confirm this possibility. HA-tagged channels containing the other single mutations (D231N, D267N, and D275N) reduced surface expression by 58 75% (Fig.

(2001b) demonstrated that rNav1.4-D762K and rNav1.4-E765K mutant channels, which are resistant to GIIIB but not GIIIA, were also resistant to GIIIA-Q14R. In addition, although D762Q and E765Q substitutions rendered rNav1.4 resistant to GIIIB (Li et al., 2000), GIIIA binding was not affected by these same substitutions (Chahine et al., 1998b).

Therefore, we replaced S729 by threonine (S729T). The S729T channels were 2.5-fold less sensitive to GIIIB (IC50 121 15, n 6) compared with wild-type rNav1.4 channels (Fig. Our data showing that the S729L mutation reduced GIIIB sensitivity much more than the S729T mutation raises the possibility that a hydroxyl group in the side chain of the amino acid at this position could be an important determinant of GIIIB sensitivity. Therefore, we also introduced the N732K and the S729T/N732K replacements to examine their effect on GIIIB inhibition of rNav1.4. The double mutant S729T/N732K had a similar reduced sensitivity to GIIIB (IC50 995 159, n 6), suggesting no additive effect of the S729T mutation in this assay. E, S729T mutation has little effect on the GIIIB sensitivity of rNav1.4 channels. (2001b) also showed that although the GIIIB sensitivity of rNav1.4D762K and rNav1.4-E765K mutant channels was greatly reduced ( 200-fold), the GIIIA sensitivity of these channels was only slightly reduced ( 3-fold) compared with wild type rNav1.4 channels. (2001b) demonstrated that rNav1.4-D762K and rNav1.4-E765K mutant channels, which are resistant to GIIIB but not GIIIA, were also resistant to GIIIA-Q14R. Although the D762K and E765K mutations each reduced GIIIB affinity by 200-fold (Li et al., 2001b), the N732K mutation only reduced GIIIB affinity by 20-fold (data from present study). (1998b) proposed that this region of rNav1.4 did not contribute to the pore of the channel because neither cadmium nor a methanethiosulfonate reagent altered the permeation properties of rNav1.4-D730C mutant channels. GIIIA differs at three positions compared with GIIIB (K8R, Q14R, and Q18M; first residue is that of GIIIA). (2000) observed 2- to 10-fold discrepancies between the estimated Kd and IC50 values for GIIIB block of rNav1.4D762C and rNav1.4-E765C mutant channels, which also exhibit reduced sensitivity to GIIIB compared with wild-type rNav1.4 channels.

Therefore, we also introduced the N732Q replacement into rNav1.4. The sensitivity of rNav1.4 to GIIIB w 5 as not altered by the N732Q replacement (Fig. Because both of the N732K and N732Q replacements increase the size of the amino acid side chain at this position, but only the N732K replacement alters GIIIB sensitivity, the size of the side chain at this position does not seem to be a critical factor in determining GIIIB sensitivity. Both the rNav1.4-N732E and rNav1.4-N732Q replacements, which had no effect on GIIIB sensitivity, slightly increased the sensitivity of rNav1.4 channels to GIIIA (IC50 32 4 nM, n 6 and IC50 37 5 nM, n 6; p 0.01). B, N732Q mutation does not reduce GIIIB sensitivity. Interestingly, the N732Q mutation did not decrease GIIIB binding, and, therefore it is possible that the human Nav1.1 channel might be sensitive to GIIIB.

When N739 of rNav1.4 was replaced by histidine (N739H1), the corresponding residue in hNav1.4, the GIIIB sensitivity was still similar to that of wild-type rNav1.4 channels (Fig. C, N739H mutation does not alter the sensitivity of rNav1.4 channel to GIIIB. (2000) observed 2- to 10-fold discrepancies between the estimated Kd and IC50 values for GIIIB block of rNav1.4D762C and rNav1.4-E765C mutant channels, which also exhibit reduced sensitivity to GIIIB compared with wild-type rNav1.4 channels. Substitution of aspargine 732 with ly- sine (N732K), the corresponding residue in rNav1.1a and rNav1.7, reduced the GIIIB sensitivity of rNav1.4 by 20-fold. The N732K substitution, however, only reduced GIIIA sensitivity of rNav1.4 by 4-fold, demonstrating that GIIIA and GIIIB have distinct interactions with the D2/S5-S6 linker.

Therefore, we also introduced the N732K and the S729T/N732K replacements to examine their effect on GIIIB inhibition of rNav1.4. The sensitivity of rNav1.4 to GIIIB was significantly reduced by the N732K replacement (Fig. The double mutant S729T/N732K had a similar reduced sensitivity to GIIIB (IC50 995 159, n 6), suggesting no additive effect of the S729T mutation in this assay. The reduced sensitivity of rNav1.4-N732K channels to GIIIB shows that specific residues in the D2/S5-S6 linker of neuronal sodium channels are also likely to play a significant role in determining the sensitivity of these channels to the GIIIB toxin. Because both of the N732K and N732Q replacements increase the size of the amino acid side chain at this position, but only the N732K replacement alters GIIIB sensitivity, the size of the side chain at this position does not seem to be a critical factor in determining GIIIB sensitivity. However, because the N732K replacement alters the charge at this position, the basicity of the residue at this position may be important. The S729L and the N732K replacements individually altered the sensitivity of rNav1.4 channels for GIIIB by 20fold. To determine whether these mutations might have ad- ditive effects on GIIIB sensitivity, we tested the double mutant rNav1.4-S729L/N732K. In addition, although GIIIB sensitivity was reduced 20-fold by the N732K Fig. Determinants of Sodium Channel Block by -Conotoxins 1197 mutation, rNav1.4-N732K channels were only 4-fold less sensitive to GIIIA (IC50 228 37 nM, n 5; Fig. The double mutant S729L/ N732K also had less of an effect on GIIIA sensitivity than on GIIIB sensitivity. The GIIIA sensitivity of rNav1.4-S729L/ N732K channels (IC50 906 110 nM, n 5; Fig. The S729L and the N732K mutations individually altered the GIIIB IC50 of rNav1.4 channels by 20-fold, and the S729L/N732K double mutation altered the IC50 by 50-fold (Fig. Although GIIIB did not wash off appreciably from rNav1.4N732K channels, the on time constant ( on) was much slower Fig. A, rat Nav1.4 sodium channel with the N732K mutation exhibits reduced sensitivity to GIIIB inhibition. D, S729L/N732K mutation reduces the GIIIB sensitivity of rNav1.4 channels by more than 50-fold. for these channels than for wild-type rNav1.4 (383S for N732K channels versus 71S for WT rNav1.4 channels with 1200 nM GIIIB). Based on this and the very slow wash-off, we estimate that kon is at least 5-fold smaller for rNav1.4-N732K channels. To further investigate the effect of the N732K substitution we examined the kinetics of GIIIB block of rNav1.4-S729L/N732K channels using 1200 nM GIIIB. However, koff was 2-fold smaller for rNav1.4-S729L/N732K channels than for rNav1.4-S729L channels, and kon was almost 5-fold smaller for rNav1.4-S729L/N732K channels than for rNav1.4-S729L channels. Thus, although the S729L substitution considerably increases the off rate of GIIIB, the N732K substitution seems to significantly decrease the on rate (Table 2). E, N732K mutation, on the other hand, only reduces the sensitivity of rNav1.4 to GIIIA inhibition by 4-fold. F, S729L/N732K double mutation reduces the GIIIA sensitivity of rNav1.4 by slightly more than 15-fold. The S729L and N732K single mutants reduced GIIIB sensitivity of rNav1.4 channels by 20fold. These two mutants had a partially additive effect, and the rNav1.4 S729L/N732K double mutant showed a 50-fold reduction in the GIIIB sensitivity of rNav1.4. These kinetic data, together with the reduced effect of the N732K on GIIIA sensitivity, suggest that residues in the D2/S5-S6 linker can be more of an obstacle to GIIIB than GIIIA binding. However, the estimated Kd and IC50 values differed in some instances, with the Kd values being 3- to 4-fold smaller than the IC50 value for the more resistant constructs such as hNav1.4 and rNav1.4-S729L/N732K channels. We found that the N732K substitution also produced 20-fold reduction in rNav1.4 GIIIB sensitivity and the double mutant S729L/N732K decreased rNav1.4 GIIIB sensitivity by 50fold (Fig. The partially additive effect of two mutations, S729L and N732K, on increasing the resistance to toxin block suggests that multiple variant residues in the D2/S5-S6 linker, compared with rNav1.4, may contribute to the increased resistance of some neuronal channels. How Does D2/S5-S6 Linker Alter GIIIB Sensitivity? The S729L and N732K mutations each individually altered the GIIIB IC50 of rNav1.4 channels by 20-fold.

In the double mutant S729L/N732K both the on and off rates were significantly altered compared with wild-type rNav1.4, suggesting that the D2/S5-S6 linker affects both the accessibility of the pore to GIIIB and the stabilization of the toxin-channel complex. This indicates that although the effects of the S729L and N732K mutations are interdependent, S729 and N732 might facilitate related nonrate-limiting aspects of the toxin-channel interaction (Mildvan et al., 1992). In contrast, the N732K mutation decreased the on rate of toxin binding, suggesting that it interfered with the formation of an initial toxinchannel complex, and that N732 might control access of GIIIB to the high-affinity binding site. Our data show that although the sensitivity of rNav1.4 channels to both GIIIA and GIIIB was greatly reduced by the S729L mutation, the N732K mutation had a much smaller effect on GIIIA inhibition than on GIIIB inhibition. Although the D762K and E765K mutations each reduced GIIIB affinity by 200-fold (Li et al., 2001b), the N732K mutation only reduced GIIIB affinity by 20-fold (data from present study). Substitution of N732 with glutamine, which has a similarly sized side chain to lysine but has no charge, did not have an effect on GIIIB sensitivity, raising the possibility that the N732K mutation constitutes an electrostatic barrier that limits access of GIIIB to the high-affinity binding site. We propose that the naturally occurring resistance of various sodium channels to GIIIA and GIIIB -conotxins may arise from inhibition or destabilization of the slow formation of the initial toxin-channel complex and/or to enhanced reversibility of toxin block due to amino acid substitutions of specific extra-pore residues such as N732K and S729L. The E722D replacement in rNav1.1a, rNav1.2a, and rNav1.7a may not have a functional consequence. (1998b) found that mutations A728L and D730Q, near S729 and N732, caused a small decrease (5to 6-fold) in GIIIB inhibition of rNav1.4 channels.

To examine the role of the hydroxyl group of the side chain of S729 in GIIIB inhibition of rNav1.4, we replaced S729 with alanine (S729A). The GIIIB sensitivity of S729A channels (IC50 6 8 8, n 6) was similar to that of wild-type rNav1.4 channels (Fig. The S729A replacement clearly suggests that the hydroxyl group of this residue is not crucial for toxin binding. F, S729A mutation also has little effect on the GIIIB sensitivity of rNav1.4 channels. In addition, although D762Q and E765Q substitutions rendered rNav1.4 resistant to GIIIB (Li et al., 2000), GIIIA binding was not affected by these same substitutions (Chahine et al., 1998b). Exchange of serine 729 in the D2/S5-S6 linker of rat Nav1.4 with leucine (S729L), the corresponding residue in hNav1.4, reduces the sensitivity of rNav1.4 by 20-fold and largely accounts for the differential sensitivity of rNav1.4 and hNav1.4 to both GIIIA and GIIIB.

However, when S729 was replaced by leucine (S729L), the GIIIB sensitivity was simila 1 r to that of wild-type hNav1.4 channels (Fig. Our data showing that the S729L mutation reduced GIIIB sensitivity much more than the S729T mutation raises the possibility that a hydroxyl group in the side chain of the amino acid at this position could be an important determinant of GIIIB sensitivity. The S729L and the N732K replacements individually altered the sensitivity of rNav1.4 channels for GIIIB by 20fold. To determine whether these mutations might have ad- ditive effects on GIIIB sensitivity, we tested the double mutant rNav1.4-S729L/N732K. Similar to its effect on sensitivity to GIIIB, the S729L substitution significantly decreased (p 0.002) rNav1.4 sensitivity to -conotoxin GIIIA (IC50 778 74 nM, n 9; Fig. The double mutant S729L/ N732K also had less of an effect on GIIIA sensitivity than on GIIIB sensitivity. The GIIIA sensitivity of rNav1.4-S729L/ N732K channels (IC50 906 110 nM, n 5; Fig. 5F) was only reduced by 16-fold compared with wild-type rNav1.4 channels, and was similar to that of the single substitution S729L. The S729L and the N732K mutations individually altered the GIIIB IC50 of rNav1.4 channels by 20-fold, and the S729L/N732K double mutation altered the IC50 by 50-fold (Fig. GIIIB also washed-off rNav1.4-S729L mutant channels relatively easily ( off 46.6 2.8 s, n 4). The S729L mutation increased the koff of GIIIB by 20-fold but only increased kon by 2-fold (Table 2), suggesting that this mutation destabilizes the toxin-channel complex. D, S729L mutation decreases the sensitivity of rNav1.4 channels to GIIIB by 20-fold. D, S729L/N732K mutation reduces the GIIIB sensitivity of rNav1.4 channels by more than 50-fold. To further investigate the effect of the N732K substitution we examined the kinetics of GIIIB block of rNav1.4-S729L/N732K channels using 1200 nM GIIIB. However, koff was 2-fold smaller for rNav1.4-S729L/N732K channels than for rNav1.4-S729L channels, and kon was almost 5-fold smaller for rNav1.4-S729L/N732K channels than for rNav1.4-S729L channels. Thus, although the S729L substitution considerably increases the off rate of GIIIB, the N732K substitution seems to significantly decrease the on rate (Table 2). D, S729L mutation decreases the sensitivity of rNav1.4 to GIIIA by 15-fold. F, S729L/N732K double mutation reduces the GIIIA sensitivity of rNav1.4 by slightly more than 15-fold. The S729L and N732K single mutants reduced GIIIB sensitivity of rNav1.4 channels by 20fold. These two mutants had a partially additive effect, and the rNav1.4 S729L/N732K double mutant showed a 50-fold reduction in the GIIIB sensitivity of rNav1.4. However, the estimated Kd and IC50 values differed in some instances, with the Kd values being 3- to 4-fold smaller than the IC50 value for the more resistant constructs such as hNav1.4 and rNav1.4-S729L/N732K channels. We have identified a single amino acid substitution in this linker, S729L, that produces 20-fold reduction in the sensitivity of rNav1.4 to GIIIB and accounts for the difference between rNav1.4 and hNav1.4 GIIIB sensitivity. We found that the N732K substitution also produced 20-fold reduction in rNav1.4 GIIIB sensitivity and the double mutant S729L/N732K decreased rNav1.4 GIIIB sensitivity by 50fold (Fig. The difference in the effect of the replacement of the adjacent residues A728 and S729 by leucine (A728L and S729L cause 6- and 20-fold reduction in IC50, respectively) strongly suggests a more direct role of S729 in defining the sensitivity of rNav1.4 channels to the GIIIB toxin. The partially additive effect of two mutations, S729L and N732K, on increasing the resistance to toxin block suggests that multiple variant residues in the D2/S5-S6 linker, compared with rNav1.4, may contribute to the increased resistance of some neuronal channels. How Does D2/S5-S6 Linker Alter GIIIB Sensitivity? The S729L and N732K mutations each individually altered the GIIIB IC50 of rNav1.4 channels by 20-fold. Whereas the S729L mutation primarily increased the off rate of GIIIB, ko f f ( 10 3 /s) Kd nM IC50 nM n GIIIB 600 nM 600 nM 600 nM 1200 nM GIIIA 300 nM 300 nM 1200 nM rNav1.4 hNav1.4 S729L S729L/N732K rNav1.4 hNav1.4 hNav1.4 2.2 5.0 5.1 1.4 6.1 21.7 14.1 0.3 1.1 1.7 0.2 0.7 3.0 5.4 1.0 24.1 21.7 9.7 1.8 44.1 39.6 0.4 4.8 1.5 1.2 0.2 4.1 1.9 45 482 425 693 30 203 281 49 1357 1138 2554 55 1228 764 4 5 4 4 5 6 6 1200 Cummins et al. In the double mutant S729L/N732K both the on and off rates were significantly altered compared with wild-type rNav1.4, suggesting that the D2/S5-S6 linker affects both the accessibility of the pore to GIIIB and the stabilization of the toxin-channel complex. This indicates that although the effects of the S729L and N732K mutations are interdependent, S729 and N732 might facilitate related nonrate-limiting aspects of the toxin-channel interaction (Mildvan et al., 1992). The S729L substitution, which enhanced the toxin off rate, is likely to destabilize the toxin-channel complex and enhance reversibility of toxin block due to steric hindrance. Our data show that although the sensitivity of rNav1.4 channels to both GIIIA and GIIIB was greatly reduced by the S729L mutation, the N732K mutation had a much smaller effect on GIIIA inhibition than on GIIIB inhibition. We propose that the naturally occurring resistance of various sodium channels to GIIIA and GIIIB -conotxins may arise from inhibition or destabilization of the slow formation of the initial toxin-channel complex and/or to enhanced reversibility of toxin block due to amino acid substitutions of specific extra-pore residues such as N732K and S729L. (2001b) also showed that although the GIIIB sensitivity of rNav1.4D762K and rNav1.4-E765K mutant channels was greatly reduced ( 200-fold), the GIIIA sensitivity of these channels was only slightly reduced ( 3-fold) compared with wild type rNav1.4 channels. (2001b) demonstrated that rNav1.4-D762K and rNav1.4-E765K mutant channels, which are resistant to GIIIB but not GIIIA, were also resistant to GIIIA-Q14R. Although the D762K and E765K mutations each reduced GIIIB affinity by 200-fold (Li et al., 2001b), the N732K mutation only reduced GIIIB affinity by 20-fold (data from present study).

Therefore, we tested the N732E replacement to examine the effect of a negative charge at this position on GIIIB inhibition of rNav1.4. The sensitivity of rNav1.4 to GIIIB was not significantly affected by the N732E mutation (Fig. Both the rNav1.4-N732E and rNav1.4-N732Q replacements, which had no effect on GIIIB sensitivity, slightly increased the sensitivity of rNav1.4 channels to GIIIA (IC50 32 4 nM, n 6 and IC50 37 5 nM, n 6; p 0.01). C, rat Nav1.4 sodium channels with the N732E mutation also exhibit a GIIIB sensitivity similar to that of rNav1.4. If this idea is correct then it is not entirely clear why the N732E mutation did not enhance GIIIB binding. However, if the N732E mutation altered both the on and off kinetics for the formation of an intermediate, nonrate-limiting step in a reciprocal manner then the N732E mutation might not effect the rate at which the final toxin-channel complex is formed. (1998b) found that mutations A728L and D730Q, near S729 and N732, caused a small decrease (5to 6-fold) in GIIIB inhibition of rNav1.4 channels. The difference in the effect of the replacement of the adjacent residues A728 and S729 by leucine (A728L and S729L cause 6- and 20-fold reduction in IC50, respectively) strongly suggests a more direct role of S729 in defining the sensitivity of rNav1.4 channels to the GIIIB toxin.

As predicted, the difference between Nedd4 2 and Nedd4 2-P355L was smaller in the S448A background (Fig. Surprisingly, we now found an inverse relationship, i.e., Nedd4 2-P355L-S448A was slightly more potent in ENaC inhibition than Nedd4 2-S448A (Fig. 10D; compare columns N4 2/N4 2m Sgk1 with N4 2 S448A/N4 2m S448A Sgk1). Because P355 lies between the two other putative Sgk1 phosphorylation sites, S342 and T367, we tested if the mutation also had an impact on these sites and inactivated them together with S448A either in the wild-type or in the P355L background (Nedd4 2 P or Nedd4 2m P). N4 2 S/A (Nedd4 2-S448A) is less efficient in regulating ENaC than N4 2m S/A (Nedd4 2 P355L-S448A) in X. Differential effect of Sgk1 on either N4 2 3 P (Nedd4 2-S342AT367A-S448A)- or N4 2m 3 P-dependent regulation of ENaC. The observation that Nedd4 2-P355L-S448A is more efficient in ENaC inhibition than Nedd4 2-S448A, and the fact that additional mutation of S342 and T367 eliminates this difference, suggests that one or both of these sites are less phosphorylated in the presence of P355L. Several variants were identified, and one nonsynonymous mutation (Nedd4 2-P355L) was further characterized. However, in the Xenopus oocyte expression system, Nedd4 2-P355L-dependent ENaC inhibition was weaker compared with the wild type (Nedd4 2-WT), and this difference depended on the presence of intact PY-motifs on ENaC. When the phosphorylation level of human Nedd4 2 Ser448 (known to be phosphorylated by the Sgk1 kinase) was determined with a specific anti-pSer448 antibody, we observed stronger basal phosphorylation of Nedd4 2-P355L. In addition, the role of the two other putative Sgk1 phosphorylation sites (S342 and T367) appears also to be affected by the P355L mutation. Identification of the P355L mutation in the Nedd4 2 gene.

Splicing between exon 15 and 16 is equivalent between Nedd4 2-wild type (WT) and Nedd4 2-P355L. Among several variants (see Table 2), we identified a nonsynonymous mutation changing proline-355 to leucine (Nedd4 2-P355L). Nedd4 2-P355L is less efficient in regulating ENaC than wild-type Nedd4 2 in Xenopus laevis oocytes. A: top, immunoblot analysis using an anti-Nedd4 2 antibody indicating levels of expression of either hNedd4 2-WT (N4 2) or hNedd4 2-P355L (N4 2m) with increasing amounts of Nedd4 2 cRNA injected (ng/oocyte indicated). Regulatory influence of Nedd4 2-P355L over Nedd4 2-WT action on ENaC. Various ratios of cRNA encoding Nedd4 2-P355L (m) and Nedd4 2-WT (w) were injected in oocytes, and amiloride-sensitive Na currents were measured. Differential inhibition of Nedd4 2-WT or Nedd4 2-P355L depends on integrity of ENaC PY-motifs. Oocytes were coinjected with 3 ng each of cRNA encoding the ENaC subunits, either wild-type ENaC (ENaC) or PYmotif mutated (ENaC PY), and 5 ng Nedd4 2-WT (N4 2) or Nedd4 2P355L (N4 2m). We further characterized the mutation Nedd4 2-P355L observed in these two patients. Human Nedd4 2-WT and human Nedd4 2-P355L RNA are spliced in a similar fashion. The mutation P355L is localized very close to the 3 -donor site of exon 15 and may therefore potentially influence the splicing at this site (Fig. Human Nedd4 2-P355L is less efficient than wild-type human Nedd4 2 in downregulating ENaC in X. This prompted us to investigate if the P355L mutation affected the ability of Nedd4 2 to control ENaC activity. We injected increasing amounts of Nedd4 2-WT or Nedd4 2-P355L (Nedd4 2m) cRNA together with ENaC cRNA in X. In contrast, Nedd4 2-P355L consistently inhibited ENaC to a lesser extent. Similar expression of Nedd4 2-WT and Nedd4 2-P355L proteins was verified by Western blotting the lysates of the same oocytes using an anti Nedd4 2 antibody Fig. Nedd4 2-WT and Nedd4 2-P355L coimmunoprecipitate equally well with ENaC. Oocytes were injected with cRNA encoding FLAG-tagged rat ENaC (3 ng subunit 1 oocyte 1), together with Nedd4 2 or Nedd4 2-P355L (Nedd4 2m; 6 ng/oocyte) or as a control without FLAG-tagged rat ENaC. To further support the notion that Nedd4 2-P355L inhibited ENaC less efficiently, we looked at the mean absolute currents of 86 different experiments that we carried out under various conditions [rat or human (h) ENaC, hNedd4 2a or hNedd4 2c, different concentrations of injected Nedd4 2 cRNA]. When various Nedd4 2-WT-to-Nedd4 2- P355L ratios were injected with ENaC, we observed that increasing proportions of Nedd4 2-P355L yielded higher ENaC currents, corroborating the idea that this mutant is a weaker inhibitor of ENaC compared with wild-type Nedd4 2 (Fig. To ensure that the difference between Nedd4 2-WT and Nedd4 2-P355L is also depending on this interaction, we expressed ENaC channels with all PY-motifs disrupted by mutating the Fig. Phosphorylation of Ser448 differs between Nedd4 2-WT and Nedd4 2-P355L. A: oocytes were injected with cRNA encoding wild-type Nedd4 2 (N4 2) or Nedd4 2-P355L (N4 2m; 5 ng/oocyte) with and without serum- and glucocorticoidinduced kinase 1 (Sgk1; 10 ng); 10% of the lysate of 20 oocytes was analyzed by Western blot using an anti-Nedd4 2-pSer448, Nedd4 2, myc (Sgk1), or actin antibody. When Nedd4 2-WT or Nedd4 2P355L (Nedd4 2m) was coexpressed with wild-type ENaC, the activity was significantly decreased, with Nedd4 2-WT being more efficient in inhibiting ENaC activity than Nedd4 2-P355L, as observed before. However, no effect either by Nedd4 2 or by Nedd4 2-P355L was observed with ENaCPY, suggesting that both forms of Nedd4 2 regulate ENaC via WW-domain-PY-motif interaction (Fig. Both Nedd4 2-WT and Nedd4 2-P355L interact with ENaC in X. The reduced effect of Nedd4 2-P355L on ENaC activity could be the result of either 1) reduced enzymatic Nedd4 2 activity or 2) reduced interaction with ENaC. We carried out coimmunoprecipitation experiments between ENaC and either Nedd4 2-WT or Nedd4 2-P355L in X. When either Nedd4 2-WT or Nedd4 2-P355L was added, a supplementary band at 120 kDa was coimmunoprecipitated, corresponding to the predicted molecular weight of Nedd4 2 (Fig. We observed no obvious difference in the amount of coimmunoprecipitated hNedd4 2-WT or hNedd4 2-P355L, suggesting that both forms of Nedd4 2 bind ENaC with comparable apparent affinity. The level of Ser448 phosphorylation is different between Nedd4 2-WT and Nedd4 2-P355L. Remarkably, when Sgk1 was absent, Nedd4 2-P355L (Nedd4 2m) was stronger phosphorylated than Nedd4 2-WT (compare lane 8 with 9 in Fig. When we coexpressed Sgk1, the phosph-Ser448 signal was increased for Nedd4 2-WT by 4.5-fold, whereas the signal for Nedd4 2P355L increased only 2-fold (Fig. 9A, Sgk1 increased, whereas Nedd4 2-WT and (to a lesser extent) Nedd4 2-P355L (Nedd4 2m) decreased, ENaC Fig. A: oocytes were coinjected with cRNA encoding ENaC (3 ng subunit 1 oocyte 1), Nedd4 2-WT (N4 2), or Nedd4 2P355L (N4 2m; 5 ng/oocyte), with or without Sgk1 (10 ng/oocyte). Nedd4 2-P355L in the absence of Sgk1; n 24 oocytes from 4 animals/ data point. When Sgk1 was coexpressed with Nedd4 2 or Nedd4 2-P355L, the inhibition was reversed, and stimulation of ENaC was observed, as reported previously (7). 9, A and B), whereas it affected the current with Nedd4 2-P355L less strongly (7.5-fold), yielding currents that were not distinguishable between wild-type and mutant Nedd4 2 (Fig. If differential level of Ser448 phosphorylation is the explanation for the difference in ENaC inhibition between Nedd4 2 and Nedd4 2-P355L, one may expect that mutation of Ser448 will abolish such dissimilarity. As predicted, the difference between Nedd4 2 and Nedd4 2-P355L was smaller in the S448A background (Fig. Surprisingly, we now found an inverse relationship, i.e., Nedd4 2-P355L-S448A was slightly more potent in ENaC inhibition than Nedd4 2-S448A (Fig. P355L affects other putative Sgk1 phosphorylation sites as well. The observation that mutation of S448 did not completely abolish but rather inversed the difference between wild type and Nedd4 2-P355L suggested that this mutation also affects other regions in Nedd4 2. Because P355 lies between the two other putative Sgk1 phosphorylation sites, S342 and T367, we tested if the mutation also had an impact on these sites and inactivated them together with S448A either in the wild-type or in the P355L background (Nedd4 2 P or Nedd4 2m P). N4 2 S/A (Nedd4 2-S448A) is less efficient in regulating ENaC than N4 2m S/A (Nedd4 2 P355L-S448A) in X. A: top, immunoblot analysis using an anti-Nedd4 2 antibody, indicating levels of expression of either hNedd4 2 S/A or hNedd4 2 P355L S/A with increasing amounts of different mutant Nedd4 2 cRNA injected (ng/oocyte as indicated). Moreover, in this background, the mutation P355L did not affect the ability of Nedd4 2 to regulate ENaC currents (compare columns N4 2 P with N4 2m P), suggesting that this mutation indeed also affects the other putative Sgk1 phosphorylation sites. DISCUSSION Our data reveal the existence of a naturally occurring human Nedd4 2 variant (P355L) that affects the property to regulate the epithelial Na channel ENaC when expressed in X. This difference can be explained by the fact that, in Nedd4 2P355L, Ser448 is stronger phosphorylated by an endogenous kinase and therefore expected to display weaker interaction with ENaC. N4 2m (N4 2P355L) in the absence of Sgk1; n 24 oocytes from 4 animals/condition. Here, we have focused on the properties of Nedd4 2P355L, one of the two nonsynonymous mutants, and analyzed it with respect to ENaC regulation in X. Notably, the two other putative Sgk1-dependent phosphorylation sites (S342 and T367), which are situated in close proximity to P355, appear to be affected as well by the P355L mutation, although to a lesser extent. The observation that Nedd4 2-P355L-S448A is more efficient in ENaC inhibition than Nedd4 2-S448A, and the fact that additional mutation of S342 and T367 eliminates this difference, suggests that one or both of these sites are less phosphorylated in the presence of P355L. Although Nedd4 2-P355L is stronger phosphorylated on Ser448 than wild-type Nedd4 2, we are not able to detect any differences between mutant and wild-type Nedd4 2 in our coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. This might be explained by the small change in impact on ENaC activity and phosphorylation state of S448 that we observed between wild-type and P355L mutant. What is the biological relevance of such a Nedd4 2 mutation? The two patients with the Nedd4 2-P355L mutation could not be investigated with respect to abnormal renal sodium and potassium handling and blood pressure-regulating hormones. In summary, we have shown that the naturally occurring P355L mutant of human Nedd4 2 inhibits ENaC less efficiently in X.

Conclusions--We characterized the genetics and molecular pathophysiology of a novel SCN5A sodium channel mutation, E1784K. The presence of the specific mutation (E1784K) reported in this study was confirmed independently on PCR-amplified genomic DNA using an allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization assay with a 32P endlabeled primer (5 -AGAGCACCAAGCCCCTG-3 ).

Voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation and time course of recovery from inactivation for WT-hH1 and E1784K. Midpoint of steady-state inactivation (V1/2) is as follows: WT-hH1, 74.1 0.9 mV (n 7); WT-hH1 h 1, 63.2 1.3 mV (n 10); E1784K, 79.3 0.5 mV (n 20); and E1784K h 1, 75.3 0.9 mV (n 11). Significant differences exist between WT-hH1 and WT-hH1 h 1 (P 0.0001), between E1784K and E1784K h 1 (P 0.01), and between WT-hH1 h 1 and E1784K h 1 (P 0.0001). Time constants ( 1, 2) for recovery from inactivation are as follows (amplitude of each component expressed as a percentage of total current given in parentheses): WT-hH1 h 1 (n 10), 1 2.2 0.2 ms (84%), 2 166.9 2.2 ms (16%); E1784K h 1 (n 11), 1 1.8 0.2 ms (76%), 2 86.5 7.4 ms (24%); P 0.005 for 2 only. We versus E1784K h 1 also observed a small but significant change in the time course of recovery from inactivation elicited by a 500-ms prepulse (Figure 5B). The functional disturbances observed with oocytes expressing E1784K are similar to previously observed functional defects in 3 other LQTS SCN5A mutations24 26 and are consistent with a molecular lesion being responsible for the disease. Functional characterization of this mutant revealed a pattern of channel gating similar to E1784K. The apparent defect in channel inactivation was further quantified by fitting the decay phase of both WT-hH1 and E1784K current traces with double exponential functions. Time constants for the fast phase of inactivation were indistinguishable ( fast, WT-hH1 1.3 0.06, n 10, versus E1784K 1.3 0.06, n 23), but the time constant of the slow component was significantly larger in the mutant ( slow, W T - h H 1 12.1 0 . Coexpression with h 1 produced currents that differed significantly in the fast time constant of inactivation, largely because of an effect on E1784K ( fast, WThH1 1.2 0.03, n 31, versus E1784K 0.94 0.03, n 39; P 0.0001). The mutation we describe in this article (E1784K) occurs in a highly conserved acidic domain located in the early carboxy terminal segment of the sodium channel protein. The allelic variant causes substitution of Lys for Glu1606 in SCN4A, only a few amino acids away from the corresponding residues in SCN5A that cause LQTS when substituted (E1784K, D1790G).13 The functional characterization of the skeletal-muscle sodium channel allele has not yet been reported. Steady-state inactivation and recovery from inactivation for WT-hH1, E1784K, Q-I, and Q-II. the accentuation of the functional defect by the 1 subunit is also apparent in our work on E1784K. The functional characteristics of E1784K closely resemble the gating disturbances observed for many other SCN5A LQTS mutations.24 26 This defect is characterized by a small, persistent, inward current during long depolarizations that is expected to contribute to the delay in myocardial repolarization. One mutation (Q-I) consisting of 4 Gln substitutions for Glu at positions 1773, 1780, 1781, and 1784 was constructed using the forward primer 5'-GTGGTCAACATGTACATTGCCATCATCCTGCAGAAC TTCAGCGTGGCCACGCAGCAGAGTACTCAGCCCCTGAGTGAGGACGA-3' (changed codons underlined) and the previously described reverse primer

These changes comprised of G1663A and G5227A were both heterozygous and found in patient 1B and 2B, respectively, but neither of them was detected in additional 48 control subjects. G1663A and A1673G are heterozygous and cause changes from glutamic acid to lysine and from histidine to arginine, respectively. We found three non-synonymous nucleotide changes, G1663A, A1673G, and G5227A, specific to our Brugada patients. We could not specify the pathogenetic responsibility of two non-synonymous nucleotide changes, G1663A and G5227A in Brugada patients. We found two non-synonymous nucleotide changes, G1663A and G5227A, in a Japanese Brugada patient, but further study is required to evaluate the pathogenetic responsibility of these nucleotide changes. As a nucleotide substitution (G3578A) was detected from the reverse reading, a forward primer (5VATCTCTTCAACCATCCAACCTTCT- 3V was designed and further sequencing ) of exon 20 was carried out with this forward primer and a nucleotide substitution (G3578A) was confirmed by the forward reading. / Life Sciences 72 (2003) 23912399 Table 3 Non-synonymous nucleotide changes observed in Japanese patients and normal controls Exon Nucleotide Changes 3 Coding Effects Patients 1B 2B 3B +/ + 4B +/ + 5B +/ + 6B +/ + Controls 1N +/ + 2N +/ + 3N +/ + 4N +/ + 5N +/ + Reference 5 12 12 12 17 17 18 20 28 AG357V120I +/ + +/ + 8CA + T360G CT539A180G +/ + +/ + 40GC C1654G R552G +/ + +/ + G1663A E555K +/ / A1673G H558R +/ / C2961G H987Q +/ + +/ + A3080G Q1027R +/ + +/ + 3252delC + WPRG1085 - +/ + +/ + 3263insC 8GPEA G3578A R1193Q +/ / G5227A G1743R / +/ +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / [1] +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + +/ + / / / / +/ / / / / / / / / / / / / / Symbol meaning is the same as Table 2.

We found three non-synonymous nucleotide changes, G1663A, A1673G, and G5227A, specific to our Brugada patients. We could not specify the pathogenetic responsibility of two non-synonymous nucleotide changes, G1663A and G5227A in Brugada patients. We found two non-synonymous nucleotide changes, G1663A and G5227A, in a Japanese Brugada patient, but further study is required to evaluate the pathogenetic responsibility of these nucleotide changes. A number of mutations, such as L567Q [16], R1232W [7], V1398Term [7], R1432G [4,8], R1512W [8,14], T1620M [7], S1710L (a non-Brugada type idiopathic VF) [1], 1795insD [3,5], Y1795H [13] and A1924T [14], have been found in the SCN5A gene of patients with Brugada syndrome and their pedigrees.

10608820	AC Membrane Translocation and Hemolytic Activity of ACT Are Modulated by the Net Charge of the -Helix Including Glutamates 509 and 516 --The E509V and E509Q substitutions allowed nearly wild-type toxin activity, showing that a negative charge at these position is not essential. Combination of the E509K and E516K mutations in a single molecule further exacerbated hemolytic and channel forming activity and ablated translocation of the AC domain into cells. 2, the E509K substitution, which shifted the charge of the putative -helix from 2 to 0, caused about 2-fold reduction in both cell association activity and cell-invasive activity of the mutant, as compared with intact ACT. Because cell association is a prerequisite for AC translocation into cells, it can be concluded that the primary defect of these mutants was in reduced cell association and that once the E509K and/or E516K toxin molecules integrated into target membranes, they exhibited an efficiency of AC domain translocation similar to that of the intact ACT. Hence, per unit of cell-associated E509K and E516K mutants, their specific hemolytic activity was about 4 times higher than that of intact ACT. Although the cell association remained similar to that of the single mutants, the cell-invasive activity of the E509K/E516K double mutant was abolished, and the hemolytic activity was further enhanced by another factor of 2 (Fig. When compared on the basis of units of cell-associated toxin, the hemolytic activity of the double mutant was about 8 times higher than that of intact toxin, and the E509K/E516K mutant induced much faster erythrocyte lysis (Fig. The E509K and E516K Substitutions Enhance Membrane Activity of ACT and Alter Ion Selectivity of ACT Channels Formed in Lipid Bilayers--It was important to analyze the molecular basis of the exacerbated hemolytic activity of the FIG. E509K and E516K mutant toxins. Therefore, the conductanceconcentration relationship of the E509K with enhanced hemolytic activity was compared with that of wild-type ACT. 4 shows the results of these measurements for wild-type ACT and the mutant E509K. This means that the relationship between ACT-induced conductance increase in membranes and toxin concentration was not linear and could Adenylate Cyclase Toxin Point Mutants 37647 TABLE III Average single-channel conductances of different ACT mutants ACT Average single channel conductancea G/pS Membrane activityb E Wild-type ACT E509K E516K a 509K/E516K 27 24 28 26 The membranes were formed of asolectin dissolved in n-decane. Equal amounts of cell-associated E509K/E516K mutant ACT induce much faster hemolysis than intact ACT. Sheep erythrocytes (5 108/ml) were incubated in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl at 37 C with 0.56 units/ml of the E509K/E516K ACT and 0.32 units/ml of the intact ACT. The steep conductance-concentration dependences of intact recombinant ACT and of its E509K mutant form indicate that an association-dissociation reaction is responsible for the formation of conductive oligomers from nonconductive monomers. be fitted to a straight line with a slope of approximately 23 on a double-logarithmic scale, which was approximately similar for ACT and its E509K mutant. As shown in Table III and in agreement with the observed enhanced specific hemolytic activities, the specific membrane conductance in 1 M KCl generated at a concentration of 13 ng/ml was highest for the double mutant E509K/E516K (1.9 S/cm2), followed by E516K (0.37 S/cm2) and by E509K (0.34 S/cm2), as compared with that of wild-type ACT (0.10 S/cm2). Therefore, only the difference of membrane activity between wild-type ACT and the mutants and between the single mutants and the double mutant can be considered significant, but the activity difference between the E509K and E516K mutants cannot. As summarized in Table III and illustrated by the single-channel recording with the ACT-mutant E509K/E516K in Fig. 5, the channels formed by the E509K, E516K, and E509K/E516K mutants had, on average, a singlechannel conductance between 24 and 28 pS, which can be considered identical to the conductance of channels formed by wild-type ACT. Single-channel recording (A) of an asolectin/n-decane membrane in the presence of 20 ng/ml of the purified E509K/E516K mutant ACT.

With the single mutations, the zero current membrane potentials decreased from 39 to 33 mV (E509K) and to 25 mV (E516K) on the more dilute side of the membrane, respectively. On the other hand, the conductances of single channels formed by the E509K and E516K mutants show that the enhanced hemolytic activity of the mutant ACT is due to the increased propensity of the proteins to form membrane channels and that the size and structure of their channels (conductance) are not grossly affected by the mutations. However, it has to be located very close to the channel, because the E509K and E516K substitutions strongly reduce the cation selectivity of the channel and modulate the frequency of its formation. Positively charged residues are the least frequently found residues in transmembrane protein segments (37, 38), and the reduced cell association capacity of the E509K and E516K mutants is compatible with a partial inhibition of membrane insertion of the analyzed segment. The E509K and E516K substitutions reverse the net electrostatic charge on the hydrophilic face of the predicted amphipathic -helix. B, proposed model for the activity of the E509K/E516K mutant ACT. The selective loss of AC translocation capacity upon proline substitution at position 509 and/or the combined E509K/E516K mutation suggest that a segment was mutagenized, which is critical for the type of membrane interaction that yields AC translocation. However, whereas raise in temperature or calcium concentration still allows the intact channel precursors to translocate their AC into cells (23), the E509P and E509K/ E516K mutations appear to lock the channel precursor in a conformation that prevents translocation of the AC domain. However, it enhances the propensity of channel precursors to associate within membrane, which accounts for the increased frequency of channel formation and exacerbated hemolytic activity of the E509K/ E516K mutant ACT. 2, substitution of Glu-509 by a helix-breaking proline residue selectively abolished the membrane translocation of the AC domain without affecting the hemolytic activity and the cell association capacity of the ACTE509P mutant. A helix-breaking substitution (E509P) selectively blocked AC translocation across target membrane, but not the membrane insertion and channel formation. Moreover, the helix breaking substitution E509P also did not affect the channel forming and hemolytic activity of ACT. The E509P mutation (not depicted) breaks the -helix and selectively ablates AC delivery into cells by AC translocation precursors, without interfering with their membrane insertion and/or with membrane insertion and function of channel precursors. This yields normal membrane insertion and channel forming activity of E509P-ACT. However, whereas raise in temperature or calcium concentration still allows the intact channel precursors to translocate their AC into cells (23), the E509P and E509K/ E516K mutations appear to lock the channel precursor in a conformation that prevents translocation of the AC domain.

Combination of the E509K and E516K mutations in a single molecule further exacerbated hemolytic and channel forming activity and ablated translocation of the AC domain into cells.

The selective loss of AC translocation capacity upon proline substitution at position 509 and/or the combined E509K/E516K mutation suggest that a segment was mutagenized, which is critical for the type of membrane interaction that yields AC translocation. However, whereas raise in temperature or calcium concentration still allows the intact channel precursors to translocate their AC into cells (23), the E509P and E509K/ E516K mutations appear to lock the channel precursor in a conformation that prevents translocation of the AC domain. However, it enhances the propensity of channel precursors to associate within membrane, which accounts for the increased frequency of channel formation and exacerbated hemolytic activity of the E509K/ E516K mutant ACT.

Ionic currents through the Kv2.1 I379C channel can be completely blocked by cysteine-modifying reagents (Kurz et al., 1995). 9 A illustrates four superimposed gating currents from Kv2.1 I379C. 9 C illustrates a family of gating currents evoked from MTSET-modified Kv2.1 I379C, generated by depolarizations between 80 and 60 mV, recorded in the presence of symmetrical 3 mM [K ]. Gating currents in Kv2.1 I379C were examined at different membrane potentials under two conditions, 0 mM K (Fig. K does not speed gating charge movement by shifting voltaged e p e n d e n c e : use of Kv2.1 I379C. (A) Four superimposed (normalized) traces are shown from four different cells containing the mutant channel Kv2.1 I379C. (D) Q-V curve from Kv2.1 I379C under two conditions: in the absence of K (no MTSET treatment) and in the presence of symmetrical 3 mM K after pretreatment with MTSET. Gating currents were recorded in Kv2.1 I379C under two conditions: 0 internal and external K (filled circles) and 3 mM symmetrical K plus MTSET (open squares). 6 B) from two channels, wild-type Kv2.1 and the well-characterized mutant channel, Kv2.1 K356G K382V. 7, A and B, illustrate that 3 mM K had essentially no effect on the rate of gating charge movement in Kv2.1 K356G K382V. The K -dependent effect remained in Kv2.1 K382V (which contained the lysine at position 356; Fig. Comparison of Q-V curves for wild-type Kv2.1 and the mutant, Kv2.1 K356G K382V.

Second, it is not clear how a selective mutation of one amino acid residue (K356) in the turret of the outer vestibule could abolish the effect of K on Qon, nor how chemical modification of K356C in the outer vestibule by MTSET could reinstate the K -dependent speeding of Qon, if the effect of K were transmitted via the internal gate with no involvement of the outer vestibule. 6 B) from two channels, wild-type Kv2.1 and the well-characterized mutant channel, Kv2.1 K356G K382V. 7, A and B, illustrate that 3 mM K had essentially no effect on the rate of gating charge movement in Kv2.1 K356G K382V. 7 C) and was completely abolished by the K356G mutation alone (Fig. Just as with the K356G mutation, mutation of K356 to a cysteine abolished the K -dependent speeding of Qon (Fig. Comparison of Q-V curves for wild-type Kv2.1 and the mutant, Kv2.1 K356G K382V. (A and B) Superimposed (normalized) gating currents from two different cells, one that contained Kv2.1 channels and one that contained Kv2.1 K356G K382V.

10722683	A point mutation of the GluR 2 (A654T) glutamate receptor subunit converts it into a functional channel, and a spontaneous mutation at this site is through to be responsible for the neurodegeneration of neurons in the Lurcher mouse. In this mutation, a substitution of non-polar alanine with a threonine occurs at position 654. A single-site mutation in the S1 region of GluR3 (L507Y) is sufficient to eliminate desensitization without changing most other properties of binding and channel gating (19). We show here that site-directed mutagenesis of the homologous alanine (A636T; GluR1-Lc) in the GluR1 AMPA receptor subunit alters its channel properties. To explore the possible role of this region in channel gating, we constructed a mutated GluR1 (flop) subunit with a threonine substituted for the alanine (A636T, GluR1-Lc) at the homologous position of the Lurcher mutation of the GluR 2 subunit. 
11846401	The expression of currents through H587X of ECaC2 in the presence of BAPTA. Functional Expression of Mutants of ECaC2 H587X To evaluate the role of the H587 in ECaC2, various amino acids from acidic to basic were introduced at this position. The expression of currents through H587X of ECaC2 in CHO cells. Possible StructureFunction Relation of H587X One of the explanations of the structurefunction relation is derived from a calculation (HyperChem, ver6.0, Hypercube, U.S.A.) of the alignment underlined in Fig. Mutations in the leucine (L) residue of ECaC1 at position 566 and the phenylalanine (F) of ECaC2 at position 574 did not change whole-cell currents in these four, wild-type ECaC1, ECaC1 L566F, wild-type ECaC2, and EcaC2 F574L, in Xenopus oocytes or in CHO cells. Currents of H587C and H587N were not detected, and the H587R diminished the rate of rapid decay. The rapid decay was exaggerated in H587C and H587N mutants but was undetectable in the H587R mutant. (A) Representative traces of water-injected oocytes, expressing wild-type ECaC2, H587C, and H587N after the treatment with 50 M BAPTA and H587R without BAPTA treatment are shown. Left: ECaC2 (closed circle), BAPTA-treated ECaC2 (open circle), H587N (closed square), BAPTA-treated H587N (open square), H587R (open diamond). Mutants H587L, H587C, H587N, and H587R were made. The magnitude of the currents at a given voltage was the same as the wild-type for the H587L, H587Q and H587R mutants; however, it was markedly reduced in the H587N mutant and undetectable in the H587C mutant. Analysis of the fast decay measured at a voltage of 100 mV from 10 to 250 ms resulted in that the time-constant differed: it was unchanged in H587L, double in H587Q, and almost absent (less than 100 ms) in H587R and in the wild-type after treatment with BAPTA. Compared to staining of controlling cells, positive fluorescence was observed in oocytes injected with wild-type ECaC2, or the H587L or H587R mutants. Functional Expression of H587C, H587R, and H587N Mutants in CHO Cells A more detailed analysis was performed using CHO cells because of the tight seal achieved by patch clamping. H587R expressed a large current without fast decay (n 6). ECaC2 H587N increased while H587R decreased the time constant of the decay. (A) Representative traces of wild-type ECaC2, as well as H587R, H587C, and H587N mutants with a pipet of pCa 7.6. In contrast, decay was nominally absent in H587R, even without BAPTA treatment. Expression of the ECaC1 mutant Q579H and a H587Q mutation in ECaC2 in Xenopus oocytes resulted in a possible change in the rate of fast decay. Single Point Mutations of Q579H in ECaC1 and H587Q in ECaC2 Because the Ca selective site locates the poreforming domain at a position upstream of the 6th TMS FIG. The expression of currents through wild-type ECaC1, ECaC2, the Q579H mutant of ECaC1 and the H587Q mutant of ECaC2. (A) Representative traces of wild-type ECaC1, ECaC2, as well as mutants Q579H, and H587Q are shown. ECaC1 (closed circle), Q579H (open circle), ECaC2 (closed triangle), H587Q (closed triangle). ECaC1 Q579H and ECaC2 H587Q did not reveal any differences in the currentvoltage relation or in the rundown in the presence or absence of BAPTA, while the rate of fast decay was altered in these mutants. Wild-type ECaC2 showed a time-constant around 200 ms, while ECaC2 H587Q resulted in one of 400 ms. The magnitude of the currents at a given voltage was the same as the wild-type for the H587L, H587Q and H587R mutants; however, it was markedly reduced in the H587N mutant and undetectable in the H587C mutant. Analysis of the fast decay measured at a voltage of 100 mV from 10 to 250 ms resulted in that the time-constant differed: it was unchanged in H587L, double in H587Q, and almost absent (less than 100 ms) in H587R and in the wild-type after treatment with BAPTA. ECaC1 Q579H showed a slower not faster decay than wild-type being similar to wild-type ECaC2, while ECaC2 H587Q had a similar time-constant as ECaC1, though not reaching to a significant difference. We made the mutants H587A, H587P, and H587F and measured their time-constant at 100 mV (n 3 each), resulting in 3.8, 9.0, and 10.1 ms (mean), respectively. Expression of the ECaC1 mutant Q579H and a H587Q mutation in ECaC2 in Xenopus oocytes resulted in a possible change in the rate of fast decay. Single Point Mutations of Q579H in ECaC1 and H587Q in ECaC2 Because the Ca selective site locates the poreforming domain at a position upstream of the 6th TMS FIG. The expression of currents through wild-type ECaC1, ECaC2, the Q579H mutant of ECaC1 and the H587Q mutant of ECaC2. (A) Representative traces of wild-type ECaC1, ECaC2, as well as mutants Q579H, and H587Q are shown. ECaC1 (closed circle), Q579H (open circle), ECaC2 (closed triangle), H587Q (closed triangle). ECaC1 Q579H and ECaC2 H587Q did not reveal any differences in the currentvoltage relation or in the rundown in the presence or absence of BAPTA, while the rate of fast decay was altered in these mutants. Wild-type ECaC1 showed a time-constant around 400 ms, while ECaC1 Q579H revealed one around 200 ms. ECaC1 Q579H showed a slower not faster decay than wild-type being similar to wild-type ECaC2, while ECaC2 H587Q had a similar time-constant as ECaC1, though not reaching to a significant difference. Either the distance of N to C13 or the angle of N-C7-C13 was related to the time-constant, while the distances C7-C13 and C7-N were not. Currents of H587C and H587N were not detected, and the H587R diminished the rate of rapid decay. The rapid decay was exaggerated in H587C and H587N mutants but was undetectable in the H587R mutant. (A) Representative traces of water-injected oocytes, expressing wild-type ECaC2, H587C, and H587N after the treatment with 50 M BAPTA and H587R without BAPTA treatment are shown. Left: ECaC2 (closed circle), BAPTA-treated ECaC2 (open circle), H587N (closed square), BAPTA-treated H587N (open square), H587R (open diamond). Mutants H587L, H587C, H587N, and H587R were made. The magnitude of the currents at a given voltage was the same as the wild-type for the H587L, H587Q and H587R mutants; however, it was markedly reduced in the H587N mutant and undetectable in the H587C mutant. All the mutants including H587N and H587C revealed similar large currents. Therefore, H587C and H587N might be functionally expressed, even though currents were not detected in the oocytes until they were treated with BAPTA. The H587N protein was faintly detected on the plasma membrane and diffusely observed in the cytoplasm. Functional Expression of H587C, H587R, and H587N Mutants in CHO Cells A more detailed analysis was performed using CHO cells because of the tight seal achieved by patch clamping. On the other hand, H587C and H587N revealed marked characteristics in their fast decay (n 4). The resultant values in H587C and H587N were higher than those in the wild-type ECaC2. As in the control, the mean time constant of H587C was unrelated to the voltage, while the mean time constant of H587N was voltage-dependent within the range provided. Traces of H587N and H587C appeared similar but were discriminated at the voltage of 100 mV. ECaC2 H587N increased while H587R decreased the time constant of the decay. ECaC2 H587N and H587C were not active in oocytes. (A) Representative traces of wild-type ECaC2, as well as H587R, H587C, and H587N mutants with a pipet of pCa 7.6.

The voltage-dependence of the time constant was observed in ECaC2 H587N, while not in other mutants and wild-type of ECaC2. Unexpectedly, ECaC2 H587N and H587C showed small currents. The immunofluorescence of H587N on the membrane was less than that of the control, while that of H587C was similar to the positive control. In contrast to the poor currents, treatment with BAPTA to chelate intracellular Ca 2 resulted in a large current, which was similar among the wild-type, and H587N and H587C mutants.

Therefore, H587C and H587N might be functionally expressed, even though currents were not detected in the oocytes until they were treated with BAPTA.

In contrast to the poor currents, treatment with BAPTA to chelate intracellular Ca 2 resulted in a large current, which was similar among the wild-type, and H587N and H587C mutants. We made the mutants H587A, H587P, and H587F and measured their time-constant at 100 mV (n 3 each), resulting in 3.8, 9.0, and 10.1 ms (mean), respectively. We made the mutants H587A, H587P, and H587F and measured their time-constant at 100 mV (n 3 each), resulting in 3.8, 9.0, and 10.1 ms (mean), respectively. Mutations in the leucine (L) residue of ECaC1 at position 566 and the phenylalanine (F) of ECaC2 at position 574 did not change whole-cell currents in these four, wild-type ECaC1, ECaC1 L566F, wild-type ECaC2, and EcaC2 F574L, in Xenopus oocytes or in CHO cells.

12874219	The P2X7-S342F, S342Y, and S342A mutants were created by a similar strategy using different primers. A, Immunoblotting of cell lysates from RAW 264.7 cells or HEK cells transfected with either wild-type or mutant (S342F, S342A, S342Y) P2X7 using a polyclonal Ab that recognizes an epitope within the C-terminal domain of P2X7. Because mutations introducing bulky residues in transmembrane domains have been shown to influence protein folding of other receptor systems (33), we also created the tyrosine and alanine mutants, P2X7-S342Y and P2X7-S342A. By contrast, the S342A mutant is robustly expressed and is effectively routed to the cell surface (Fig. Preliminary data suggest that the S342A mutant is functional (29.7-fold stimulation of Bz-ATP-induced YO-PRO-1 uptake vs 1.0- and 1.0-fold for the S342F and S342Y mutants, respectively), and that growth at room temperature is not sufficient to substantially restore the pore activities of the S342F and S342Y mutants (2.3- and 0.9-fold, respectively). In this regard, we have observed a correlation between receptor expression level and the relative capacity to form pores in sorted populations of HEK cells expressing P2X7-S342A receptors (data not shown). Additionally, two P2X7 mutants with bulky amino acid substitutions within the second transmembrane domain (S342F and S342Y, but not S342A) have reduced protein expression (Fig. In contrast with the wild-type receptor, the P2X7-R578E/K579E mutant fails to demonstrate surface immunoreactivity despite normal levels of total protein expression. Despite surface expression at reduced temperatures, at 25C the P2X7-R578E/K579E mutant still exhibits greatly reduced sodium, potassium, and calcium channel activity when compared with the wild-type receptor, and cannot induce pore formation. Construction of the human P2X7-R578E/K579E mutant Two point mutations in the P2X7 cDNA that are necessary for the desired 2 aa change were introduced by PCR using the following primers (Operon Technologies, Alameda, CA): BsrGI sense: 5 -AATTTGACATTATCCA GCTGGTGGTGTACA; BsrGI antisense: 5 -GAAACTCTTCCTCGATC CTCCAGCGGCA; NotI sense: 5 -GAGGATCGAGGAAGAGTTTCCGA AGAG; NotI antisense: 5 -ATAGCGGCCGCAAAAGGTGGGATTACA. The correct insertion of the P2X7-R578E/K579E cDNA into the expression vector was verified by a restriction digest analysis. The PCRgenerated portion of the P2X7-R578E/K579E cDNA was sequenced in both directions. HEK 293 cell transfection HEK 293 cells were transfected with the pIREShyg, pIRES/hP2X7, and the pIRES/hP2X7-R578E/K579E expression vectors using lipofectin reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD). HEK 293 cells that stably express the wild-type human P2X7 or the human P2X7-R578E/K579E mutant were plated at a density of 106 cells/well in 12-well dishes and grown at room temperature for 24 h before the experiment. H Fluorometric analysis of cytosolic Ca2 EK 293 cells stably expressing either the wild-type human P2X7 receptor or the human P2X7-R578E/K579E mutant receptor were plated at low density (106 cells/ml) on 100-mm dishes. Electrophysiological analysis of ATP-gated ion channels expressed in HEK 293 cells HEK 293 cells stably expressing either the wild-type human P2X7 or the human P2X7-R578E/K579E mutant were plated at low density (105 cells/ ml) on 35-mm dishes. Stable HEK 293 cell transfectants containing a human P2X7-R578E/K579E double point mutant exhibited normal levels of P2X7 mRNA and protein as assessed by RT-PCR and immunoblotting, relative to HEK cells expressing the wild-type P2X7 control (Fig. By contrast, the P2X7-R578E/K579E mutant cells exhibit a staining profile identical to the isotype control (Fig. This increase in surface P2X7 immunostaining at room temperature is more substantial with HEK cells transfected with P2X7R578E/K579E (1.2 0.1-fold at 37C vs 3.2 0.7-fold at room temperature; Fig. Consistent with these data are the observations that permeabilized HEK cells expressing the P2X7-R578E/K579E mutant exhibit P2X7 immunostaining at 37C that is not detected with intact cells (Fig. Collectively, these data regarding immunoreactivity with a conformational-specific Ab and the temperaturedependent restoration of mutant protein surface localization support the concept that the R578E/K579E mutation does not induce widespread deformation of P2X7 structure, but rather that the mutation affects proper receptor trafficking, membrane localization, and/or endocytosis. Expression profile and functional screening of HEK 293 cells stably transfected with the wild-type human P2X7 or the human P2X7R578E/K579E double-point mutant. By contrast, HEK cells transfected with the control vector or the P2X7-R578E/K579E mutant are resistant to Bz-ATP-induced death in this low-divalent cation killing assay, using agonist concentrations as high as 1 mM (Fig. Cell surface expression of human wild-type and mutant (R578E/K579E) P2X7 in transfected HEK cells cultured at reduced temperatures.

Channel and pore activity of the P2X7-R578E/K579E mutant To determine whether surface expression is sufficient for P2X7 agonist binding capacity and inducible ion channel activity, we performed patch clamping experiments evaluating inward sodium currents of ATP-treated HEK cells grown at room temperature (Fig. The P2X7-R578E/ K579E-transfected cells are also responsive to ATP with respect to inward sodium currents; however, these cells require higher concentrations of ATP to generate smaller sodium currents (Fig. Additionally, fewer of the P2X7-R578E/K579E-transfected cells are responsive at all (Fig. Taken together, the protein expression profiles in HEK cells of P2X7-S342F and P2X7-S342Y, which are mutations that are predicted to exhibit disturbances in receptor folding, are different from the pattern observed with the P2X7-R578E/K579E mutant. These data together with receptor reactivity of conformationally directed Abs suggest that the temperature-dependent surface immunoreactivity of the P2X7-R578E/ The Journal of Immunology 1309 FIGURE 5. HEK cells expressing either wild-type (A) or R578E/K579E mutant (B) human P2X7 were grown at room temperature for 18 h before patch clamping of single cells treated with increasing doses of ATP. C, Whole-cell inward sodium currents triggered by 3 mM ATP were recorded from 12 cells expressing wild-type P2X7 and 19 cells expressing the P2X7-R578E/K579E mutant. The peak inward current triggered by 3 mM ATP was normalized to cell surface area (membrane capacitance: 13.7 1.84 F in HEK/P2X7 cells vs 8.8 1.24 F in HEK/ P2X7-R578E/K579E cells) in 10 ATP-responsive cells in each case. Partial rescue of ATP-induced calcium current in HEK cells transfected with P2X7-R578E/K579E by removal of NaCl. HEK 293 cells that stably express the P2X7 wild-type (A and C) or the P2X7-R578E/ K579E mutant (B and D) receptors were cultured at room temperature for at least 18 h before treatment. However, depending upon the agonist, the P2X7-R578E/K579E mutant cells exhibited a variable effect of chloride removal on potassium efflux ( 0 or 25% for ATP and Bz-ATP, respectively). In sum, there is reduced potassium conductance of the channels formed by P2X7-R578E/K579E subunits. Thus, we evaluated the contribution of the dibasic amino acid motif to this P2X7 channel function by monitoring changes in fura 2-AM fluorescence in transfected HEK cells grown at room temperature, which is a condition that allows for cell surface expression of wild-type and mutant P2X7-R578E/K579E receptors (Fig. By contrast, ATP treatment causes a response only in HEK cells expressing wildtype P2X7, and does not promote a Ca2 flux in cells containing the P2X7-R578E/K579E mutant (Fig. HEK cells expressing either wildtype or R578E/K579E mutant human P2X7 were grown at room temperature for at least 18 h before trypsinization and resuspension in NaCl saline or sodium gluconate solutions at 106 cells/ml. HEK 293 cells that stably express human wild-type or R578E/K579E mutant receptors were cultured at room temperature for at least 18 h before treatment with 0 or 250 M Bz-ATP for 15 min at room temperature. A P2X7 retention domain might exist between residues 418 and 578, given that a 177-aa C-terminal truncation of the rat receptor allows for receptor expression on the surface, whereas the P2X7-R578E/ K579E mutant is not stabilized on the cell surface unless the growing temperature is reduced. We also observed that P2X7 channel activity is attenuated and that pore activity is completely abolished following mutation for Arg578/Lys579, despite the partial restoration of cell surface expression of P2X7-R578E/K579E at ambient growing temperatures. In sum, HEK cells expressing P2X7-R578E/K579E may be a useful tool to elucidate signaling events or other receptor activities, such as association with effector molecules or the cytoskeleton, that are independent of channel and pore formation. Interestingly, the potassium gluconate buffer system also causes a partial restoration of ATPinduced calcium flux in the P2X7-R578E/K579E mutant. Therefore, we evaluated the pore-forming capacity of the P2X7-R578E/K579E mutant cells to determine whether the channel and pore activities can be dissociated. By contrast, the P2X7-R578E/K579E mutant is unable to form pores at ambient temperatures, despite surface expression and partial channel activity (Fig. Because the P2X7R578E/K579E mutant is recognized by conformation-sensitive Abs, and because its cell surface expression is detectable at 24 27C, it is likely that this mutation does not promote large-scale receptor deformation, misfolding, or improper membrane insertion. The P2X7-S342F, S342Y, and S342A mutants were created by a similar strategy using different primers. One such mutant is P2X7-S342F, which we FIGURE 1. A, Immunoblotting of cell lysates from RAW 264.7 cells or HEK cells transfected with either wild-type or mutant (S342F, S342A, S342Y) P2X7 using a polyclonal Ab that recognizes an epitope within the C-terminal domain of P2X7. In this regard, the bulky point mutants (S342F and S342Y) are not expressed on the surface and have reduced levels of total protein expression (Fig. Preliminary data suggest that the S342A mutant is functional (29.7-fold stimulation of Bz-ATP-induced YO-PRO-1 uptake vs 1.0- and 1.0-fold for the S342F and S342Y mutants, respectively), and that growth at room temperature is not sufficient to substantially restore the pore activities of the S342F and S342Y mutants (2.3- and 0.9-fold, respectively). Taken together, the protein expression profiles in HEK cells of P2X7-S342F and P2X7-S342Y, which are mutations that are predicted to exhibit disturbances in receptor folding, are different from the pattern observed with the P2X7-R578E/K579E mutant. Additionally, two P2X7 mutants with bulky amino acid substitutions within the second transmembrane domain (S342F and S342Y, but not S342A) have reduced protein expression (Fig. In contrast with the wild-type receptor, the P2X7-R578E/K579E mutant fails to demonstrate surface immunoreactivity despite normal levels of total protein expression. Despite surface expression at reduced temperatures, at 25C the P2X7-R578E/K579E mutant still exhibits greatly reduced sodium, potassium, and calcium channel activity when compared with the wild-type receptor, and cannot induce pore formation. Construction of the human P2X7-R578E/K579E mutant Two point mutations in the P2X7 cDNA that are necessary for the desired 2 aa change were introduced by PCR using the following primers (Operon Technologies, Alameda, CA): BsrGI sense: 5 -AATTTGACATTATCCA GCTGGTGGTGTACA; BsrGI antisense: 5 -GAAACTCTTCCTCGATC CTCCAGCGGCA; NotI sense: 5 -GAGGATCGAGGAAGAGTTTCCGA AGAG; NotI antisense: 5 -ATAGCGGCCGCAAAAGGTGGGATTACA. The correct insertion of the P2X7-R578E/K579E cDNA into the expression vector was verified by a restriction digest analysis. The PCRgenerated portion of the P2X7-R578E/K579E cDNA was sequenced in both directions. HEK 293 cell transfection HEK 293 cells were transfected with the pIREShyg, pIRES/hP2X7, and the pIRES/hP2X7-R578E/K579E expression vectors using lipofectin reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD). HEK 293 cells that stably express the wild-type human P2X7 or the human P2X7-R578E/K579E mutant were plated at a density of 106 cells/well in 12-well dishes and grown at room temperature for 24 h before the experiment. H Fluorometric analysis of cytosolic Ca2 EK 293 cells stably expressing either the wild-type human P2X7 receptor or the human P2X7-R578E/K579E mutant receptor were plated at low density (106 cells/ml) on 100-mm dishes. Electrophysiological analysis of ATP-gated ion channels expressed in HEK 293 cells HEK 293 cells stably expressing either the wild-type human P2X7 or the human P2X7-R578E/K579E mutant were plated at low density (105 cells/ ml) on 35-mm dishes. Stable HEK 293 cell transfectants containing a human P2X7-R578E/K579E double point mutant exhibited normal levels of P2X7 mRNA and protein as assessed by RT-PCR and immunoblotting, relative to HEK cells expressing the wild-type P2X7 control (Fig. By contrast, the P2X7-R578E/K579E mutant cells exhibit a staining profile identical to the isotype control (Fig. This increase in surface P2X7 immunostaining at room temperature is more substantial with HEK cells transfected with P2X7R578E/K579E (1.2 0.1-fold at 37C vs 3.2 0.7-fold at room temperature; Fig. Consistent with these data are the observations that permeabilized HEK cells expressing the P2X7-R578E/K579E mutant exhibit P2X7 immunostaining at 37C that is not detected with intact cells (Fig. Collectively, these data regarding immunoreactivity with a conformational-specific Ab and the temperaturedependent restoration of mutant protein surface localization support the concept that the R578E/K579E mutation does not induce widespread deformation of P2X7 structure, but rather that the mutation affects proper receptor trafficking, membrane localization, and/or endocytosis. Expression profile and functional screening of HEK 293 cells stably transfected with the wild-type human P2X7 or the human P2X7R578E/K579E double-point mutant. By contrast, HEK cells transfected with the control vector or the P2X7-R578E/K579E mutant are resistant to Bz-ATP-induced death in this low-divalent cation killing assay, using agonist concentrations as high as 1 mM (Fig. Cell surface expression of human wild-type and mutant (R578E/K579E) P2X7 in transfected HEK cells cultured at reduced temperatures.

K579E mutant is caused by alterations in receptor trafficking events, and not simply a factor of receptor misfolding or defective membrane insertion. Channel and pore activity of the P2X7-R578E/K579E mutant To determine whether surface expression is sufficient for P2X7 agonist binding capacity and inducible ion channel activity, we performed patch clamping experiments evaluating inward sodium currents of ATP-treated HEK cells grown at room temperature (Fig. The P2X7-R578E/ K579E-transfected cells are also responsive to ATP with respect to inward sodium currents; however, these cells require higher concentrations of ATP to generate smaller sodium currents (Fig. Additionally, fewer of the P2X7-R578E/K579E-transfected cells are responsive at all (Fig. Taken together, the protein expression profiles in HEK cells of P2X7-S342F and P2X7-S342Y, which are mutations that are predicted to exhibit disturbances in receptor folding, are different from the pattern observed with the P2X7-R578E/K579E mutant. HEK cells expressing either wild-type (A) or R578E/K579E mutant (B) human P2X7 were grown at room temperature for 18 h before patch clamping of single cells treated with increasing doses of ATP. C, Whole-cell inward sodium currents triggered by 3 mM ATP were recorded from 12 cells expressing wild-type P2X7 and 19 cells expressing the P2X7-R578E/K579E mutant. The peak inward current triggered by 3 mM ATP was normalized to cell surface area (membrane capacitance: 13.7 1.84 F in HEK/P2X7 cells vs 8.8 1.24 F in HEK/ P2X7-R578E/K579E cells) in 10 ATP-responsive cells in each case.

Because mutations introducing bulky residues in transmembrane domains have been shown to influence protein folding of other receptor systems (33), we also created the tyrosine and alanine mutants, P2X7-S342Y and P2X7-S342A. In this regard, the bulky point mutants (S342F and S342Y) are not expressed on the surface and have reduced levels of total protein expression (Fig. Preliminary data suggest that the S342A mutant is functional (29.7-fold stimulation of Bz-ATP-induced YO-PRO-1 uptake vs 1.0- and 1.0-fold for the S342F and S342Y mutants, respectively), and that growth at room temperature is not sufficient to substantially restore the pore activities of the S342F and S342Y mutants (2.3- and 0.9-fold, respectively).

9727001	When heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cells, current amplitudes from mutant Kir1.1a[N124K] channels were reduced by a factor of 12 as compared with wild type. Coexpression experiments revealed a dominant-negative effect of Kir1.1a[N124K] and gpKir1.3 on macroscopic current amplitudes when coexpressed with wild type Kir1.1a and gpKir[K110N], respectively. The HPS phenotype in man can be explained by the lower expression of functional channels by the Kir1.1a[N124K] mutant. In the present report, we describe the clinical and functional analysis of a novel HPS mutation, N124K,3 that affects an extracellularly localized residue of Kir1.1. Therefore, two mutagenic primers (Kir1.1a[N124K], 5 -TGTGTGGAGAAAATTAATGGC-3 ; gpKir1.3[K110N], 5 -TGCATCATGAATGTGGACTCT-3 ), and one selection primer (5 -CAAGCTTACGTAGGCCTGCATGCGACGT3 ) were employed (base changes are underlined). RESULTS Case Report and Mutational Analysis in KCNJ1--Replacement of an asparagine by a lysine at position 124 (N124K) in Kir1.1a (KCNJ1) was found in a heterozygous state in a sporadic case of hyperprostaglandin E syndrome (HPS). The child developed hypokalemic alkalosis, hyposthenuria, and 23886 Extracellular Lysine Residues in Kir1.1 and Kir1.3 Channels possible effects in heterozygous individuals, oocytes were injected with equal cRNA amounts of Kir1.1a and Kir1.1a[N124K] (total amount equal to that used before). This indicated a dominant-negative effect of the mutant Kir1.1a[N124K] subunits, and in heterozygous individuals, renders a total rescue of channel function by a simple heteromerization of WT and mutant subunits quite unlikely (see "Discussion"). We noticed that in contrast to any other known Kir subunit, both hKir1.3 and gpKir1.3 carried the equivalent of the Kir1.1a[N124K] mutation, a positively charged lysine residue at position 110 (Lys-110) in the less conserved extracellular M1-H5 linker. Quantitative analysis of Kir1.1a/Kir1.1a[N124K] (A) and gpKir1.3/Kir1.3[K110N] (B) channels in Xenopus oocytes. Direct sequencing demonstrated (i) a heterozygous base exchange of a thymine 232 adenine at base position 372 resulting in a missense mutation (N124K) and (ii) the insertion of an additional cytosine at base position 105558, causing a frameshift mutation with an altered C-terminal amino acid sequence (starting at His-354) and a premature stop codon at amino acid position 362 in the mutated protein. Cosegregation analysis identified N124K as the maternal, and the frameshift, as the paternal allele. Heterologous Expression of Wild Type Kir1.1a and Mutant Kir1.1a[N124K] Channels--To investigate the functional consequences of the novel HPS mutation N124K, WT, and mutant Kir1.1a channels were heterologously expressed in both Xenopus oocytes and mammalian COS-7 cells. When mutant Kir1.1a[N124K] channels were expressed in oocytes, the kinetics of the macroscopic current were indistinguishable from WT Kir1.1a, but amplitudes were dramatically reduced to 8% (3.9 1.2 A; n 5) under the same recording conditions (Fig. Expression of Kir1.1a[N124K] in COS-7 cells resulted in a similar reduction in amplitude as compared with WT Kir1.1a (135 24 pA, n 3 versus 1.12 1.1 nA, n 33). The equivalent analysis performed for WT and mutant Kir1.1a channels under our recording conditions yielded identical values for both the unitary 34 pS; n 4) and open channel probability (po conductance ( 0.68 014 for Kir1.1a and po 0.66 0.11 for Kir1.1a[N124K]). In comparison, current amplitudes were reduced by more than half when mutant Kir1.3[K110N] subunits were coinjected with the HPS mutant Kir1.1[N124K]. Taken together, these data implied that (i) WT and/or mutant Kir1.1/Kir1.3 channels were likely to interact in the formation of heteromeric Kir channels with specific properties, that (ii) heteromeric Kir1.3[K110N]/ Kir1.1 channels in which lysines are absent yield largest current flux, and (iii) that the impaired function of mutant Kir1.1[N124K] channels remained unrescued by coexpressed Kir1.3 subunits. C, ramp currents in 96 mM ([K ]e demonstrate the difference in rectification between WT/mutant Kir1.3[K110N] channels and WT/mutant Kir1.1a[N124K] channels expressed in oocytes. In contrast, Kir1.1a and mutant Kir1.1a[N124K] were blocked by 1 mM Ba2 with a unique rapid on and off rate 124 74 ms; OFF 230 71 ms; n 6). Interestingly, replacement of the negatively charged residue in Kir1.3 and Kir1.1a[N124K] channels had the opposite effect on Ba2 affinity in Kir1.3 as compared with Kir1.1 channels. 4A), introducing a lysine in the HPS Kir1.1a[N124K] channels lowered the Ba2 sensitivity (Ki 282 M) by a factor of 3 (Fig. The HPS mutation described here, Kir1.1a[N124K], replaces an uncharged for a charged extracellular residue in the linker region between the M1 transmembrane segment and the pore region and has attracted our interest for two reasons. Data from WT gpKir1.3 (q) and mutant Kir1.3[K110N] (E) (A) as well as WT Kir1.1a (E) and mutant Kir1.1a[N124K] (q) (B) expressed in oocytes are shown for comparison. Curves are least squares fits of data points to a Michaelis-Menten equation (1/1 [A/Ki]n revealing Ki Ba2 of 16.8 M (gpKir1.3), 25.1 M (gpKir1.3[K110N]), 84.8 M (Kir1.1a), and 282 M (Kir1.1a[N124K]; A and n are variables. Since initial attempts failed to elicit currents from individually expressed hKir1.3 subunits (13), we suspected a similar mechanism to underlie the loss of function HPS mutation Kir1.1a[N124K]. Indeed Kir1.1a[N124K] currents were strongly decreased and Ba2 sensitivity lowered 3-fold compared with WT channels. With both single channel conductance and open channel probability of Kir1.1a[N124K] and gpKir1.3 WT channels virtually unchanged by the mutation, the underlying molecular mechanism for this impaired function was found to be primarily due to altered expression of functional channels. In contrast, as reflected by the fast Ba2 unblocking kinetics in Kir1.1a[N124K] mutant channels, the negatively charged lysine substantially lowered the sensitivity to Ba2 .. We found a dominant-negative effect of the extracellular lysine residue on composite currents when a subunit with lysine (Kir1.1a[N124K] or gpKir1.3) was coexpressed with a subunit with an asparagine at the respective position (Kir1.1a, Kir1.3[K110N]). (ii) The dominantnegative effect of Kir1.1a[N124K] in the presence of WT Kir1.1a might be exaggerated in vitro as compared with in vivo conditions. Rescue of channel function of heterozygous Kir1.1a[N124K] by Kir1.3 is unlikely since coexpression of these two subunits also yielded low current amplitudes. Coexpression experiments revealed a dominant-negative effect of Kir1.1a[N124K] and gpKir1.3 on macroscopic current amplitudes when coexpressed with wild type Kir1.1a and gpKir[K110N], respectively. Therefore, two mutagenic primers (Kir1.1a[N124K], 5 -TGTGTGGAGAAAATTAATGGC-3 ; gpKir1.3[K110N], 5 -TGCATCATGAATGTGGACTCT-3 ), and one selection primer (5 -CAAGCTTACGTAGGCCTGCATGCGACGT3 ) were employed (base changes are underlined). Heterologous Expression of gpKir1.3 and gpKir1.3[K110N]-- Macroscopic current evaluation of expressed WT and mutant Kir1.3[K110N] channels revealed that this lysine residue in fact was crucially important for the integrity of Kir1.3 channel function. Moreover, exchange of the HPS lysine for an asparagine (K110N), as in WT Kir1.1a channels, potentiated macroscopic currents to an average 27 6.7 FIG. Quantitative analysis of Kir1.1a/Kir1.1a[N124K] (A) and gpKir1.3/Kir1.3[K110N] (B) channels in Xenopus oocytes. Robust whole-cell currents were also obtained after transfection of COS-7 cells with mutant Kir1.3[K110N] cDNA (968 405 pA, n 12), but only minor currents (100 150 pA) were observed in few cells transfected with WT Kir1.3. As shown from ramp and voltage-jump responses in varying concentrations of [K ]o, both WT and mutant Kir1.3[K110N] channels were highly selective for K ions with large amplitudes negative to the K Nernst potential EK. Measured in COS-7 cells with a fast microperfusion assay, Kir1.3 and Kir1.3[K110N] channels demonstrated the characteristically 6low unbinding of Ba2 from the pore ( OFF 4.96 0.7 s; n s ), which is typical of all Kir2 channels (Refs. Kir1.3[K110N] channels (po as a measure of average current flux Thus the product po through single channels was virtually identical between WT and mutant Kir1.3 channels. The ratio of macroscopic currents, however, was 1:6, suggesting that current potentiation in Kir1.3[K110N] channels was mainly due to elevated expression of functional channels (Fig. When slow OFF rate and high Ba2 affinity (Ki mutant Kir1.3[K110N] and Kir1.1 subunits were coinjected (Fig. In comparison, current amplitudes were reduced by more than half when mutant Kir1.3[K110N] subunits were coinjected with the HPS mutant Kir1.1[N124K]. Taken together, these data implied that (i) WT and/or mutant Kir1.1/Kir1.3 channels were likely to interact in the formation of heteromeric Kir channels with specific properties, that (ii) heteromeric Kir1.3[K110N]/ Kir1.1 channels in which lysines are absent yield largest current flux, and (iii) that the impaired function of mutant Kir1.1[N124K] channels remained unrescued by coexpressed Kir1.3 subunits. C, ramp currents in 96 mM ([K ]e demonstrate the difference in rectification between WT/mutant Kir1.3[K110N] channels and WT/mutant Kir1.1a[N124K] channels expressed in oocytes. Whereas WT t Kir1.3 channels showed a slightly higher sensitivity to Ba2 han the mutant Kir1.3[K110N] (Ki 25.1 M; Fig. was found in Kir1.3[K110N] channels ( Patients suffering from HPS are characterized by an impaired renal salt reabsorption.

Note the different time course of the unblocking reaction of Ba2 , which is slow for gpKir1.3[K110N] ( ON 4.96) and fast for Kir1.1a ( OFF 183 ms). Data from WT gpKir1.3 (q) and mutant Kir1.3[K110N] (E) (A) as well as WT Kir1.1a (E) and mutant Kir1.1a[N124K] (q) (B) expressed in oocytes are shown for comparison.

By analogy, the reverse HPS mutation K110N introduced in gpKir1.3 gave rise to a strong macroscopic current amplitude 6-fold larger than for WT gpKir1.3 channels.

We found a dominant-negative effect of the extracellular lysine residue on composite currents when a subunit with lysine (Kir1.1a[N124K] or gpKir1.3) was coexpressed with a subunit with an asparagine at the respective position (Kir1.1a, Kir1.3[K110N]). 
15148291	To address the possibility of an unsuspected population bias,30 a further control gene, multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1), with intermediate allelic frequencies of the C3435T SNP in exon 26 was used,28,31 which was not linked to ClCNKB. Genotyping for C3435T was performed by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography analysis as previously described.32 drome,17,18 characterized by mild salt wasting, whereas a combined loss-of-function of ClC-Ka and ClC-Kb by mutations of the barttin gene BSND or digenic mutations in CLCNKA and CLCNKB cause severe renal salt wasting with antenatal onset, congenital deafness, and renal failure.20,22 Most recently, voltage clamp experiments disclosed that a naturally occurring variation of the CLCNKB gene (1441 A T; Acc. To determine whether individuals with normal or elevated blood pressure might be covertly stratified, we analyzed the unlinked frequent genetic polymorphism C3435T of the MDR1 gene. For the total population, the frequency distribution of wild-type (CC), heterozygous (CT), and homozygous mutant (TT) individuals were 26%, 50%, and 24%, respectively, which are completely in line with the prevalence of this mutation in several large healthy German populations p r e v i o u s l y i n v e s t i g a t e d .3 1 A v e r a g e s y s t o l i c a n d d i a s t o l i c b l o o d p r e s s u r e s w e r e s i m i l a r i n C C 3 4 3 5 ( 1 2 9 12/ 80 9 mm Hg), C3435T (130 17/79 10 mm Hg), and 3435TT (132 18/80 11 mm Hg) carriers. There were no significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for the C3435T polymorphism within heterozygous and homozygous mutant individuals of ClC-KbT481S and ClC-Kb wildtype subjects. Recently, we identified the ClC-KbT481S polymorphism, which confers a strong gain-of-function effect on the ClC-Kb chloride channel. As evident from electrophysiological analysis with the 2-electrode voltage-clamp technique, heterologous expression of ClC-KbT481S in Xenopus oocytes gave rise to a current that was 7-fold larger than the current produced by wild-type ClC-Kb. As tested in 1 white population, carriers of ClC-KbT481S were associated with significantly higher systolic (by 6.0 mm Hg) and diastolic (by 4.2 mm Hg) blood pressures and significantly higher prevalence (45% versus 25%) of hypertensive ( 140/90 mm Hg) blood pressure levels. Individuals carrying ClC-KbT481S had significantly higher plasma Na concentrations and c significantly decreased glomerular filtration rate. In conclusion, the mutation ClC-KbT481S of the renal epithelial Cl hannel ClC-Kb strongly activates ClC-Kb chloride channel function in vitro and may predispose to the development of essential hypertension in vivo. NM 000085.1), leading to the replacement of threonine by serine at the amino acid position 481 of the ClC-Kb protein (ClC-KbT481S), dramatically increases ClC-Kb chloride channel activity.25 In theory, enhanced activity of ClC-Kb should decrease cytosolic Cl concentration, which, in turn, would enhance the driving force and transport rate of the luminal Na , K , 2Cl cotransport, eventually stimulating transepithelial NaCl reabsorption. To the extent that enhanced reabsorption of Na in the TAL would lead to renal salt retention, carriers of the ClC-KbT481S mutation should be prone to increased blood pressure. Methods Functional Analysis of Mutated ClC-Kb To verify the functional significance of the ClC-KbT481S mutation, Xenopus laevis oocytes were injected26 with cRNA-encoding wild-type barttin (5 ng/oocyte) together with 5 ng/oocyte of either wild-type ClC-Kb11 or ClC-KbT481S.25 After 3 days, the currents were determined in 2-electrode voltage-clamp experiments with a pulse protocol of 800 ms pulses from 140 mV to 40 mV in 20-mV increments from 60 mV. Frequency distribution of the ClC-KbT481S mutation was further investigated in 3 additional groups recruited randomly from: (1) healthy blood donors in the Department of Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital of Tuebingen; (2) general population of Southern Bavaria; (3) hospital staff and medical students of the Ghana Medical School in Accra, mainly of the Ga tribe.27,28 The study was approved by the respective local ethics committees in Munich and Tubingen and the University Accra, Ghana. Fluorescence signals were determined with ABI PRISM 7700 detection system Results As shown in the Figure, in the presence of barttin, the current induced by ClC-KbT481S was significantly larger than the current induced by wild-type ClC-Kb. The prevalence of the ClC-KbT481S mutation is given in Table 1. In 3 different white populations, a prevalence of 20% for heterozygous ClC-KbT481S/ClC-Kb and of 2% of homozygous mutant individuals (ClC-KbT481S/ClC-KbT481S) were obtained. Allele and genotype frequencies were significantly different between the white and the Ghana population Jeck et al ClC-Kb and Blood Pressure 1177 Enhanced conductance of ClC-KbT481S as compared with wildtype ClC-Kb. Xenopus oocytes have been injected with mRNA encoding barttin and either ClC-Kb or ClC-KbT481S. B, Arithmetic means SEM (n number of experiments) of currents in Xenopus oocytes expressing wild-type (wt) ClC-Kb/barttin or ClC-KbT481S/barttin. *Significant difference between currents in oocytes expressing wt ClC-Kb or ClC-KbT481S. The prevalence of carriers of ClC-KbT481S was significantly higher in Africans as compared with any of the 3 white populations (Table 1). dents and employees) from the University of Tubingen did not show significant differences in age, gender, size, body weight, and body surface area between carriers of ClC-KbT481S (ClC-KbT481S/ClC-Kb and ClC-KbT481S/ClC-KbT481S) and "wild-type" individuals (ClC-Kb/ClC-Kb) (Table 2). In contrast, systolic and diastolic blood pressure values were significantly higher in carriers of ClC-KbT481S than in carriers of ClC-Kb/ClC-Kb. A similar significant difference of blood pressure values was obtained at comparison of heterozygous ClC-KbT481S/ClC-Kb with ClC-Kb/ClC-Kb. Three of the 6 individuals carrying ClC-KbT481S/ClC-KbT481S had hypertensive blood pressure values ( 140/90 mm Hg). Because of the small sample size, the mean values from single blood pressure determinations were not significantly different between ClC-KbT481S/ClC-KbT481S and ClC-Kb/ClC-Kb. As indicated in Table 2, the difference of blood pressure between carriers of ClC-KbT481S and ClC-Kb/ClC-Kb wildtype individuals still holds true after correction for age. Male carriers of ClC-KbT481S had again significantly higher blood pressure values than male ClC-Kb/ClC-Kb carriers. Female carriers of ClC-KbT481S tended to have higher blood pressure values than female ClC-Kb/ClC-Kb carriers; however, the difference was not statistically significant. After exclusion of blood pressure data from individuals undergoing antihypertensive treatment (n 18), the systolic (P 0.022) and diastolic (P 0.015) blood pressure values were still significantly higher in carriers of ClC-KbT481S than in ClC-Kb/ClC-Kb. The incidence of hypertensive blood pressure values ( 140/90 mm Hg) was significantly (P 0.01) higher in carriers of ClC-KbT481S than in ClC-Kb/ClC-Kb (odds ratio 2.4). A similar significantly enhanced incidence of hypertensive blood pressure values was observed in male (P 0.017; odds ratio 3.7) but not in female carriers of ClC-KbT481S.

There were no significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for the C3435T polymorphism within heterozygous and homozygous mutant individuals of ClC-KbT481S and ClC-Kb wildtype subjects. Individuals carrying ClC-KbT481S had a significantly (P 0.019) higher plasma Na concentration and a significantly (P 0.05) smaller GFR than ClC-Kb/ClC-Kb. The fractional excretion of K was significantly (P 0.046) larger, whereas those of Na , Ca2 , and phosphate were not significantly different in carriers of ClC-KbT481S as compared with ClC-Kb/ClC-Kb. After this correction, the systolic (P 0.001) and diastolic (P 0.004) blood pressure values were still significantly higher in carriers of ClC-KbT481S than in carriers of ClC-Kb/ClC-Kb. Discussion The present observations confirm the gain of function of ClC-KbT481S shown previously.25 More importantly, they disclose the significance of enhanced activity of ClC-Kb channels for hypertension. Even heterozygous individuals display significantly higher blood pressure, indicating that the parallel expression of ClC-KbT481S and wild-type ClC-Kb favors renal salt retention and subsequent increase of blood pressure. In theory, an increased prevalence of the ClC-KbT481S mutation in this population may by chance be associated with another genetic alteration predisposing to hypertension.

P for differences between ClC-Kb/ClC-Kb and carriers of ClC-KbT481S. As a result, the MDR1 gene polymorphism was not associated with increased blood pressure and, as expected, did not correlate with ClC-KbT481S. Because ClC-Kb is expressed exclusively in the kidney and the inner ear,10,11 the increase of blood pressure in individuals carrying the ClC-KbT481S mutation must be the result of altered renal NaCl reabsorption. In contrast, the ClC-KbT481S mutation is frequent and may well substantially contribute to the development of essential hypertension. The impact of ClC-KbT481S is apparently modest and the mutation does not invariably lead to hypertension. In a second approach, fluorescence resonance energy transfer with Light Cycler (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) was used for genotyping.29 For the ClC-KbT418S (A/T) polymorphism, the following conditions were applied: forward primer: 5 -CTG CCT GAC TCT GCC CTT GCA G-3 ; reverse primer: 5 -CAG TCA GCC TGA GGT GGG CAC-3 ; donor hybridization probe: 5 -GTG ACC CAC ACC ATC TCC AC-fluorescein-3 ; acceptor hybridization probe: 5 -LCRed640-GCT GCT GGC CTT CGA GGT GAC CGG CCA GAT-3 .

First, using electrophysiological recordings from mammalian cell lines, coexpressing sodium channel subunits and either wild-type 1 or C121W 1, we show that loss of 1 functional modulation, caused by the C121W mutation, leads to increased sodium channel availability at hyperpolarized membrane potentials and reduced sodium channel rundown during high-frequency channel activity, compared with channels coexpressed with wildtype 1. In contrast, neither wild-type 1 nor C121W 1 signifIdiopathic epilepsies are w idely believed to involve poly morphi sms in multiple susceptibilit y genes (Steinlein, 2001). We also show, using a Drosophila S2 cell adhesion assay, that the C121W mutation disrupts 1 1 homophilic cell adhesion, suggesting that the mutation may alter the ability of 1 to mediate proteinprotein interactions critical for sodium channel localization. Finally, we demonstrate that neither functional modulation nor cell adhesion mediated by wild-type 1 is occluded by coexpression of C121W 1, arguing against the idea that the mutant 1 acts as a dominant-negative subunit. Together, these data suggest that C121W 1 causes subtle effects on channel function and subcellular distribution that bias neurons toward hyperexcitabity and epileptogenesis. Somewhat surpri singly, the first identified GEFS mutation (GEFS plus 1) was in the 1 gene SCN1B, resulting in substitution of tr y ptophan for a critical c ysteine residue (mutant C121W) in the Ig domain of the 1 subunit (Wallace et al., 1998). In contrast, the C121W mutation results in loss of thi s f unctional modulation (Wallace et al., 1998). T hus, Xenopus ooc y tes may not be well suited for understanding either the effects of 1 or the pathophysiological consequences of C121W 1. T hese considerations prompted us to reassess the C121W mutation using electrophysiological and biochemical approaches. In thi s study, we report several novel findings that may be relevant for understanding how C121W 1 causes epilepsy. T he C121W mutation (to avoid conf usion, we have chosen to use the C121W nomenclature, although the or igi nal number i ng desig nates thi s residue as C102) (Isom et al., 1992) was i ntroduc ed i nto cDNA s for rat 1 (i n vector pCR2.1) and human 1 (i n vector pCI H1) usi ng standard PCR mutagenesi s (Barek, 1993) w ith either P wo (Roche Diag nostics, L aval, Quebec) or A mpliTaq (Perk i nEl mer, Boston, M A) DNA pol y merase. 2 a , w i l d - t y p e 1, and C121W 1 (all in vector pSP64T) using the Message Machine RNA sy nthesi s k it (A mbion, Austi n, T X).

RESULTS C121W disrupts functional modulation of sodium channels by 1 in oocy tes T he first step in our analysi s was to confirm the effects described prev iously of 1 and C121W 1 subunits on cloned sodium channels ex pressed in Xenopus ooc y tes (Isom et al., 1992; Wallace et al., 1998). Figure 1 shows the effects of rat w ild-t y pe 1 or C121W 1 subunits on the time course of whole-cell sodium currents in ooc y tes ex pressing the rat Nav1.2a subt y pe of the sodium channel subunit. In contrast, injection of a 10-foldhigher concentration of C121W 1 RNA did not cause detectable modulation of current time course (Fig. Interestingly, however, the C121W mutation did not completely aboli sh 1 f unction. C121W 1 does not affect the time course of sodium currents in mammalian cells T he data from ooc y tes suggest that the C121W mutation results in a dramatic reduction in 1 f unction, but how does thi s cause epilepsy? A s di scussed above, Xenopus ooc y tes may di stort sodium channel f unction and thus may not be the best cell system for addressing thi s question. For these reasons, we examined the effects of ex pression of 1 and C121W 1 subunits on rat Nav1.2a and human Nav1.3 sodium channels stably ex pressed in cultured mammalian cells. Wild-t y pe 1 and C121W 1 associate w ith human Nav1.3 s ubunits in C NahIII-12 cells.

C oimmunoprecipitation data demonstrated that C121W 1, like w ild-t y pe 1, was ex pressed in transfected C NahIII-12 cells and associated w ith the hNav1.3 subunit (Fig. Figure 3, A and B, shows mean normali z ed sodium currents elicited by depolari z ation to 0 mV in C NahIII-12 cells ex pressing hNav1.3 alone, hNav1.3 plus 1, or hNav1.3 plus C121W 1. Second, neither 1 nor C121W 1 significantly altered the inacti vation time course or the level of persi stent current. T he addition of the aux iliar y 2 subunit did not a ffect the current time course or other channel properties, when expressed w ith hNav1.3 alone, w ith w ild-t y pe 1, or w ith C121W 1 (Meadows et al., 2002) (data not show n). Neither w ild-t y pe 1 nor C121W 1 a ffect sodium current time course in C NahIII-12 cells. A, Mean time course of currents evoked at 0 mV in cells stably ex pressing hNav1.3 alone (solid line, n 5), hNav1.3 plus 1 (dashed line, n 6), or hNav1.3 plus C121W 1 (dotted line, n 7). T he g raph shows fast ( filled s ymbols) and slow (open s ymbols) time constants for hNav1.3 alone (squares), hNav1.3 plus 1 (diamonds), and hNav1.3 plus C121W 1 (triangles), determined over a range of test potentials. C121W 1 increases sodium channel availability What other changes in channel f unction might be responsible for causing the GEFS phenotype? One possibilit y i s that channels coex pressed w ith C121W 1 subunits open or inacti vate over a different voltage range than channels coex pressed w ith w ild-t y pe 1 subunits. For example, if channels associated w ith C121W 1 acti vate at more negati ve voltages, thi s would increase cell excitabilit y by lowering the action potential threshold. We investigated whether 1 and C121W 1 had differing effects on sodium channel acti vation in C NahIII-12 cells by apply ing test pulses to a range of test potentials and converting the resulting currentvoltage relationships to acti vation cur ves (see Materials and Methods). Neither 1 nor C121W 1 significantly altered the voltage dependence of channel acti vation (Fig. T hese data suggest that C121W 1 does not cause sei z ures by altering the voltage range over which sodium channels open. In contrast, C121W 1 did not cause thi s negati ve shift in channel availabilit y (Fig. T he more positi ve availabilit y cur ve for sodium channels coex pressed w ith C121W 1 compared w ith channels coex pressed w ith w ild-t y pe 1 could increase cell excitabilit y by increasing the fraction of sodium channels available Meadows et al.

Sodium currents in C NahIII-12 cells ex pressing C121W 1 show reduced frequenc y-dependent rundow n and faster recover y from inacti vation, compared w ith currents in cells ex pressing w ild-t y pe 1. A, Mean amplitudes of currents elicited by 80 H z pulse trains in C NahIII-12 cells ex pressing hNav1.3 alone ( , n 5) and for cells stably coex pressing w ild-t y pe 1 ( , n 5) or C121W 1 (,, n 6). T he smooth lines are means of ex ponential fits of the data, w ith time constants of 3.7 0.5, 4.9 0.5, and 10.5 0.3 msec, for hNav1.3 alone, hNav1.3 plus C121W 1, and hNav 1.3 plus 1, respecti vely. Both rundow n and recover y time course were significantly different in cells coex pressing 1 than in cells ex pressing hNav1.3 alone or w ith C121W 1 ( p 0.0001). C121W reduces frequency-dependent rundown of sodium channels Whole-cell sodium currents run dow n during high-frequenc y channel acti v it y, reflecting incomplete channel repriming bet ween epi sodes of channel acti vation. To examine whether the epileptogenic properties of C121W 1 could be caused at least in part by effects on frequenc y-dependent sodium channel rundow n, we examined whole-cell sodium currents over the course of rapid pulse trains. In contrast, in C NahIII-12 cells ex pressing hNav1.3 alone or hNav1.3 plus C121W 1, the currents declined by only 20 30% (Fig. Recover y time constants were 4, 5, and 11 msec in cells ex pressing hNav1.3 alone, hNav1.3 plus C121W 1, and hNav1.3 plus w ild-t y pe 1, respecti vely (Fig. 5B, dashed line) for cells ex pressing hNav1.3 alone, hNav1.3 plus C121W 1, or hNav1.3 plus w ild-t y pe 1, respecti vely, which are values that match ver y closely to the obser ved frequenc y-dependent rundow n for these different cell t y pes.

C121W 1 does not act as a dominant-negative subunit for modulation of channel function L oss-of-f unction mutations are frequently associated w ith recessi ve phenot y pes, yet GEFS plus 1 shows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern (Wallace et al., 1998). For example, C121W 1 could act as a dominant-negati ve subunit by binding to the sodium channel subunit and occluding association of the f unctional w ild-t y pe 1. We tested thi s hy pothesi s by coex pressing both w ild-t y pe 1 and C121W 1 in the same C NahIII-12 cells and then examining the f unctional properties of the ex pressed sodium channels using whole-cell recording. If C121W 1 acted as a dominant negati ve, then we would ex pect ex pression of the mutant 1 subunit to at least partially occlude f unctional modulation by the w ild-t y pe 1 subunit; however, thi s was not the case. C an the differences in f unctional modulation of Nav1.3 channels by w ild-t y pe 1 and C121W 1 in mammalian cells be generali z ed to other channel subt y pes? To begin to address thi s question, we examined rat brain Nav1.2a sodium channels stably ex pressed in SNaII A cells, a C hinese hamster lung-deri ved cell line (Isom et al., 1995b). To examine the effects of w ild-t y pe and mutant 1 subunits on rat Nav1.2a channels, we made SNaII Aderi ved cell lines stably coex pressing either rat 1 or C121W 1 under the control of an ecdysone-inducible promoter. Figure 7A shows Western blots demonstrating that 1 or C121W 1 subunit protein ex pression was induced in SNaII A-pI N D. 1C121W cells, respecti vely, a fter 48 hr of treatment w ith 20 M ponasterone ( ), whereas there was no 1 subunit ex pression a fter treatment w ith vehicle alone ( ). 7B) showed that both w ild-t y pe 1 and C121W 1 subunits associated efficiently w ith rat Nav1.2a subunits in SNaII A cells. T hese results are consi stent w ith coimmunoprecipitation data in Figure 2, prov iding additional ev idence that the C121W mutation does not prevent - 1 dimeri z ation in mammalian cells. T he effects of w ild-t y pe 1 and C121W 1 on the properties of rat Nav1.2a channels in SNaII A cells are summari z ed in Figure 8. In contrast, induction of C121W 1 did not have thi s effect. T hese data are qualitati vely similar to data obtained using C NahIII-12 cells and thus are consi stent w ith the hy pothesi s that loss of 1-mediated f unctional modulation in mammalian cells by the C121W mutation can be generali z ed to different brain subtypes. C121W causes loss of 1 functional modulation of rat Nav1.2a sodium channels Brain neurons ex press at least five different subtypes (Goldin et cells resulted in a t wofold to four fold increase in the level of plasma membrane binding sites for the sodium channel-specific ligand 3H-sa x itox in (Isom et al., 1995b; Meadows et al., 2001). In the present study, we used a different biochemical approach, sur face biotinylation followed by t wo rounds of immunoprecipitation, to compare the abilit y of w ild-t y pe 1 or C121W 1 to promote the cell sur face ex pression of sodium channels in our ecdysone-inducible cell lines. 1 and SNaII A-pI N D.C121W 1 cells, which ex- C121W 1 and wild-type 1 promote surface expression of sodium channels We have show n prev iously that coex pression of 1 in SNaII A Meadows et al.

T hese data prov ide additional biochemical ev idence for interaction bet ween and C121W 1 subunits. Neither w ild-t y pe 1 nor C121W 1 increases sodium current amplitude. 1 and C121W 1 subunits promote translocation of Nav1.2a s ubunits to the plasma membrane. 1, or SNaII A-pI N D.C121W 1 cells were treated w ith vehicle or 20 M ponasterone for 48 hr in culture and treated w ith sul fo-N HS-biotin as described in Materials and Methods. 1 or SNaII A-pI N D.C121W 1 cells w ith vehicle does not result in translocation of Nav1.2a sodium channels to the cell sur face. 1 or SNaII A-pI N D.C121W 1 cells w ith 20 M ponasterone (resulting in 1 or C121 1 subunit ex pression, as show n in Fig. high concentrations of C121W 1 actually decreased whole-cell currents (Fig. C121W 1 subunits do not induce cellular aggregation T he data presented in the preceding sections suggest that loss of 1 f unctional modulation caused by the C121W mutation may increase neuronal excitabilit y by subtly altering channel behav ior. We investigated the effects of the C121W mutation on 1-mediated cell adhesi ve interactions by examining the behav ior of Drosophila S2 cells ex pressing w ild-t y pe or mutant 1 subunits. cDNA s of interest are cloned into the S2 cell ex pression vector, pR mHa3, under control of an inducible crease in sodium current amplitude a fter induction of w ild-t y pe 1 or C121W 1 subunits. Similarly, neither w ild-t y pe 1 nor C121W 1 increased the amplitude of sodium currents in C NahIII-12 cells (Fig. In ooc y tes, injection of moderate concentrations of w ild-t y pe 1 or C121W 1 did not a ffect current amplitude, whereas injection of Meadows et al. Both w ild-t y pe 1 and C121W 1 subunits are efficiently expressed in S2 cells as assessed by Western blot analysi s (Fig. In contrast, C121W 1-transfected cells (Fig. I mmunoc ytochemical ex periments using an antibody di rected to the ex tracellular domain of 1 (anti- 1EX) (Malhotra et al., 2000) showed that C121W 1 subunit protein was ex pressed on the cell sur face of the transfected S2 cells (Fig. C oex pression of w ild-t y pe 1 and C121W 1 in S2 cells did not di srupt cell aggregation (Fig. 12), indicating that C121W 1 did not act as a dominant negati ve for cell adhesion. In thi s study, we have identified several effects of the C121W 1 mutation that could contribute to neuronal pathophysiolog y. Fi rst, using t wo different mammalian cell lines, one stably ex pressing the human Nav1.3 sodium channel and the other stably ex pressing the rat Nav1.2a sodium channel, we show that sodium channels in cells ex pressing C121W 1 have subtly different f unctional properties than channels in cells ex pressing w ild-t y pe 1. Second, using a Drosophila S2 cell adhesion assay, we show that the C121W mutation di srupts the cell adhesi ve properties of 1. Finally, we show that C121W 1 does not occlude 1-mediated f unctional modulation or cell adhesion in competition ex periments. C121W 1 alters sodium channel function GEFS , like other epilepsies, i s a parox ysmal di sorder, characteri z ed by brief sei z ures separated by long periods of ostensibly normal behav ior (Scheffer and Berkov ic, 1997). T he C121W mutation di srupts 1 1 homophilic interactions. Wild-t y pe 1- or C121W 1-transfected S2 cells were solubili z ed in 5% SDS and boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 5% -mercaptoethanol. B, C121W 1 subunit ex pression does not promote S2 cell aggregation. A n aliquot of each cell line was removed and stained for 1 or C121W 1 ex pression at the cell sur face (lef t panel ). Aggregation was not obser ved in cells transfected w ith C121W 1 in any field of v iew. T hus, we suggest that di sruption of homophilic 1 1 interactions or heterophilic interaction bet ween 1 and contactin (K a z arinovaNoyes et al., 2001) or neurofascin (Ratcliffe et al., 2001), caused by the C121W mutation, contributes to the GEFS phenotype, perhaps through abnormal subcellular channel locali z ation. C121W 1 is not a dominant-negative subunit for modulation of channel function Fig ure 12. C121W 1 does not exert a dominant-negati ve effect on cell adhesion in Drosophila S2 cells. Stable S2 1 cell lines (Malhotra et al., 2000) were transfected w ith increasing amounts of C121W 1 plasmid, as indicated above, using Fugene reagent. Representati ve fields of v iew are presented for 0 (S2 1), 1, and 5 g of transfected C121W 1 plasmid, respecti vely. 1 f unction, caused by the C121W mutation, results in comparably subtle alterations in sodium channel behav ior compared w ith channels associated w ith w ild-t y pe 1. In contrast, and consi stent w ith prev ious findings using the skeletal muscle sodium channel ex pressed in human embr yonic kidney cells (Tammaro et al., 2002), we did not obser ve an effect of w ild-t y pe 1 or C121W 1 on sodium current time course. T he difference bet ween 1 and C121W 1 in frequenc y-dependent rundow n i s especially intriguing, because similar effects have been obser ved for the GEFS t y pe 2 mutations R1648H (Spampanato et al., 2001) and D188V ( sour unpubli shed obser vations) in the Nav1.1 sodium channel ubunit. T he C121W mutation i s ex pected to di srupt the structure of the Ig loop, yet, surpri singly, our data indicate that the mutant 1 can still associate w ith and, at least in ooc y tes, can still modulate channel f unction, albeit only w ith ex pression of high levels of mutant subunit. In CHO cells, on the other hand, f unctional modulation by the mutant 1 subunit appears to be lost completely, although and C121W 1 associate in coimmunoprecipitation assays. T he relati ve levels of RNA requi red to achieve f unctional modulation in ooc y tes suggest that 1 and C121W 1 differ by roughly t wo orders of magnitude in thei r a ffinit y for . Furthermore, C121W 1 does not suppress 1 1-mediated homophilic interactions in the S2 cell adhesion assay, suggesting that it does not act as a dominant negati ve for the cell adhesion properties of 1. In summar y, these data argue against a dominant-negati ve effect of C121W 1 and suggest that haploin sufficienc y of the w ild-t y pe 1 may be a more likely ex planation for the dominant inheritance of the GEFS phenotype. Conclusion In summar y, our data suggest that loss of 1-mediated f unctional modulation and cell adhesion, caused by the C121W mutation, results in subtle changes in the f unction and subcellular di stribution of brain sodium channels, which in turn increases neuronal excitabilit y and predi sposes indi v iduals w ith the mutant allele toward sei z ures. T he data also argue against a dominant-negati ve effect of the C121W mutation. T he C121W mutation C121W disrupts 1-mediated cell adhesion Sodium channel 1 subunits are multif unctional proteins.

10952963	Molecular Pharmacology of the Sodium Channel Mutation D1790G Linked to the Long-QT Syndrome H. D1790G (DG), an LQT-3 mutation of the C-terminal region of the Na hannel -subunit, alters steady-state inactivation of expressed channels but does not promote sustained Na channel activity. 2000;102:921-925.) Key Words: sodium ion channels antiarrhythmia agents pharmacology electrophysiology genes he congenital long-QT syndrome is an inherited cardiac disorder defined by prolonged ventricular repolarization, recurrent syncope, a propensity to polymorphous ventricular tachycardia (torsades de pointes), and sudden death.1,2 Molecular genetic studies have identified defects in the -subunit of the cardiac voltage-gated ion channel (SCN5A) that are linked to 1 form of the disease: LQT-3.3 Initial functional c analysis of most SCN5A mutations has revealed mutant Na hannels that fail to inactivate completely on prolonged depolarization,4 8 a property sufficient to delay repolarization of the ventricular action potential and increase vulnerability of the heart to arrhythmias.9 In contrast, the D1790G (DG) SCN5A mutation,10 located in the cytoplasmic region of the -subunit C-terminus, causes a marked negative shift in the relationship between channel availability and membrane potential and alters inactivation kinetics of mutant channels11 but does not promote sustained inward current.7 Pharmacological analysis of LQT-3 mutant channels expressed heterologously has provided evidence that sodium channel blockers that interact with either the inactivated or open state of the channel12,13 effectively block maintained current conducted by mutant channels,14 20 shorten action T potential duration in cellular studies,21,22 and in preliminary studies correct QT prolongation in patients.22,23 Because the biophysical properties of the DG mutation do not promote maintained current during the action potential plateau phase, it had been suggested that agents such as lidocaine would not be effective in correcting the disease phenotype linked to this mutation.7 Clinical studies24 have confirmed this prediction but, in addition, have shown that flecainide, which preferentially blocks open but not inactivated channels,25 is effective in correcting DG-induced QT prolongation in patients carrying the DG gene defect. This prediction is confirmed in the experiments summarized in Figure Effect of DG Mutation on Recovery From Flecainide Block Block that accumulates as a consequence of repetitive channel activity (UDB) is caused by a balance between the time Abriel et al Molecular Pharmacology of D1790G LQT-3 Mutation 923 Figure 2. Interestingly, Abriel et al Molecular Pharmacology of D1790G LQT-3 Mutation 925 flecainide has also recently been shown to be very effective in treating carriers of the KPQ LQT-3 mutation (A.J. Importantly, 1 other nonconservative C-terminus LQT-3 mutation (E1784K) has been reported recently,6 and a C-terminus insertion mutation (1795insD) has been linked to both Brugada's syndrome and LQT-3.31 Our work strongly suggests that these mutations may also modify the interactions of the encoded channels by flecainide (and probably other drugs), raising the possibility of pharmacological targeting of a broad range of mutation-induced phenotypes.

Noticeably, the Y522S mutation was identified in a core-associated MHS French family that presented without congenital myopathy (23), while the I4898T mutation was responsible for a severe form of CCD (3).

10827976	Under the macroscopic current recording conditions used here, the mutation T338A changes the halide selectivity from Eisenman sequence III to sequence I, consistent with the strengthening of lyotropic selectivity in this mutant Biophysical Journal 78(6) 29732982 (Linsdell et al., 1998). In contrast, both F337A and F337S showed dramatically altered anion selectivity (Fig. As described previously for wild-type CFTR (Linsdell and Hanrahan, 1998a), the mutants F337A, F337S, and F337Y all showed negligible Na permeability (Table 1). The altered anion selectivity of F337A and F337S led to a disruption of the relationship between anion permeability and hydration energy in these mutants (Fig. In contrast, for both F337A and F337S, there was no obvious correlation between anion permeability and energy of hydration (Fig. In contrast, the two mutations that strongly affect selectivity, F337A and F337S, both involve a substantial reduction in amino acid sidechain volume. Note that the range of reversal potentials with different anions is greatly reduced in both F337A and F337S, indicating a reduced ability of the channel to discriminate between different anions. Estimation of the functional diameter of the CFTR pore is difficult and ambiguous because of the highly asymmetrical permeability of large organic anions (Linsdell and CFTR Chloride Channel Selectivity Filter TABLE 1 Relative permeability of intracellular ions in wild-type and mutant CFTR Cl Wild type Cl 1.00 Br 1.37 I 0.83 F 0.103 SCN 3.55 NO3 1.58 ClO4 0.25 Formate 0.24 Acetate 0.091 0 Na .007 0.01 (10) 1.00 0.07 (8) 0.60 0.03 (6) 0.23 0.007 (9) 0.35 0.26 (7) 0.97 0.04 (10) 1.30 0.01 (8) 0.19 0.01 (9) 0.27 0.003 (10) 0.073 0.010 (24) 0.001 F337A 0.04 (6) 1.00 0.04 (4)** 0.50 0.04 (5)** 0.23 0.01 (4)** 0.43 0.05 (4)** 0.93 0.03 (3)* 1.08 0.00 (3)* 0.17 0.02 (3) 0.33 0.004 (3)* 0.12 0.018 (3) 0.001 F337S 0.08 (3) 0.04 (4)** 0.02 (4)** 0.02 (4)** 0.10 (5)** 0.02 (4)** 0.03 (4)* 0.03 (4)* 0.02 (5) 0.021 (5) 1.00 1.22 0.39 0.15 2.85 1.38 0.23 0.35 F337L 0.02 (5) 1.00 0.04 (5) 1.39 0.01 (3)** 0.69 0.02 (3)* 0.095 0.20 (4) 3.05 0.03 (4)* 1.43 0.04 (3) 0.15 0.02 (3)* 0.24 -- 0.092 -- 0.002 c 2977 hannels F337W 0.03 (5) 1.00 0.05 (4)* 1.74 -- 0.99 0.009 (3) 0.075 0.56 (4) 3.27 0.03 (3) 1.71 -- 0.24 -- 0.28 -- 0.076 -- I344A 0.01 (9) 0.01 (3)* 0.05 (4)* 0.012 (5)* 0.30 (5) 0.06 (4) 0.02 (3) 0.01 (3) 0.007 (3) -- F337Y 0.02 (6) 1.00 0.04 (3) 1.12 0.03 (7)* 0.009 (3) 0.081 0.29 (4) 4.42 0.04 (3) 1.62 0.01 (4)** 0.01 (3) 0.014 (4) 0.004 (3) Relative permeabilities for different anions present in the intracellular solution under biionic conditions were calculated from macroscopic current reversal potentials (e.g., Fig. We used a similar approach to determine whether the altered anion selectivity of F337A and F337S was associated with any change in functional pore diameter (Table 3). The permeabilities of F337A and F337S to extracellular formate, acetate, and propanoate ions were not significantly different from those observed in wild-type CFTR, and both pyruvate and methane sulfonate were not measurably permeant in wild type, F337A, or F337S. However, the effects of the mutations F337A and F337S, which virtually abolish the normal lyotropic anion selectivity sequence (Tables 1 and 2 and Fig. Although we cannot rule out this possibility, we feel that the fact that mutations at two adjacent TM6 residues, F337 (this study) and T338 (Linsdell et al., 1998), significantly affect c TABLE 2 Anion selectivity sequences for wild-type and mutant CFTR Cl Wild-type F337A F337S F337L F337Y I344A SCN NO3 NO3 SCN SCN SCN N C hannels I F F I I I O3 l C l N N S O3 O3 B r r S CN S CN B r B r N O3 B l r B r C l C l C l B C ClO4 form form form form form f orm I I ClO4 ClO4 ClO4 F lO4 C lO4 C F F a a a ce ce a ce ace F ce equences were derived from the relative anion permeabilities given in Table 1. Furthermore, the mutations F337A and F337S altered selectivity between different anions without disrupting the ability of the channel to select for Cl over Na (Table 1), supporting the hypothesis that the CFTR pore uses different mechanisms to determine lyotropic anion selectivity and anion:cation selectivity (Linsdell et al., 1998; Guinamard and Akabas, 1999). Nevertheless, it is clear that in CFTR, interactions between permeating anions and the pore do influence anion selectivity, because point mutations in the channel (F337A and F337S) disrupt the selectivity sequence. Both F337A and F337S compromise the relationship between anion permeability and hydration energy (Fig. One possible explanation for the loss of the relationship between anion permeability and hydration energy in F337A and F337S is that anions are able to pass through the pores of these mutants with more of their associated waters of hydration intact than in wild type, so reducing the degree of anion dehydration required for permeation. hannels F337S 0.112 0.002 (3) 0.029 0.013 (3) 0.024 0.002 (3) 0.011 (3) 0.011 (2) Relative permeabilities for different organic anions present in the extracellular solution under biionic conditions were calculated as described in the legend to Table 1. In fact, for intracellular anions, the mutations F337A and F337S had a much stronger effect on the permeability of small anions (halides, SCN , NO3 ) than on larger anions (ClO4 , formate, acetate), suggesting that removal of a steric barrier is not the primary effect of these mutations (Table 1). Furthermore, neither F337A nor F337S showed greatly altered permeability to extracellular organic anions (Table 3), the permeabilities of which do appear to be limited by unhydrated anion size (Linsdell et al., 1997, 1998; Linsdell and Hanrahan, 1998a). Although the relationship between the permeability of such organic anions, when present in the extracellular solution, and the actual physical dimensions of the pore, is unclear (Linsdell and Hanrahan, 1998a), the results summarized in Table 3 do not suggest a strong alteration in the functional dimensions of the pore in F337A or F337S. A reduction in the relative importance of anion dehydration in determining permeability, as is suggested in F337A and F337S, could result not only from a decrease in the degree of anion dehydration, but also from an increase in the strength of the interaction between permeating anions and the channel pore. While the mutants F337L, F337Y, and I344A maintain Eisenman sequence III, both F337A and F337S convert the channel to a relatively strong field B F strength sequence (Cl r I ; Eisenman sequence V) (Table 2). This increase in field strength might imply that permeating anions interact more strongly with the pores of F337A and F337S than with wild-type CFTR. Consistent with this, CFTR single-channel conductance (measured with symmetrical 154 mM Cl ) is reduced from 7.6 0.1 pS (n 12) for wild type to 1.8 0.0 pS (n 7 ) for F337S (P. However, SCN permeability is reduced to a similar extent in F337A (hydrophobic) and F337S (polar), but is not altered in F337Y (polar) (Table 1), suggesting that SCN permeability is not influenced by hydrophobic interactions with the large, hydrophobic side chain of F337. How, then, might we explain the effects of the mutations F337A and F337S on anion selectivity? One way in which amino acid side-chain size might influence the strength of the interaction between permeating anions and the pore is by controlling how close the ion may come to a positive charge or dipole on the pore wall. Reduction of this steric effect in both F337A and F337S would allow the permeating anion CFTR Chloride Channel Selectivity Filter 2981 Arreola, J., J. F337W gave only small currents after expression in BHK cells, such that its full anion selectivity sequence could not be determined. 3), as well as F337L, F337W, and I344A (not shown; see Table 2), were able to select for anions that bound water molecules less strongly, consistent with the lyotropic selectivity sequence common to most classes of Cl channels (see Introduction).

Thus in wild-type CFTR (and to a similar extent F337L and F337Y), the bulky side chain at position 337 might impede the approach of permeating anions to a nearby anion-attracting group, ensuring relatively weak, long-distance interactions between the anion and this positive site. In contrast, both F337A and F337S showed dramatically altered anion selectivity (Fig. As described previously for wild-type CFTR (Linsdell and Hanrahan, 1998a), the mutants F337A, F337S, and F337Y all showed negligible Na permeability (Table 1).

The permeabilities of F337A and F337S to extracellular formate, acetate, and propanoate ions were not significantly different from those observed in wild-type CFTR, and both pyruvate and methane sulfonate were not measurably permeant in wild type, F337A, or F337S. However, the effects of the mutations F337A and F337S, which virtually abolish the normal lyotropic anion selectivity sequence (Tables 1 and 2 and Fig. Although we cannot rule out this possibility, we feel that the fact that mutations at two adjacent TM6 residues, F337 (this study) and T338 (Linsdell et al., 1998), significantly affect c TABLE 2 Anion selectivity sequences for wild-type and mutant CFTR Cl Wild-type F337A F337S F337L F337Y I344A SCN NO3 NO3 SCN SCN SCN N C hannels I F F I I I O3 l C l N N S O3 O3 B r r S CN S CN B r B r N O3 B l r B r C l C l C l B C ClO4 form form form form form f orm I I ClO4 ClO4 ClO4 F lO4 C lO4 C F F a a a ce ce a ce ace F ce equences were derived from the relative anion permeabilities given in Table 1. Furthermore, the mutations F337A and F337S altered selectivity between different anions without disrupting the ability of the channel to select for Cl over Na (Table 1), supporting the hypothesis that the CFTR pore uses different mechanisms to determine lyotropic anion selectivity and anion:cation selectivity (Linsdell et al., 1998; Guinamard and Akabas, 1999). Nevertheless, it is clear that in CFTR, interactions between permeating anions and the pore do influence anion selectivity, because point mutations in the channel (F337A and F337S) disrupt the selectivity sequence. Both F337A and F337S compromise the relationship between anion permeability and hydration energy (Fig. One possible explanation for the loss of the relationship between anion permeability and hydration energy in F337A and F337S is that anions are able to pass through the pores of these mutants with more of their associated waters of hydration intact than in wild type, so reducing the degree of anion dehydration required for permeation.

In fact, for intracellular anions, the mutations F337A and F337S had a much stronger effect on the permeability of small anions (halides, SCN , NO3 ) than on larger anions (ClO4 , formate, acetate), suggesting that removal of a steric barrier is not the primary effect of these mutations (Table 1). Furthermore, neither F337A nor F337S showed greatly altered permeability to extracellular organic anions (Table 3), the permeabilities of which do appear to be limited by unhydrated anion size (Linsdell et al., 1997, 1998; Linsdell and Hanrahan, 1998a). Although the relationship between the permeability of such organic anions, when present in the extracellular solution, and the actual physical dimensions of the pore, is unclear (Linsdell and Hanrahan, 1998a), the results summarized in Table 3 do not suggest a strong alteration in the functional dimensions of the pore in F337A or F337S. A reduction in the relative importance of anion dehydration in determining permeability, as is suggested in F337A and F337S, could result not only from a decrease in the degree of anion dehydration, but also from an increase in the strength of the interaction between permeating anions and the channel pore. While the mutants F337L, F337Y, and I344A maintain Eisenman sequence III, both F337A and F337S convert the channel to a relatively strong field B F strength sequence (Cl r I ; Eisenman sequence V) (Table 2). This increase in field strength might imply that permeating anions interact more strongly with the pores of F337A and F337S than with wild-type CFTR. However, SCN permeability is reduced to a similar extent in F337A (hydrophobic) and F337S (polar), but is not altered in F337Y (polar) (Table 1), suggesting that SCN permeability is not influenced by hydrophobic interactions with the large, hydrophobic side chain of F337. How, then, might we explain the effects of the mutations F337A and F337S on anion selectivity? One way in which amino acid side-chain size might influence the strength of the interaction between permeating anions and the pore is by controlling how close the ion may come to a positive charge or dipole on the pore wall. Reduction of this steric effect in both F337A and F337S would allow the permeating anion CFTR Chloride Channel Selectivity Filter 2981 Arreola, J., J.

Here we address further the role for AKR activity in Kv1 channel trafficking by mutating only the side chain hydroxyl group of this critical catalytic tyrosine residue in Kv 1.1 (Y124F) and Kv 2 (Y90F), and using a variety of biochemical and cell biological assays to analyze the effects of this mutation on Kv1.2 trafficking in mammalian cells. Similar to the results obtained with Kv 2 Tyr-90, the Kv 1.1 Y124F mutant had wild-type characteristics. Thus, eliminating the critical side chain hydroxyl group in the Kv 2 Y90F and Kv 1.1 Y124F mutants, although retaining the overall hydrophobicity and size of the residue, should eliminate catalysis in Kv s as it does in other AKRs. The complete lack of effects of the Kv 2 Y90F and Kv 1.1 Y124F mutations on any measurable aspect of Kv1.2 trafficking in COS-1 cells, and on axonal targeting in neurons, argues strongly against a role for AKR catalytic activity in these Kv subunit-mediated events. It should also be noted that the Kv 1.1 Y124F mutation also had no effect on the ability of Kv 1.1 to confer N-type inactivation to Kv1.5 (11). In only one case was the same mutation (W277A) analyzed, thus some of these differences may result from the differences in specific side chain substitution used in the two different studies. A, confocal images of COS-1 cells transfected with wild-type (WT) Kv 1.1 or Kv 1.1 W277V and stained for total Kv 1.1. Axonal targeting was observed in far fewer cells when Kv1.2 was coexpressed with Kv 1.1 W277V (Fig. Mutation of the analogous tyrosine (Tyr-48) in human aldose reductase to phenylalanine (Y48F), which preserves both the spatial fit and hydrophobicity of the tyrosine residue yet eliminates the possibility of any general acid catalysis by removing the tyrosine hydroxyl group, led to a completely inactive enzyme (10). A mutation in Kv 2 analogous to our Kv 1.1 cofactor binding mutation R298D (Kv 2 R264E) resulted in a complete loss of NADPH binding (48). The Kv 1.1 Y124H mutation, however, eliminated the ability of Kv 1.1 to promote surface expression of Kv1.2 in COS-1 cells.

Here we address further the role for AKR activity in Kv1 channel trafficking by mutating only the side chain hydroxyl group of this critical catalytic tyrosine residue in Kv 1.1 (Y124F) and Kv 2 (Y90F), and using a variety of biochemical and cell biological assays to analyze the effects of this mutation on Kv1.2 trafficking in mammalian cells. A, COS-1 cells were cotransfected with Kv1.2 and either RBG4 ( ), wild-type Kv 2, Kv 2 Y90F, or Kv 2 Y90A at 1:4 cDNA ratios. To determine the role of the potential Kv subunit enzymatic activity in Kv1 channel trafficking experimentally, we made the analogous tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation (Y90F) in Kv 2. When coexpressed with Kv1.2 in COS-1 cells at a fixed / subunit cDNA ratio of 1:4, the Kv 2 Y90F mutant was indistinguishable from wild-type Kv 2 in its effects on promoting increased surface expression of Kv1.2 (Fig. Lysates from cells expressing Kv 2 Y90F have levels of this post-ER form of Kv1.2 similar to those found in cultures coexpressing wild-type Kv 2, whereas extracts from cells coexpressing Kv 2 Y90A were similar to those without Kv subunit coexpression (Fig. Together these data show that the Kv 2 Y90F mutation, which, based on previous studies, should eliminate any AKR activity of Kv 2, is phenotypically identical to wild-type Kv 2 in its effects on Kv1.2 trafficking, whereas Kv 2 Y90A exhibits little or no trafficking activity. When expressed in COS-1 cells, both wild-type Kv 2 (7) and the Kv 2 Y90F mutant exhibit a diffuse cytoplasmic localization (Fig. A, confocal images of COS-1 cells transfected with wild-type Kv 2, Kv 2 Y90F, or Kv 2 Y90A and stained with an anti-Kv antibody. B, confocal images of COS-1 cells cotransfected with Kv1.2 and RBG4 vector, wild-type (WT) Kv 2, Kv 2 Y90F, or Kv 2 Y90A at 1:4 cDNA ratios and double stained with an anti-Kv antibody (top panels) and an anti-Kv1.2 antibody (bottom panel). C, lysates from COS-1 expressing Kv1.2 and wild-type Kv 2, Kv 2 Y90F, or Kv 2 Y90A were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-Kv1.2 antibody ( ) or anti-Kv 2 antibody ( ) as indicated below the lanes. Neurons cotransfected with Kv1.2 and Kv 2 Y90F exhibited Kv1.2 staining on axons similar to that observed for wild-type Kv 2 (data not shown). Moreover, Kv 2 Y90F was almost as potent at inducing axonal localization of Kv1.2 as was wild-type Kv 2 (Fig. Thus, eliminating the critical side chain hydroxyl group in the Kv 2 Y90F and Kv 1.1 Y124F mutants, although retaining the overall hydrophobicity and size of the residue, should eliminate catalysis in Kv s as it does in other AKRs. The complete lack of effects of the Kv 2 Y90F and Kv 1.1 Y124F mutations on any measurable aspect of Kv1.2 trafficking in COS-1 cells, and on axonal targeting in neurons, argues strongly against a role for AKR catalytic activity in these Kv subunit-mediated events. However, a catalytic site double mutation in Kv 2 (D85A/ Y90F) led to an observed loss of the Kv 2-mediated enhancement of Kv1.4 plasma membrane trafficking in Xenopus oocytes (22). (22) and those presented here are the result of these inherent differences between Kv1.2 and Kv1.4 trafficking, differences between the oocyte and mammalian expression backgrounds, or unintentional effects of the Y90F/D85A double mutation on Kv 2 structure, with a subsequent loss of Kv 2 trafficking effects, is not known.

A, COS-1 cells were cotransfected with Kv1.2 and either RBG4 ( ), wild-type Kv 2, Kv 2 Y90F, or Kv 2 Y90A at 1:4 cDNA ratios. A less subtle Kv 2 Y90A mutation was also made. In contrast, the Kv 2 Y90A mutant failed to induce increased surface expression of Kv1.2 and was not significantly different from no Kv s ubunit addition (Fig. As such, the lack of activity of Kv 2 Y90A is not simply the result of differences in expression level. Lysates from cells expressing Kv 2 Y90F have levels of this post-ER form of Kv1.2 similar to those found in cultures coexpressing wild-type Kv 2, whereas extracts from cells coexpressing Kv 2 Y90A were similar to those without Kv subunit coexpression (Fig. Together these data show that the Kv 2 Y90F mutation, which, based on previous studies, should eliminate any AKR activity of Kv 2, is phenotypically identical to wild-type Kv 2 in its effects on Kv1.2 trafficking, whereas Kv 2 Y90A exhibits little or no trafficking activity. However, we found that the Kv 2 Y90A mutant is present as perinuclear clusters suggestive of a misfolded phenotype (Fig. Moreover, the altered localization of Kv 2 Y90A is conferred to coexpressed Kv1.2 (Fig. These results suggest that the Kv 2 Y90A mutant retains its ability to interact with Kv1.2 but that this interaction does not allow for enhanced surface expression of Kv1.2. To determine directly whether the lack of ability of Kv 2 Y90A to promote Kv1.2 surface expression was not simply the result of a lack of association, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments. 4C, each of the wild-type and mutant Kv 2 subunits is found associated with Kv1.2, although the interaction of Kv1.2 with the Kv 2 Y90A mutant is slightly less robust. Thus, the lack of ability of Kv 2 Y90A to promote the surface expression of Kv1.2 is not simply the result of a lack of interaction.

Substitution of phenylalanine at the site of 1760 with lysine significantly enhanced the peak current densities in HEK293t cells transfected with the mutant F1760K. The average current density (elicited by voltage pulses from 150 to 30 mV) was 132 14 pA/pF for the wildtype (n 69) and 177 22 pA/pF for F1760K (n F 46 Vol. (B) Relative whole-cell activation conductances for the wildtype (E, n 32), Y1767K (F, n 28), F1760K (OE, n 2 9), and N406K (s, n 22) of hH1 Na channels.

Compared to the wildtype, the values of the V 1/2 and k (slope) of activation were not significantly altered after point mutations at D1-S6 (N406K) and D4-S6 (F1760K and Y1767K). The average V 1/2 and k values fitted with a Boltzmann equation were 53.8 1.64 mV and 13.9 47 .26 mV, respectively, for the wildtype (n 32); 50.1 0.81 mV and 8.2 0.47 mV, respectively, for Y1767K (n 28); 55.3 2.20 mV and 16.0 1.30 1 V, respectively, for F1760K (n m 29); and 51.5 .62 mV and 10.4 1.37 mV, respectively, for N406K (n 22).

These results s dhow that the mutants, F1760K and N406K, of hH1 o not significantly alter the steady-state inactivation of I Na, , but a point mutation (Y1767K) does. Figure 3 shows that with the 100 ms recovery interval, I Na of the mutant Y1767K, was significantly reduced when voltages of conditioning pulses were depolarized above 120 mV, whereas I Na of the wildtype, F1760K, and N406K of hH1 w as not affected by the voltages of conditioning pulses (Fig. (B) Whole-cell currents were normalized by I Na recorded with the conditioning voltage of 180 mV for the wildtype (E, n 11), Y1767K (F, n 10), F1760K (OE, n 7), and N406K (s, n 19).

This is consistent with a recently reported finding with the isoform Y1586K of a rat skeletal muscle sodium channel ( 1) (16). The mutants F1760K, Y1767K, and N406K, separately and to different extents, affected the current density, the steady-state inactivation potential, accelerated inactivation, delayed recovery from inactivation, and affected voltage-dependent block, but did not affect activation of the hH1 .

Figure 3 shows that with the 100 ms recovery interval, I Na of the mutant Y1767K, was significantly reduced when voltages of conditioning pulses were depolarized above 120 mV, whereas I Na of the wildtype, F1760K, and N406K of hH1 w as not affected by the voltages of conditioning pulses (Fig. With the 5 ms recovery interval, the reduction of I Na of the mutant Y1767K was even more profound when the voltages of conditioning pulses were depolarized above 120 mV (Fig. (B) Whole-cell currents were normalized by I Na recorded with the conditioning voltage of 180 mV for the wildtype (E, n 11), Y1767K (F, n 10), F1760K (OE, n 7), and N406K (s, n 19).

On the other hand, the average V 1/2 of the fast steady-state inactivation curve of I Na for the mutant N406K was -94 1.0 mV with a k value of 6.5 0.5 mV (n 18). These results suggest that functional association of the 1-subunit with hH1 or its mutant N406K causes a significant shift of the fast steadystate inactivation to the depolarizing direction and the shift for the wildtype of hH1 is even greater. To test whether coexpression of the 1-subunit with hH1 or with its mutant N406K affected voltagedependent inactivation, we depolarized patched HEK 293t cells to various voltages.

To examine the effects of the 1-subunit on the kinetics of Na currents, we coexpressed the 1-subunits with hH1 or with its N406K mutant in HEK293t cells. The reason for using N406K in this experiment is that we have found that the single point mutation N406K of hH1 significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of the polyunsaturated fatty acids on Na currents (Xiao et al., unpublished data). (B) Peak current densities evoked by test pulses were averaged for the wildtype 132 14 pA/pF (n 69), wildtype 1-subunit 176 14 pA/pF (n 7), N406K 73 9 pA/pF (n 32, and N406K 1 113 11 pA/pF (n 19). It is evident that coexpression with the 1-subunit increases the current density of N406K by the same amount as for the wildtype, 44 and 40 pA/pF, respectively. for N406K plus the 1-subunit was similar to that of the wildtype. These results indicate that coexpression of hH1 and the 1-subunit accelerates the slow voltagedependent inactivation, but not for the mutant N406K.

Received March 1, 1999; accepted June 14, 1999 This paper is available online at http://www.molpharm.org ABSTRACT We mutated a conserved aspartate in the second transmembrane domain of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor to asparagine (D164N), stably transfected it into AtT20 cells, and examined the coupling of this mutant receptor to several intracellular effectors that are targets of wild-type CB1 receptor activation. We found that the D164N receptor binds the CB1 agonist WIN 55,212-2 with an affinity matching that of the wild-type CB1 receptor and inhibits Ca2 currents and cAMP production with an equivalent potency and efficacy. In addition, we made a reciprocal mutation that exchanged the aspartate with an asparagine in the seventh transmembrane region (D164N/ N394D). However, activation of D164N/N394D did not potentiate KIR current, nor did it internalize. AtT20 cells stably transfected with rat CB1 (Mackie et al., 1995) or D164N were plated on polylysine-coated coverslips and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 10% heat-inactivated horse serum 1:200 penicillin/ streptomycin 400 g/ml G418 in a humidified environment with 5% CO2 at 37C. We also examined whether any disruptive effects of D164N were a consequence of loss of an interaction between D164 and N394 in the seventh transmembrane region. For this purpose, we compared the coupling of D164N to that of D164N/N394D. For binding studies, AtT20 cells transfected with pcDNA3 (control), CB1, or CB1-D164N were grown to confluency in 500-cm2 plates. AtT20 cells stably expressing either wild-type CB1 or D164N were treated as indicated in the figure legends. Additional experiments were performed with cells that were incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium containing 10 or 100 nM SR141716A (SR; [N-9-piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide hydrochloride]) plus 1 mg/ml BSA, which was exchanged with fresh D164N of CB1 Disrupts G Protein Signaling were always performed. 613 Results A D164N Point Mutation of the CB1 Receptor Does Not Affect Agonist Binding to the Receptor or Receptor-Mediated Inhibition of Forskolin-Induced cAMP Production. To test whether D164 contributed to agonist binding to the CB1 receptor, we measured specific binding of [3H]WIN 55,212-2 to membranes containing D164N and compared the values to those for wt CB1. The specific binding of the synthetic CB1 agonist [3H]WIN 55,212-2 to AtT20 cell membranes that expressed D164N receptor (Kd 5.5 1.3 nM, Fig. The Bmax for [3H]WIN 55,212-2 binding was also similar for D164N (390 4 0 fmol/mg, Fig. These data indicate that expression levels as well as affinity for the synthetic agonist [3H]WIN 55,212-2 are similar for D164N and the wt CB1 receptor for the cell lines studied. We tested for the ability of the mutant receptor to inhibit forskolin-induced cAMP production and found that after application of 200 nM WIN to cells stably expressing D164N, forskolin-induced cAMP production was inhibited by 33%, compared with 25% for cells expressing wt CB1 (Fig. The IC50 for inhibition of adenylyl cyclase was similar for wt CB1 and D164N (data not shown). Hence, the D164N receptor remains capable of inhibiting adenylyl cyclase when the receptor is expressed in AtT20 cells. We found that the CB1 agonist WIN caused an inhibition of IBa in cells expressing D164N (Fig. A D164N point mutation of the CB1 receptor does not affect agonist binding to the receptor, nor does it affect receptor-mediated inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP production.

Also shown is the mean inhibition of barium current after overnight incubation with pertussis toxin (o) for cells expressing wt CB1 (n 3) or D164N (n 3). The maximal inhibition of peak current amplitude by 200 nM WIN was also similar for cells expressing either wt CB1 or D164N-CB1 receptors (Fig. The WIN-induced inhibition of IBa was blocked by overnight incubation with PTX in cells expressing D164N as well as in cells expressing wt CB1 (Fig. 2C), implicating a G protein from the Gi/Go family in the inhibition, via D164N, as well as wt CB1. Thus, the D164N mutation does c not alter the ability of the CB1 receptor to inhibit Ca2 hannels or the nature of the inhibition.

Also shown is the potentiation of KIR via an endogenous somatostatin receptor (s) in the cells expressing wt CB1 (left; n 6) or D164N (right; n 14). Shown are the results obtained for both wt CB1 (F; n 5 8) and D164N (E; n 27). The D164N dose-response curve could not be fitted. tor that is homologous to the D164N mutation of the CB1 receptor has previously been shown to block coupling of the 2-receptor to activation of the KIR current in these cells (Surprenant et al., 1992). We tested whether cells expressing the D164N receptor were still capable of activating KIR current in response to a CB1 agonist. We found that, unlike wt CB1, the D164N receptor could not activate KIR (Fig. However, the KIR current could still be activated in the D164N-expressing cells by activation of the endogenous somatostatin receptor. The mean potentiation of KIR current by 200 nM WIN was 4.0 0.6 pA/pF for wt CB1-expressing cells but only 0.3 0.2 pA/pF for cells expressing D164N. At all WIN concentrations tested, we found very little potentiation of KIR current in D164N cells (Fig. Thus, the D164N mutation largely abolishes the ability of the CB1 receptor to activate KIR. Previous mutations in other seven-transmembrane receptors of aspartate residues homologous to D164N in the CB1 receptor have shown effects on agonist binding. Therefore, we wanted to test a structurally dissimilar CB1 agonist, CP-55,940 (CP; {1 -2-(R)-5(1,1dimethylheptyl)-2-[5-hydroxy-2-(3-hydroxypropyl)cyclohexyl]-phenol}), to preclude the possibility that the failure of WIN to activate the KIR current in D164N cells was specific to this agonist. Application of CP to cells expressing D164N did not activate the KIR current, whereas application of somatostatin caused a robust activation of KIR current in the same cells (Fig. However, CP inhibited Ca2 channels when applied to D164N- expressing cells (Fig. Thus, the loss of activation of the KIR current after the D164N mutation is not specific to the agonist WIN. Because we have documented above a selective disruption in signaling via the D164N mutant, we wanted to know whether this mutation affected receptor internalization. Longer D164N of CB1 Disrupts G Protein Signaling 615 exposure (up to 1 h) also failed to cause any internalization of the mutant receptor (data not shown). With this hypothesis in mind, and the knowledge that activation of CB1 receptors increases MAP kinase activity (Bouaboula et al., 1995), we asked whether the expressed D164N receptors also coupled to the MAP kinase phosphorylation cascade. Contrary to our expectations based on the 2-adrenergic receptor results, we observed a dose-dependent increase in the amount of phosphorylated p42/44 MAP kinase in cells expressing the D164N receptor after a 10-min exposure to WIN (Fig. We also repeated the internalization experiments under pretreatment conditions similar to those used for the MAP kinase experiments to better compare the results from these separate experiments and found no difference in either the internalization of wt CB1 or lack of internalization of D164N. Inability of the D164N mutant receptor to potentiate KIR currents is not agonist specific.

The D164N mutation blocks the receptor's ability to internalize on agonist exposure but does not block MAP kinase activation. A, a confocal image of AtT20 cells stably expressing either wt CB1 (top) or D164N (bottom) stained with antibody specific for the N terminus of the CB1 receptor. AtT20 cells stably expressing either wt CB1 or D164N were incubated in serum-free media for 15 min at 37C with the CB1 antagonist SR (10 nM) in addition to the various concentrations of WIN indicated above each lane as well as the PKC activator PMA (1 M) and the MAP kinase-kinase inhibitor PD (100 M). Differences in basal activity of the wt CB1 and D164N receptors are also unlikely because phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), which activates the MAP kinase pathway in a receptor-independent manner, increased the phosphorylated MAP kinase signal equivalently in both cell lines (Fig. This result indicates that not only is internalization of the CB1 receptor not necessary for MAP kinase activation, but that the altered G protein coupling or the lack of internalization caused by the D164N mutation actually enhances coupling of activation of the CB1 receptor to phosphorylation of p42/44 MAP kinase. A Reciprocal Mutation (D164N,N394D) Does Not Restore the Ability to Potentiate KIR Currents or Internalize on Agonist Exposure. Here we tested whether a similar double mutation could restore functional coupling of the D164N receptor. We stably expressed a double mutant D164N/N394D construct in AtT20 cells and observed that 200 nM WIN produced no activation of the KIR current (Fig. Application of 100 nM WIN also failed to cause internalization of the D164N/ N394D receptor (Fig. A reciprocal mutation (D164N/N394D) does not restore the receptor's ability to potentiate KIR currents or internalize on agonist exposure.

E, confocal images of AtT20 cells stably expressing either wt CB1 (top) or the double point mutant D164N/N394D (bottom) stained with antibody specific for the N terminus of the CB1 receptor. D164N of CB1 Disrupts G Protein Signaling 617 thought to result from direct binding of G protein subunits. Because these two actions are differentially affected by the D164N mutation, after the D164N mutation, the CB1 receptor would have to specifically couple to a PTX-sensitive G protein with a subunit that is capable of modulating IBa but not KIR. Our results could be explained if the D164N mutation interfered with colocalization of the CB1 receptor with KIR channels but not with Ca2 channels. The D164N mutation likely prevents internalization at a step before clustering of the receptor in clathrincoated pits, inasmuch as the antibody staining remains evenly distributed over the entire membrane. We have shown here, however, that mutation of D164 had no effect on agonist (WIN 55,212-2) binding to the CB1 receptor, indicating that this residue was not a necessary component of the WIN binding pocket, and that any conformational change caused by the D164N mutation does not impact binding of agonist to this pocket. However, when we made this double mutation in the CB1 receptor, the mutated receptor behaved similarly to the D164N mutant rather than the wild-type CB1 receptor. Our results indicate that the D164N mutation had no effect on inhibition of cAMP production or binding of the CB1 agonist WIN 55,212-2. We have found that the CB1-D164N mutant, a GPCR that does not internalize, is capable of activating p42/44 MAP kinase, indicating that receptor internalization is not necessary for activation of this cascade. A less likely explanation is that D164N may have a low level of internalization, undetectable through the use of specific antibodies, that is sufficient to fully activate the MAP kinase cascade. Even more surprising was the finding that the D164N mutant activated p42/44 MAP kinase better than wt receptor, suggesting that the mutated receptor coupling to G proteins involved in activation of the p42/44 MAP kinase cascade may be enhanced. In addition, we made a reciprocal mutation that exchanged the aspartate with an asparagine in the seventh transmembrane region (D164N/ N394D). However, activation of D164N/N394D did not potentiate KIR current, nor did it internalize. For this purpose, we compared the coupling of D164N to that of D164N/N394D. A Reciprocal Mutation (D164N,N394D) Does Not Restore the Ability to Potentiate KIR Currents or Internalize on Agonist Exposure.

All affected family members carried the threonine to methionine substitution at codon 704 (T704M) in exon 13 of the skeletal muscle voltage gated sodium channel gene (SCN4A). The association between T704M and the hyperPP/PMC phenotype has been only recently revealed. These data further broaden the clinical spectrum of T704M and support the evidence that this mutation is a common cause of hyperPP/PMC. Onset of paramyotonia is usually at bir th.2 HyperPP/PMC shows characteristics of both hyperPP and PMC with var ying degrees of overlap and has been repor ted in association with eight mutations in SCN4A gene (I693T, T704M, A1156T, T1313M, M1360V, M1370V, R1448C, M1592V).39 While T704M is an impor tant cause of isolated hyperPP, this mutation has been only recently described in a single hyperPP/PMC family. As with other SCN4A mutations, there can be marked intrafamilial and interfamilial variability in paralytic attack frequency and severity in patients harbouring T704M.1012 We repor t an Italian kindred, in which all patients presented with an unusually severe and homogeneous hyperPP/PMC phenotype associated with the T704M. patient was screened for the two common mutations resulting in hyperPP (M1592V, T704M), by means of PCR amplification of the segment containing the mutation and digestion with restriction enzymes TaiI and NsiI respectively. All tested affected members were negative for the M1592V mutation but all harboured the T704M mutation in exon 13 as confir med by sequence analysis. None of the three unaffected individuals carried the T704M mutation. DISCUSSION We have investigated an Italian family with hyperPP/PMC carrying the T704M mutation in the SCN4A gene. This severe phenotype has never been reported in patients harbouring T704M. The association between T704M and hyperPP/PMC has been previously reported only in a Korean family by Kim and coworkers.4 Clinical comparison between the Korean family and the present family disclosed several common features, including similar precipitating factors, mild paramyotonia, calf hypertrophy, and fixed proximal weakness in affected adults. In family VV acetazolamide, hydrochlorothiazide, and salbutamol (inhaled or oral) were ineffective in preventing or aborting the episodes, in contrast with patients harbouring T704M, which often respond favourably to these treatments.11 15 Muscle biopsy revealed a vacuolar myopathy in one individual of the VV family, in agreement with other studies in families with the T704M mutation.16 Five of six affected individuals in VV family had normal serum potassium concentrations during episodes (see table 1). Each www.jnnp.com Severe infantile hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis with paramyotonia congenita and T704M 1341 It is interesting to speculate whether mutations in SCN4A could give rise to cardiac conduction defects in view of the ar rhythmias obser ved in individuals II:4 and II:6 in family VV. Although this could be related to a different disorder, McClatchey et al repor ted cardiac ar rhythmia requiring pacemaker inser tion in a 30 year old patients with paramyotonia congenital harbouring an S804F mutation in SCN4A.5 This is fur ther suppor ted by the fact that mutations in a closely related channel gene, SCN5A, cause long QT syndrome (LQT3) and that recent murine studies have demonstrated SCN4A expression in cardiac muscle.17 18 In contrast with original nor ther n blot analysis, SCN4A expression in human cardiac muscle has recently been confir med.19 20 This repor t expands the phenotypic variability of the T704M, fur ther confir ming the lack of genotype-phenotype cor relation in SCN4A mutations. A potassium channel gene such as KCNE3, in which mutations are a rare cause of hypokalaemic or hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis, is an example of a possible modifying gene.21 In conclusion, we have identified a family with hyperPP/ PMC caused by the T704M mutation in SCN4A. T704M can be considered a common cause of hyperPP/PMC and patients with this phenotype should be screened for this mutation in the first instance.

9395492	The enhanced activity of the heterologous expression of each of two active mutants, GIRK1(F137S) and GIRK4(S143T), was not caused by association with an endogenous oocyte channel subunit, and these mutants did not display apparent differences in the ability to localize to the cell surface compared with their wild-type counterparts. These experiments, which confirmed the crucial, in regulating channel though not exclusive, role of G activity, demonstrated that GIRK1(F137S) and GIRK4(S143T), and by extrapolation their wild-type counterparts, interact in a qualitatively similar way with G-protein subunits. We use here GIRK4(S143T) as well as the mutant GIRK1(F137S) to investigate the individual properties of each subunit of the GIRK channels, with particular attention to their regulation by G-protein subunits. 100 M GIRK1(F137S) and GIRK4(S143T) Generate Large ACh-sensitive Currents--Under our conditions, oocytes injected with cRNA for the wild-type GIRK1 or GIRK4 expressed basal and ACh-sensitive currents below 1 A at 80 mV which were somewhat larger than currents recorded from control oocytes (Fig. Using the same quantity of cRNA (2 ng), the single-point mutants GIRK1(F137S) and GIRK4(S143T) produced currents of a magnitude comparable to that of the wild-type heteromer (Fig. GIRK4(S143T) showed weaker rectification than GIRK1(F137S) which, like GIRK1-GIRK4, did not conduct any detectable outward currents under our conditions. One would therefore expect the homomeric GIRK1(F137S) and GIRK4(S143T) to have a reduced affinity for internal cations. Our observation that GIRK4(S143T) conducts small outward currents in oocytes, whereas GIRK1(F137S) and the heteromer GIRK1-GIRK4 do not, suggests that, first, the presence of a negative charge at positions 173/179 may be a stronger determinant of rectification than that at positions 225/231, and second, the strong rectification phenotype of GIRK1 may be dominant in the wild-type heteromer. Large inwardly rectifying currents recorded from Xenopus oocytes expressing GIRK1(F137S) or GIRK4(S143T). Oocytes were injected with cRNA coding for muscarinic receptor and, from top to bottom, GIRK1, GIRK4, GIRK1 and GIRK4, GIRK1(F137S), or GIRK4 (S143T). In our hands, both mutants (GIRK1(F137S) and GIRK4(S143T)) produced large currents that reached a stationary level within milliseconds in response to steps from 0 to 80 mV (Fig. Could the observed activity of the GIRK P-region mutants arise from association with GIRK5? Let us consider GIRK4(S143T) first. 2 compares singlechannel activity of GIRK4, GIRK1-GIRK4, and GIRK4(S143T) expressed in Xenopus oocytes with their corresponding amplitude histograms. ( Expression of GIRK1(S143T) alone also resulted in enhanced levels of activity with distinct single-channel characteristics ( 7.3 0.8 pS, n 4; 2.1 0.4 ms, n 5). It is highly unlikely that the enhanced activity and the unique singlechannel characteristics of GIRK4(S143T) were the result of its association with the endogenous oocyte GIRK5 (or XIR) subunit. On one hand, increasing amounts of GIRK4(S143T) over relatively constant endogenous GIRK5 levels gave rise to increasing current levels with equivalent single-channel properties (data not shown). On the other hand, coexpression of GIRK4(S143T) with GIRK4, which may be functionally analogous to GIRK5 in its ability to produce enhanced currents in association with GIRK1 (9, 10), did not potentiate its activity (data not shown). Moreover, stable expression of GIRK4(S143T) in Chinese hamster ovary cells, which do not seem to express endogenous GIRK channels, yielded high levels of inwardly rectifying currents with distinct single-channel properties from similarly stably transfected cells with GIRK4 (data not shown). The unitary characteristics of the GIRK4(S143T) channel were not as long lived as those obtained from Xenopus oocytes and thus were difficult to characterize. Single-channel currents from representative cell-attached patches from Xenopus oocytes expressing GIRK4 (n 1 100 patches), GIRK1 and GIRK4 (n 00), and GIRK4(S143T) (n 11). Similar experiments were performed with the GIRK4(S143T) and GIRK1(F137S) channels as an assay to bring forth functional differences and highlight the relative contribution of each GIRK subunit to those interactions. Currents were recorded from oocytes expressing the wild-type heteromer, GIRK1-GIRK4 (panel A) or the mutant homomers GIRK4(S143T) (panel B) and GIRK1(F137S) (panel C). To reduce errors arising from batch-to-batch variability in level of expression, these values were normalized to the total current obtained in the presence of ACh under control conditions (the amplitude of total ACh current was on average 12.4, 12.0, and 4.2 A for GIRK1-GIRK4, GIRK4(S143T), and GIRK1(F137S), respectively). 6, coexpressed Gprotein subunits and PTX-S1 had comparable effects on basal and agonist-induced currents recorded from oocytes expressing either GIRK1-GIRK4, GIRK4(S143T), or GIRK1(F137S). 6 reveals that exogenous G 2 2 enhanced agonist-independent activity of GIRK4(S143T) 11fold but only 4-fold for GIRK1(F137S). Conversely, with G 2 2, GIRK1(F137S) current was increased 230% by ACh, whereas this figure was about 50% for GIRK4(S143T), suggesting that a GIRK1(F137S) may be more sensitive to receptor-released G nd less sensitive to exogenous G than GIRK4(S143T). Conclusions--The availability of functional mutants like GIRK4(S143T) and GIRK1(F137S) allows the study of properties of the individual subunits of heteromeric G-protein-gated channels and therefore of the contribution of each constituent subunit to the properties of the assembled channel. Both mutants had fast activation kinetics and rectified inwardly, although GIRK4(S143T) was a weaker rectifier than GIRK1(F137S). When tested with coexpressed receptor, G-protein subunits, and PTX-S1, both mutants behaved qualitatively similarly to the wild-type channel (although GIRK1(F137S) appeared more sensitive to receptor-activated G-proteins than GIRK4(S143T), perhaps because of better coupling with receptors).

The GIRK4(S143F) point mutant that was shown previously to be functionally silent and unable to cause current enhancement upon association with GIRK1 (10) exhibited a similar fluorescence signal at the cell surface. The enhanced activity of the heterologous expression of each of two active mutants, GIRK1(F137S) and GIRK4(S143T), was not caused by association with an endogenous oocyte channel subunit, and these mutants did not display apparent differences in the ability to localize to the cell surface compared with their wild-type counterparts.

If the GIRK1(F137S) activity were caused by its association with the endogenous oocyte GIRK5 subunit and if subunits associated more or less randomly in all possible combinations, one would expect less current when there is an excess of exogenous GIRK1(F137S) over a relatively constant background of endog2 enous GIRK5. Relation between amount of RNA injected and current for GIRK1 and GIRK1(F137S) and comparison of single-channel activities from oocytes injected with GIRK1(F137S) alone or together with GIRK5. All GIRK1(F137S) values were from the same batch of oocytes. B, single-channel records from an oocyte patch expressing exogenous GIRK1(F137S) (n 6). C, single-channel records from an oocyte patch coexpressing exogenous GIRK1(F137S) and GIRK5 (n 9). more GIRK1(F137S) RNA is used, more current is measured. Moreover, similar results were obtained when various concentrations of RNA (but not the entire range) from both GIRK1 and GIRK1(F137S) were tested in the same oocyte batch. As a more direct test of whether GIRK1(F137S) activity reflected its association with oocyte endogenous GIRK5 subunits, we compared single-channel activities from oocytes injected with GIRK1(F137S) mutants alone or together with exogenous GIRK5. 3B shows, as we have reported previously (10), expression of GIRK1(F137S) alone resulted in unique 15.4 0.9 pS, n 6) with single-channel conductance ( complex kinetics. In contrast, coinjection of GIRK1(F137S) with GIRK5 showed an additional distinct channel conduct39.3 0.92 pS, n 9), also with complex kinetics ance ( Active G-protein-gated Homomeric K C hannels 31557 FIG. Comparison of subcellular localization of wild-type GIRK channels with mutants GIRK1(F137S) and GIRK4(S143F). Top middle and right, representative sections of oocytes injected with GIRK1-GFP and GIRK1(F137S)-GFP RNA, respectively, showing a predominant cytoplasmic localization. Similar experiments of coinjection of GIRK1(F137S) with GIRK4 resulted also in channel activity displaying a dis37.9 0.94, n 15), in addition to that tinct conductance ( seen in oocytes injected with GIRK1(F137S) alone. These results provided direct evidence that expression of GIRK1(F137S) alone results in channel activity with unitary characteristics distinct from those resulting from association of GIRK1(F137S) with GIRK5 (or GIRK4). Thus, it is unlikely that the GIRK1(F137S) activity results from heteromerization with endogenous GIRK5. Expression of GIRK1(F137S)-GFP did not result in an increased cell surface signal. Similar experiments were performed with the GIRK4(S143T) and GIRK1(F137S) channels as an assay to bring forth functional differences and highlight the relative contribution of each GIRK subunit to those interactions. Currents were recorded from oocytes expressing the wild-type heteromer, GIRK1-GIRK4 (panel A) or the mutant homomers GIRK4(S143T) (panel B) and GIRK1(F137S) (panel C). To reduce errors arising from batch-to-batch variability in level of expression, these values were normalized to the total current obtained in the presence of ACh under control conditions (the amplitude of total ACh current was on average 12.4, 12.0, and 4.2 A for GIRK1-GIRK4, GIRK4(S143T), and GIRK1(F137S), respectively). 6, coexpressed Gprotein subunits and PTX-S1 had comparable effects on basal and agonist-induced currents recorded from oocytes expressing either GIRK1-GIRK4, GIRK4(S143T), or GIRK1(F137S). 6 reveals that exogenous G 2 2 enhanced agonist-independent activity of GIRK4(S143T) 11fold but only 4-fold for GIRK1(F137S). Conversely, with G 2 2, GIRK1(F137S) current was increased 230% by ACh, whereas this figure was about 50% for GIRK4(S143T), suggesting that a GIRK1(F137S) may be more sensitive to receptor-released G nd less sensitive to exogenous G than GIRK4(S143T). This could mean that GIRK1(F137S) is able to couple more intimately to receptors and might be more insulated from exogenous effectors. Conclusions--The availability of functional mutants like GIRK4(S143T) and GIRK1(F137S) allows the study of properties of the individual subunits of heteromeric G-protein-gated channels and therefore of the contribution of each constituent subunit to the properties of the assembled channel. Both mutants had fast activation kinetics and rectified inwardly, although GIRK4(S143T) was a weaker rectifier than GIRK1(F137S). When tested with coexpressed receptor, G-protein subunits, and PTX-S1, both mutants behaved qualitatively similarly to the wild-type channel (although GIRK1(F137S) appeared more sensitive to receptor-activated G-proteins than GIRK4(S143T), perhaps because of better coupling with receptors). 
12070264	1 of 2 ONLINE MUTATION REPORT Relationship between genotype and phenotype for the CFTR gene W846X mutation I Duguproux, G Bellis, C Frec, D Gillet, V Scotet, M de Braekeleer, and the participating centres of the French CF registry ............................................................................................................................. Wester n Brittany has one of the highest rates of CF in the world.1 2 Over 98% of the CF mutations in the Celtic population of Brittany have been identified.3 4 In this population, only five mutations account for 92.4% of the chromosomes: F508 81.2%, 1078delT 4.9%, G551D 4.1%, 1717-1GA 1.1%, and W846X2 1.1%. Most of the genotyping laboratories do not distinguish W846X15 and W846X26 mutations, which are located in the second transmembrane domain (exon 14a) and involve the substitution of a tr yptophan for a stop codon. W846X2 is the result of the change of a G to an A nucleotide at position 2670. Because of its high frequency and evidence of founder effect in Brittany (all CF chromosomes car r ying W846X2 share the same 16-32-13 microsatellites haplotype7), we decided to study the cor relation between the genotype and phenotype for this mutation. We extracted from the French CF Registr y all the patients who attended a par ticipating care centre at least once during 1999 and for whom the genotype was composed of the W846X and F508 mutations. Table 1 shows the phenotypic characteristics of the 10 CF patients compound heterozygous for the W846X and F508 mutations and the 10 F508 homozygous patients. No significant difference was found for the mean ages at the time of diagnosis despite wide variation owing to two late diagnoses in the W846X/F508 group: a male was diagnosed at 29 years old and a female at 27.4 years old. More F508 homozygotes than W846X/F508 patients were colonised with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the difference being borderline significant (p=0.057). The mean FEV1 and FCV values were much higher among the W846X/F508 patients (73.5 and 80.9% of the predicted values) than among the F508/F508 patients (53.9 and 68.9%); however, the differences were not significant. The better anthropometric and lung function results combined with a higher probability of reaching adulthood lead us to conclude that, although the W846X mutation should be considered a severe allele, it is associated with less severe pulmonar y manifestation and probably a better prognosis of the disease.
