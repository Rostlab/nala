8736554	The structure of elongation factor G in complex with GDP: conformational flexibility and nucleotide exchange.	BACKGROUND: Elongation factor G (EF-G) catalyzes the translocation step of translation. During translocation EF-G passes through four main conformational states: the GDP complex, the nucleotide-free state, the GTP complex, and the GTPase conformation. The first two of these conformations have been previously investigated by crystallographic methods. RESULTS: The structure of EF-G-GDP has been refined at 2.4 A resolution. Comparison with the nucleotide-free structure reveals that, upon GDP release, the phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) adopts a closed conformation. This affects the position of helix CG, the switch II loop and domains II, IV and V. Asp83 has a conformation similar to the conformation of the corresponding residue in the EF-Tu/EF-Ts complex. The magnesium ion is absent in EF-G-GDP. CONCLUSIONS: The results illustrate that conformational changes in the P-loop can be transmitted to other parts of the structure. A comparison of the structures of EF-G and EF-Tu suggests that EF-G, like EF-Tu, undergoes a transition with domain rearrangements. The conformation of EF-G-GDP around the nucleotide-binding site may be related to the mechanism of nucleotide exchange.
7520279	Crystal structures of wild-type p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase complexed with 4-aminobenzoate,2,4-dihydroxybenzoate, and 2-hydroxy-4-aminobenzoate and of the Tyr222Ala mutant complexed with 2-hydroxy-4-aminobenzoate. Evidence for a proton channel and a new binding mode of the flavin ring.	The crystal structures of wild-type p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase from Pseudomonas fluorescens, complexed with the substrate analogues 4-aminobenzoate, 2,4-dihydroxybenzoate, and 2-hydroxy-4-aminobenzoate have been determined at 2.3-, 2.5-, and 2.8-A resolution, respectively. In addition, the crystal structure of a Tyr222Ala mutant, complexed with 2-hydroxy-4-aminobenzoate, has been determined at 2.7-A resolution. The structures have been refined to R factors between 14.5% and 15.8% for data between 8.0 A and the high-resolution limit. The differences between these complexes and the wild-type enzyme-substrate complex are all concentrated in the active site region. Binding of substrate analogues bearing a 4-amino group (4-aminobenzoate and 2-hydroxy-4-aminobenzoate) leads to binding of a water molecule next to the active site Tyr385. As a result, a continuous hydrogen-bonding network is present between the 4-amino group of the substrate analogue and the side chain of His72. It is likely that this hydrogen-bonding network is transiently present during normal catalysis, where it may or may not function as a proton channel assisting the deprotonation of the 4-hydroxyl group of the normal substrate upon binding to the active site. Binding of substrate analogues bearing a hydroxyl group at the 2-position (2,4-dihydroxybenzoate and 2-hydroxy-4-aminobenzoate) leads to displacement of the flavin ring from the active site. The flavin is no longer in the active site (the "in" conformation) but is in the cleft leading to the active site instead (the "out" conformation). It is proposed that movement of the FAD out of the active site may provide an entrance for the substrate to enter the active site and an exit for the product to leave.
15663946	Structural and energetic consequences of mutations in a solvated hydrophobic cavity.	The structural and energetic consequences of modifications to the hydrophobic cavity of interleukin 1-beta (IL-1beta) are described. Previous reports demonstrated that the entirely hydrophobic cavity of IL-1beta contains positionally disordered water. To gain a better understanding of the nature of this cavity and the water therein, a number of mutant proteins were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis, designed to result in altered hydrophobicity of the cavity. These mutations involve the replacement of specific phenylalanine residues, which circumscribe the cavity, with tyrosine, tryptophan, leucine and isoleucine. Using differential scanning calorimetry to determine the relative stabilities of the wild-type and mutant proteins, we found all of the mutants to be destabilizing. X-ray crystallography was used to identify the structural consequences of the mutations. No clear correlation between the hydrophobicities of the specific side-chains introduced and the resulting stabilities was found.
10336378	Structural basis for the activity of two muconate cycloisomerase variants toward substituted muconates.	We have refined to 2.3 A resolution two muconate cycloisomerase (MCIase) variant structures, F329I and I54V, that differ from each other and from wild-type in their activity toward cis,cis-muconate (CCM) and substituted CCMs. The working and free R-factors for F329I are 17.4/21.6% and for I54V, 17.6/22.3% with good stereochemistry. Except for the mutated residue, there are no significant changes in structure. To understand the differences in enzymatic properties we docked substituted CCMs and CCM into the active sites of the variants and wild type. The extra space the mutations create appears to account for most of the enzymatic differences. The lack of other structural changes explains why, although structurally equivalent changes occur in chloromuconate cycloisomerase (CMCIase), the changes in themselves do not convert a MCIase into a dehalogenating CMCIase. Reanalysis of the CMCIase structure revealed only one general acid/base, K169. The structural implication is that, in 2-chloro-CCM conversion by CMCIase, the lactone ring of 5-chloromuconolactone rotates before dehalogenation to bring the acidic C4 proton next to K169. Therefore, K169 alone performs both required protonation and deprotonation steps, the first at C5 as in MCIase, and the second, after ring rotation, at C4. This distinguishes CMCIase from alpha/beta barrel isomerases and racemases, which use two different bases.
2143562	Three-dimensional structure of the ATPase fragment of a 70K heat-shock cognate protein.	The three-dimensional structure of the amino-terminal 44K ATPase fragment of the 70K bovine heat-shock cognate protein has been solved to a resolution of 2.2 A. The ATPase fragment has two structural lobes with a deep cleft between them; ATP binds at the base of the cleft. Surprisingly, the nucleotide-binding 'core' of the ATPase fragment has a tertiary structure similar to that of hexokinase, although the remainder of the structures of the two proteins are completely dissimilar, suggesting that both the phosphotransferase mechanism and the substrate-induced conformational change intrinsic to the hexokinases may be used by the 70K heat shock-related proteins.
14761185	Explorations of peptide and oligonucleotide binding sites of tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase using vanadate complexes.	Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase (Tdp1) catalyzes the hydrolysis of a phosphodiester bond between a tyrosine residue and a DNA 3' phosphate and functions as a DNA repair enzyme that cleaves stalled topoisomerase I-DNA complexes. We previously determined a procedure to crystallize a quaternary complex containing Tdp1, vanadate, a DNA oligonucleotide, and a tyrosine-containing peptide that mimics the transition state for hydrolysis of the Tdp1 substrate. Here, the ability of vanadate to accept a variety of different ligands is exploited to produce several different quaternary complexes with a variety of oligonucleotides, and peptides or a tyrosine analogue, in efforts to explore the binding properties of the Tdp1 DNA and peptide binding clefts. Eight crystal structures of Tdp1 with vanadate, oligonucleotides, and peptides or peptide analogues were determined. These structures demonstrated that Tdp1 is able to bind substituents with limited sequence variation in the polypeptide moiety and also bind oligonucleotides with sequence variation at the 3' end. Additionally, the tyrosine analogue octopamine can replace topoisomerase I derived peptides as the apical ligand to vanadate. The versatility of this system suggests that the formation of quaternary complexes around vanadate could be adapted to become a useful method for structure-based inhibitor design and has the potential to be generally applicable to other enzymes that perform chemistry on phosphate esters.
9730812	Crystal structure of the zinc-dependent beta-lactamase from Bacillus cereus at 1.9 A resolution: binuclear active site with features of a mononuclear enzyme.	The structure of the zinc-dependent beta-lactamase II from Bacillus cereus has been determined at 1.9 A resolution in a crystal form with two molecules in the asymmetric unit and 400 waters (space group P3121; Rcryst = 20.8%). The active site contains two zinc ions: Zn1 is tightly coordinated by His86, His88, and His149, while Zn2 is loosely coordinated by Asp90, Cys168, and His210. A water molecule (W1) lies between the two zinc ions but is significantly closer to Zn1 and at a distance of only 1.9 A is effectively a hydroxide moiety and a potential, preactivated nucleophile. In fact, Asp90 bridges W1 to Zn2, and its location is thus distinct from that of the bridging water molecules in the binuclear zinc peptidases or other binuclear zinc hydrolases. Modeling of penicillin, cephalosporin, and carbapenem binding shows that all are readily accommodated within the shallow active site cleft of the enzyme, and the Zn1-bound hydroxide is ideally located for nucleophilic attack at the beta-lactam carbonyl. This enzyme also functions with only one zinc ion present. The Zn1-Zn2 distances differ in the two independent molecules in the crystal (3.9 and 4.4 A), yet the Zn1-W1 distances are both 1.9 A, arguing against involvement of Zn2 in W1 activation. The role of Zn2 is unclear, but the B. cereus enzyme may be an evolutionary intermediate between the mono- and bizinc metallo-beta-lactamases. The broad specificity of this enzyme, together with the increasing prevalence of zinc-dependent metallo-beta-lactamases, poses a real clinical threat, and this structure provides a basis for understanding its mechanism and designing inhibitors.
11976494	The structure of L-rhamnulose-1-phosphate aldolase (class II) solved by low-resolution SIR phasing and 20-fold NCS averaging.	The enzyme L-rhamnulose-1-phosphate aldolase catalyzes the reversible cleavage of L-rhamnulose-1-phosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate and L-lactaldehyde. It is a homotetramer with an M(r) of 30 000 per subunit and crystallized in space group P3(2)21. The enzyme shows a low sequence identity of 18% with the structurally known L-fuculose-1-phosphate aldolase that splits a stereoisomer in a similar reaction. Structure analysis was initiated with a single heavy-atom derivative measured to 6 A resolution. The resulting poor electron density, a self-rotation function and the working hypothesis that both enzymes are C(4) symmetric with envelopes that resemble one another allowed the location of the 20 protomers of the asymmetric unit. The crystal-packing unit was a D(4)-symmetric propeller consisting of five D(4)-symmetric octamers around an internal crystallographic twofold axis. Presumably, the propellers associate laterally in layers, which in turn pile up along the 3(2) axis to form the crystal. The non-crystallographic symmetry was used to extend the phases to the 2.7 A resolution limit and to establish a refined atomic model of the enzyme. The structure showed that the two enzymes are indeed homologous and that they possess chemically similar active centres.
12176391	Gamma-adaptin appendage domain: structure and binding site for Eps15 and gamma-synergin.	The AP1 complex is one of a family of heterotetrameric clathrin-adaptor complexes involved in vesicular trafficking between the Golgi and endosomes. The complex has two large subunits, gamma and beta1, which can be divided into trunk, hinge, and appendage domains. The 1.8 A resolution structure of the gamma appendage is presented. The binding site for the known gamma appendage ligand gamma-synergin is mapped through creation of point mutations designed on the basis of the structure. We also show that Eps15, a protein believed to be involved in vesicle formation at the plasma membrane, is also a ligand of gamma appendage and binds to the same site as gamma-synergin. This observation explains the demonstrated brefeldinA (BFA)-sensitive colocalization of Eps15 and AP1 at the Golgi complex.
10469827	Experimental verification of the 'stability profile of mutant protein' (SPMP) data using mutant human lysozymes.	The stability profile of mutant protein (SPMP) (Ota,M., Kanaya,S. and Nishikawa,K., 1995, J. Mol. Biol., 248, 733-738) estimates the changes in conformational stability due to single amino acid substitutions using a pseudo-energy potential developed for evaluating structure-sequence compatibility in the structure prediction method, the 3D-1D compatibility evaluation. Nine mutant human lysozymes expected to significantly increase in stability from SPMP were constructed, in order to experimentally verify the reliability of SPMP. The thermodynamic parameters for denaturation and crystal structures of these mutant proteins were determined. One mutant protein was stabilized as expected, compared with the wild-type protein. However, the others were not stabilized even though the structural changes were subtle, indicating that SPMP overestimates the increase in stability or underestimates negative effects due to substitution. The stability changes in the other mutant human lysozymes previously reported were also analyzed by SPMP. The correlation of the stability changes between the experiment and prediction depended on the types of substitution: there were some correlations for proline mutants and cavity-creating mutants, but no correlation for mutants related to side-chain hydrogen bonds. The present results may indicate some additional factors that should be considered in the calculation of SPMP, suggesting that SPMP can be refined further.
11054294	Structure of a mutant EF-G reveals domain III and possibly the fusidic acid binding site.	The crystal structure of Thermus thermophilus elongation factor G (EF-G) carrying the point mutation His573Ala was determined at a resolution of 2.8 A. The mutant has a more closed structure than that previously reported for wild-type EF-G. This is obtained by a 10 degrees rigid rotation of domains III, IV and V with regard to domains I and II. This rotation results in a displacement of the tip of domain IV by approximately 9 A. The structure of domain III is now fully visible and reveals the double split beta-alpha-beta motif also observed for EF-G domain V and for several ribosomal proteins. A large number of fusidic acid resistant mutations found in domain III have now been possible to locate. Possible locations for the effector loop and a possible binding site for fusidic acid are discussed in relation to some of the fusidic acid resistant mutations.
10903932	Structural basis for chitin recognition by defense proteins: GlcNAc residues are bound in a multivalent fashion by extended binding sites in hevein domains.	BACKGROUND: Many plants respond to pathogenic attack by producing defense proteins that are capable of reversible binding to chitin, a polysaccharide present in the cell wall of fungi and the exoskeleton of insects. Most of these chitin-binding proteins include a common structural motif of 30 to 43 residues organized around a conserved four-disulfide core, known as the 'hevein domain' or 'chitin-binding' motif. Although a number of structural and thermodynamic studies on hevein-type domains have been reported, these studies do not clarify how chitin recognition is achieved. RESULTS: The specific interaction of hevein with several (GlcNAc)(n) oligomers has been studied using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), analytical ultracentrifugation and isothermal titration microcalorimetry (ITC). The data demonstrate that hevein binds (GlcNAc)(2-4) in 1:1 stoichiometry with millimolar affinity. In contrast, for (GlcNAc)(5), a significant increase in binding affinity is observed. Analytical ultracentrifugation studies on the hevein-(GlcNAc)(5,8) interaction allowed detection of protein-carbohydrate complexes with a ratio of 2:1 in solution. NMR structural studies on the hevein-(GlcNAc)(5) complex showed the existence of an extended binding site with at least five GlcNAc units directly involved in protein-sugar contacts. CONCLUSIONS: The first detailed structural model for the hevein-chitin complex is presented on the basis of the analysis of NMR data. The resulting model, in combination with ITC and analytical ultracentrifugation data, conclusively shows that recognition of chitin by hevein domains is a dynamic process, which is not exclusively restricted to the binding of the nonreducing end of the polymer as previously thought. This allows chitin to bind with high affinity to a variable number of protein molecules, depending on the polysaccharide chain length. The biological process is multivalent.
11018727	Dynamics of a mobile loop at the active site of Escherichia coli asparaginase.	Asparaginase II from Escherichia coli is well-known member of the bacterial class II amidohydrolases. Enzymes of this family utilize a peculiar catalytic mechanism in which a pair of threonine residues play pivotal roles. Another common feature is a mobile surface loop that closes over the active site when the substrates is bound. We have studied the motion of the loop by stopped-flow experiments using the fluorescence of tryptophan residues as the spectroscopic probe. With wild-type enzyme the fluorescence of the only tryptophan, W66, was monitored. Here asparagine induced a rapid closure of the loop. The rate constants of the process (100-150 s(-1) at 4 degrees C) were considerably higher than those of the rate-limiting catalytic step. A more selective spectroscopic probe was generated by replacing W66 with tyrosine and Y25, a component of the loop, with tryptophan. In the resulting enzyme variant, k(cat) and the rate of loop movement were reduced by factors of 10(2) and >10(3), respectively, while substrate binding was unaffected. This indicates that the presence of tyrosine in position 25 is essential for both loop closure and catalysis. Numerical simulations of the observed transients are consistent with a model where loop closure is an absolute prerequisite for substrate turnover.
2005130	Molecular structure of the toxin domain of heat-stable enterotoxin produced by a pathogenic strain of Escherichia coli. A putative binding site for a binding protein on rat intestinal epithelial cell membranes.	Heat-stable enterotoxins are a family of toxin peptides that are produced by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and consist of 18 and 19 amino acid residues (Aimoto, S., Takao, T., Shimonishi, Y., Hara, S., Takeda, T., Takeda, Y., and Miwatani, T. (1982) Eur. J. Biochem. 129, 257-263). A synthetic fully toxic analog of the enterotoxin, Mpr5-STp(5-17), where Mpr is beta-mercaptopropionic acid and which consists of 13 amino acid residues from Cys5 to Cys17 in a heat-stable enterotoxin but is deaminated at its N terminus (Kubota, H., Hidaka, Y., Ozaki, H., Ito, H., Hirayama, T., Takeda, Y., and Shimonishi, Y. (1989) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 161, 229-235), has been crystalized from water, and its crystal structure has been solved by a direct method and refined by least square procedures to give an R factor of 0.089. The crystal belongs to the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) with unit cell constants a = 21.010 (2) A, b = 27.621 (4) A, and c = 12.781 (1) A. The asymmetric unit of the crystals contains one peptide molecule with 13 water molecules. A right-hand spiral peptide backbone extends throughout the molecule. Three beta-turns are located along this spiral and fixed tightly by three intramolecular disulfide linkages. The actual structure predicts the biniding region on the enterotoxin to the receptor protein on the membrane of rat intestinal epithelial cells.
7922028	The high-resolution three-dimensional solution structures of the oxidized and reduced states of human thioredoxin.	BACKGROUND: Thioredoxin is a ubiquitous protein and is involved in a variety of fundamental biological functions. Its active site is conserved and has two redox active cysteines in the sequence Trp-Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys. No structures of the oxidized and reduced states from the same species have been determined at high resolution under the same conditions and using the same methods. Hence, any detailed comparison of the two oxidation states has been previously precluded. RESULTS: The reduced and oxidized states of the (C62A, C69A, C73A) mutant of human thioredoxin have been investigated by multidimensional heteronuclear NMR. Structures for both states were determined on the basis of approximately 28 experimental restraints per residue, and the resulting precision of the two structures is very high. Consequently, subtle differences between the oxidized and reduced states can be reliably assessed and evaluated. Small differences, particularly within and around the active site can be discerned. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the structures of the reduced and oxidized states of the (C62A, C69A, C73A) mutant of human thioredoxin are very similar (with a backbone atomic root mean square difference of about 0.9 A) and the packing of side chains within the protein core is nearly identical. The conformational change between oxidized and reduced human thioredoxin is very small and localized to areas in spatial proximity to the redox active cysteines. These subtle structural differences, in addition to the restriction of conformational freedom within the active site upon oxidation, may be important for the different activities of thioredoxin involving a variety of target proteins.
8652549	Modulation of a salt link does not affect binding of phosphate to its specific active transport receptor.	Electrostatic interactions are among the key forces determining the structure and function of proteins. These are exemplified in the liganded form of the receptor, a phosphate binding protein from Escherichia coli. The phosphate, completely dehydrated and buried in the receptor, is bound by 12 hydrogen bonds as well as a salt link with Arg 135. We have modulated the ionic attraction while preserving the hydrogen bonds by mutating Asp 137, also salt linked to Arg 135, to Asn, Gly or Thr. High-resolution crystallographic analysis revealed that Gly and Thr (but not Asn) mutant proteins have incorporated a more electronegative Cl- in place of the Asp carboxylate. That no dramatic effect on phosphate affinity was produced by these ionic perturbations indicates a major role for hydrogen bonds and other local dipoles in the binding and charge stabilization of ionic ligands.
11456890	The first solution structure of a paramagnetic copper(II) protein: the case of oxidized plastocyanin from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC6803.	The NMR solution structure of oxidized plastocyanin from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC6803 is here reported. The protein contains paramagnetic copper(II), whose electronic relaxation times are quite unfavorable for NMR solution studies. The structure has been solved on the basis of 1041 meaningful NOESY cross-peaks, 18 1D NOEs, 26 T(1) values, 96 dihedral angle constraints, and 18 H-bonds. The detection of broad hyperfine-shifted signals and their full assignment allowed the identification of the copper(II) ligands and the determination of the Cu-S-C-H dihedral angle for the coordinated cysteine. The global root-mean-square deviation from the mean structure for the solution structure family is 0.72 +/- 0.14 and 1.16 +/- 0.17 A for backbone and heavy atoms, respectively. The structure is overall quite satisfactory and represents a breakthrough, in that it includes paramagnetic copper proteins among the metalloproteins for which solution structures can be afforded. The comparison with the available X-ray structure of a triple mutant is also performed.
16275926	Structure and activity of the axon guidance protein MICAL.	During development, neurons are guided to their targets by short- and long-range attractive and repulsive cues. MICAL, a large multidomain protein, is required for the combined action of semaphorins and plexins in axon guidance. Here, we present the structure of the N-terminal region of MICAL (MICAL(fd)) determined by x-ray diffraction to 2.0 A resolution. The structure shows that MICAL(fd) is an FAD-containing module structurally similar to aromatic hydroxylases and amine oxidases. In addition, we present biochemical data that show that MICAL(fd) is a flavoenzyme that in the presence of NADPH reduces molecular oxygen to H(2)O(2) (K(m,NAPDH) = 222 microM; k(cat) = 77 sec(-1)), a molecule with known signaling properties. We propose that the H(2)O(2) produced by this reaction may be one of the signaling molecules involved in axon guidance by MICAL.
8646536	An engineered allosteric switch in leucine-zipper oligomerization.	Controversy remains about the role of core side-chain packing in specifying protein structure. To investigate the influence of core packing on the oligomeric structure of a coiled coil, we engineered a GCN4 leucine zipper mutant that switches from two to three strands upon binding the hydrophobic ligands cyclohexane and benzene. In solution these ligands increased the apparent thermal stability and the oligomerization order of the mutant leucine zipper. The crystal structure of the peptide-benzene complex shows a single benzene molecule bound at the engineered site in the core of the trimer. These results indicate that coiled coils are well-suited to function as molecular switches and emphasize that core packing is an important determinant of oligomerization specificity.
11563970	Crystal structure of the wild-type and D30A mutant thioredoxin h of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and implications for the catalytic mechanism.	Thioredoxins are ubiquitous proteins which catalyse the reduction of disulphide bridges on target proteins. The catalytic mechanism proceeds via a mixed disulphide intermediate whose breakdown should be enhanced by the involvement of a conserved buried residue, Asp-30, as a base catalyst towards residue Cys-39. We report here the crystal structure of wild-type and D30A mutant thioredoxin h from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which constitutes the first crystal structure of a cytosolic thioredoxin isolated from a eukaryotic plant organism. The role of residue Asp-30 in catalysis has been revisited since the distance between the carboxylate OD1 of Asp-30 and the sulphur SG of Cys-39 is too great to support the hypothesis of direct proton transfer. A careful analysis of all available crystal structures reveals that the relative positioning of residues Asp-30 and Cys-39 as well as hydrophobic contacts in the vicinity of residue Asp-30 do not allow a conformational change sufficient to bring the two residues close enough for a direct proton transfer. This suggests that protonation/deprotonation of Cys-39 should be mediated by a water molecule. Molecular-dynamics simulations, carried out either in vacuo or in water, as well as proton-inventory experiments, support this hypothesis. The results are discussed with respect to biochemical and structural data.
3035380	Myristylation of picornavirus capsid protein VP4 and its structural significance.	We have obtained evidence that poliovirus and other picornavirus particles are specifically modified by having myristic acid covalently bound to a capsid protein. The electron density map of poliovirus confirms the position of the myristate molecule and defines its location in the virus particle. Analogies with other myristylated proteins suggest that the myristate moiety in picornaviruses may be involved in capsid assembly or in the entry of virus into cells.
8471602	Structure of the cobalt-dependent methionine aminopeptidase from Escherichia coli: a new type of proteolytic enzyme.	The X-ray structure of Escherichia coli methionine aminopeptidase (MAP) has been determined to 2.4-A resolution and refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 18.2%. The fold is novel and displays internal pseudo-2-fold symmetry which structurally relates the first and second halves of the polypeptide chain. The topology consists of a central antiparallel beta-sheet covered on one side by two pairs of alpha-helices and by a C-terminal loop. The other face of the beta-sheet, together with some irregular loops, forms the active site, which contains two cobalt ions 2.9 A apart. These metal ions are liganded by the side chains of Asp 97, Asp 108, Glu 204, Glu 235, and His 171 with approximate octahedral coordination. In terms of both the novel backbone fold and the constitution of the active site, MAP appears to represent a new class of proteolytic enzyme.
14990731	Crystal structures of a multidrug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease reveal an expanded active-site cavity.	The goal of this study was to use X-ray crystallography to investigate the structural basis of resistance to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitors. We overexpressed, purified, and crystallized a multidrug-resistant (MDR) HIV-1 protease enzyme derived from a patient failing on several protease inhibitor-containing regimens. This HIV-1 variant contained codon mutations at positions 10, 36, 46, 54, 63, 71, 82, 84, and 90 that confer drug resistance to protease inhibitors. The 1.8-angstrom (A) crystal structure of this MDR patient isolate reveals an expanded active-site cavity. The active-site expansion includes position 82 and 84 mutations due to the alterations in the amino acid side chains from longer to shorter (e.g., V82A and I84V). The MDR isolate 769 protease "flaps" stay open wider, and the difference in the flap tip distances in the MDR 769 variant is 12 A. The MDR 769 protease crystal complexes with lopinavir and DMP450 reveal completely different binding modes. The network of interactions between the ligands and the MDR 769 protease is completely different from that seen with the wild-type protease-ligand complexes. The water molecule-forming hydrogen bonds bridging between the two flaps and either the substrate or the peptide-based inhibitor are lacking in the MDR 769 clinical isolate. The S1, S1', S3, and S3' pockets show expansion and conformational change. Surface plasmon resonance measurements with the MDR 769 protease indicate higher k(off) rates, resulting in a change of binding affinity. Surface plasmon resonance measurements provide k(on) and k(off) data (K(d) = k(off)/k(on)) to measure binding of the multidrug-resistant protease to various ligands. This MDR 769 protease represents a new antiviral target, presenting the possibility of designing novel inhibitors with activity against the open and expanded protease forms.
8401227	Use of proline mutants to help solve the NMR solution structure of type III antifreeze protein.	To help understand the structure/function relationships in antifreeze proteins (AFP), and to define the motifs required for ice binding, a Type III AFP suitable for two-dimensional (2D) NMR studies was produced in Escherichia coli. A synthetic gene for one of the Type III AFP isoforms was assembled in a T7 polymerase-directed expression vector. The 67-amino acid-long gene product differed from the natural AFP by inclusion of an N-terminal methionine but was indistinguishable in activity. The NMR spectra of this AFP were complicated by cis-trans proline isomerization from the C-terminal sequence YPPA. Substitution of this sequence by YAA eliminated isomer signals without altering the activity or structure of the mutant AFP. This variant (rQAE m1.1) was selected for sequential assignment and the secondary structure determination using 2D 1H NMR spectroscopy. Nine beta-strands are paired to form two triple-stranded antiparallel sheets and one double-stranded antiparallel sheet. Two further proline replacements, P29A and P33A, were made to delineate the role of conserved prolines in Type III AFP. These mutants were valuable in clarifying ambiguous NMR spectral assignments amongst the remaining six prolines of rQAE m1.1. In contrast to the replacement of the C-terminal prolyl residues, the exchange of P29 and P33 caused some structural changes and significantly decreased protein solubility and antifreeze activity.
15477100	Crystallographic studies of ligand binding by Zn-alpha2-glycoprotein.	Zn-alpha2-glycoprotein (ZAG) is a 41 kDa soluble protein that is present in most bodily fluids. The previously reported 2.8 A crystal structure of ZAG isolated from human serum demonstrated the structural similarity between ZAG and class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and revealed a non-peptidic ligand in the ZAG counterpart of the MHC peptide-binding groove. Here we present crystallographic studies to explore further the nature of the non-peptidic ligand in the ZAG groove. Comparison of the structures of several forms of recombinant ZAG, including a 1.95 A structure derived from ZAG expressed in insect cells, suggests that the non-peptidic ligand in the current structures and in the structure of serum ZAG is a polyethylene glycol (PEG), which is present in the crystallization conditions used. Further support for PEG binding in the ZAG groove is provided by the finding that PEG displaces a fluorophore-tagged fatty acid from the ZAG binding site. From these results we hypothesize that our purified forms of ZAG do not contain a bound endogenous ligand, but that the ZAG groove is capable of binding hydrophobic molecules, which may relate to its function.
1433293	Structure of native and apo carbonic anhydrase II and structure of some of its anion-ligand complexes.	In order to obtain a better structural framework for understanding the catalytic mechanism of carbonic anhydrase, a number of inhibitor complexes of the enzyme were investigated crystallographically. The three-dimensional structure of free human carbonic anhydrase II was refined at pH 7.8 (1.54 A resolution) and at pH 6.0 (1.67 A resolution). The structure around the zinc ion was identical at both pH values. The structure of the zinc-free enzyme was virtually identical with that of the native enzyme, apart from a water molecule that had moved 0.9 A to fill the space that would be occupied by the zinc ion. The complexes with the anionic inhibitors bisulfite and formate were also studied at neutral pH. Bisulfite binds with one of its oxygen atoms, presumably protonized, to the zinc ion and replaces the zinc water. Formate, lacking a hydroxyl group, is bound with its oxygen atoms not far away from the position of the non-protonized oxygen atoms of the bisulfite complex, i.e. at hydrogen bond distance from Thr199 N and at a position between the zinc ion and the hydrophobic part of the active site. The result of these and other studies have implications for our view of the catalytic function of the enzyme, since virtually all inhibitors share some features with substrate, product or expected transition states. A reaction scheme where electrophilic activation of carbon dioxide plays an important role in the hydration reaction is presented. In the reverse direction, the protonized oxygen of the bicarbonate is forced upon the zinc ion, thereby facilitating cleavage of the carbon-oxygen bond. This is achieved by the combined action of the anionic binding site, which binds carboxyl groups, the side-chain of threonine 199, which discriminates between hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and hydrophobic interaction between substrate and the active site cavity. The required proton transfer between the zinc water and His64 can take place through water molecules 292 and 318.
16150974	Hydrogen bonding in human manganese superoxide dismutase containing 3-fluorotyrosine.	Incorporation of 3-fluorotyrosine and site-specific mutagenesis has been utilized with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography to elucidate active-site structure and the role of an active-site residue Tyr34 in human manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). Calculated harmonic frequencies at the B3LYP/6-31G** level of theory for L-tyrosine and its 3-fluorine substituted analog are compared to experimental frequencies for vibrational mode assignments. Each of the nine tyrosine residues in each of the four subunits of the homotetramer of human MnSOD was replaced with 3-fluorotyrosine. The crystal structures of the unfluorinated and fluorinated wild-type MnSOD are nearly superimposable with the root mean-square deviation for 198 alpha-carbon atoms at 0.3 A. The FTIR data show distinct vibrational modes arising from 3-fluorotyrosine in MnSOD. Comparison of spectra for wild-type and Y34F MnSOD showed that the phenolic hydroxyl of Tyr34 is hydrogen bonded, acting as a proton donor in the active site. Comparison with crystal structures demonstrates that the hydroxyl of Tyr34 is a hydrogen bond donor to an adjacent water molecule; this confirms the participation of Tyr34 in a network of residues and water molecules that extends from the active site to the adjacent subunit.
9374866	Mapping the binding site for matrix metalloproteinase on the N-terminal domain of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 by NMR chemical shift perturbation.	Changes in the NMR chemical shift of backbone amide nuclei (1H and 15N) have been used to map the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) binding site on the N-terminal domain of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (N-TIMP-2). Amide chemical shift changes were measured on formation of a stable complex with the catalytic domain of stromelysin-1 (N-MMP-3). Residues with significantly shifted amide signals mapped specifically to a broad site covering one face of the molecule. This site (the MMP binding site) consists primarily of residues 1-11, 27-41, 68-73, 87-90, and 97-104. The site overlaps with the OB-fold binding site seen in other proteins that share the same five-stranded beta-barrel topology. Sequence conservation data and recent site-directed mutagenesis studies are discussed in relation to the MMP binding site identified in this work.
15657928	Ybiv from Escherichia coli K12 is a HAD phosphatase.	The protein YbiV from Escherichia coli K12 MG1655 is a hypothetical protein with sequence homology to the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of proteins. Although numerous members of this family have been identified, the functions of few are known. Using the crystal structure, sequence analysis, and biochemical assays, we have characterized YbiV as a HAD phosphatase. The crystal structure of YbiV reveals a two-domain protein, one with the characteristic HAD hydrolase fold, the other an inserted alpha/beta fold. In an effort to understand the mechanism, we also solved and report the structures of YbiV in complex with beryllofluoride (BeF3-) and aluminum trifluoride (AlF3), which have been shown to mimic the phosphorylated intermediate and transition state for hydrolysis, respectively, in analogy to other HAD phosphatases. Analysis of the structures reveals the substrate-binding cavity, which is hydrophilic in nature. Both structure and sequence homology indicate YbiV may be a sugar phosphatase, which is supported by biochemical assays that measured the release of free phosphate on a number of sugar-like substrates. We also investigated available genomic and functional data in an effort to determine the physiological substrate.
10387041	Molecular recognition of macrocyclic peptidomimetic inhibitors by HIV-1 protease.	High-resolution crystal structures are described for seven macrocycles complexed with HIV-1 protease (HIVPR). The macrocycles possess two amides and an aromatic group within 15-17 membered rings designed to replace N- or C-terminal tripeptides from peptidic inhibitors of HIVPR. Appended to each macrocycle is a transition state isostere and either an acyclic peptide, nonpeptide, or another macrocycle. These cyclic analogues are potent inhibitors of HIVPR, and the crystal structures show them to be structural mimics of acyclic peptides, binding in the active site of HIVPR via the same interactions. Each macrocycle is restrained to adopt a beta-strand conformation which is preorganized for protease binding. An unusual feature of the binding of C-terminal macrocyclic inhibitors is the interaction between a positively charged secondary amine and a catalytic aspartate of HIVPR. A bicyclic inhibitor binds similarly through its secondary amine that lies between its component N-terminal and C-terminal macrocycles. In contrast, the corresponding tertiary amine of the N-terminal macrocycles does not interact with the catalytic aspartates. The amine-aspartate interaction induces a 1.5 A N-terminal translation of the inhibitors in the active site and is accompanied by weakened interactions with a water molecule that bridges the ligand to the enzyme, as well as static disorder in enzyme flap residues. This flexibility may facilitate peptide cleavage and product dissociation during catalysis. Proteases [Aba67,95]HIVPR and [Lys7,Ile33,Aba67,95]HIVPR used in this work were shown to have very similar crystal structures.
1731252	A cavity-containing mutant of T4 lysozyme is stabilized by buried benzene.	The hydrophobic cores of proteins are generally well packed, with few cavities. Mutations in which a bulky buried residue such as leucine or phenylalanine is replaced with a small residue such as alanine can create cavities in the core of a protein (our unpublished results). The sizes and shapes of such cavities can vary substantially depending on factors such as local geometry, whether or not a cavity already exists at the site of substitution, and the degree to which the protein structure relaxes to occupy the space vacated by the substituted residue. We show by crystallographic and thermodynamic analysis that the cavity created by the replacement Leu 99----Ala in T4 lysozyme is large enough to bind benzene and that ligand binding increases the melting temperature of the protein by 6.0 degrees C at pH 3.0. Benzene does not, however, bind to the cavity created by the Phe 153----Ala replacement. The results show that cavities can be engineered in proteins and suggest that such cavities might be tailored to bind specific ligands. The binding of benzene at an internal site 7 A from the molecular surface also illustrates the dynamic nature of proteins, even in crystals.
9331416	The structure of an essential splicing element: stem loop IIa from yeast U2 snRNA.	BACKGROUND: Eukaryotic genes are usually transcribed as precursor mRNAs which are then spliced, removing introns to produce functional mRNAs. Splicing is performed by the spliceosome and provides an important level of post-translational control of gene expression. Stem loop IIa from U2 small nuclear (sn)RNA is required for the efficient association of the U2 small nuclear ribonuclear protein (snRNP) with the nascent spliceosome in yeast. Genetic analysis suggests that stem loop IIa is involved in RNA-protein interactions early in splicing, and it may also interact with other RNA sequences in U2. The sequence of loop IIa is well conserved, consistent with the idea that this loop is important for function. RESULTS: We have solved the structure of U2A, a 20-base analogue of stem loop IIa from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using NMR and restrained molecular dynamics. In the process, we have demonstrated the efficacy of a new structure calculation protocol, torsion angle molecular dynamics. The structure that has emerged, which is consistent with the in vivo chemical protection data available for stem loop IIa in the context of intact U2 snRNA, contains a sheared GA pair followed by a U-turn in the loop. The U-turn conformation, which resembles the U-turns in tRNA anticodon loops, makes this stretch of U2 snRNA an obvious target for interactions with proteins and/or other RNA sequences. CONCLUSIONS: The phenotypes of many stem loop IIa mutants can be rationalized assuming that the U-turn conformation in the loop must be preserved for efficient splicing. This observation, combined with the phylogenetic conservation of its sequence, suggests that the conformation of the loop of stem loop IIa is essential for its function in pre-mRNA splicing.
2916125	Control of enzyme activity by an engineered disulfide bond.	A novel approach to the control of enzyme catalysis is presented in which a disulfide bond engineered into the active-site cleft of bacteriophage T4 lysozyme is capable of switching the activity on and off. Two cysteines (Thr21----Cys and Thr142----Cys) were introduced by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis into the active-site cleft. These cysteines spontaneously formed a disulfide bond under oxidative conditions in vitro, and the catalytic activity of the oxidized (cross-linked) T4 lysozyme was completely lost. On exposure to reducing agent, however, the disulfide bond was rapidly broken, and the reduced (non-cross-linked) lysozyme was restored to full activity. Thus an enzyme has been engineered such that redox potential can be used to control catalytic activity.
16459338	Stabilization of the autoproteolysis of TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE) results in a novel crystal form suitable for structure-based drug design studies.	The crystallization of TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE) has been useful in understanding the structure-activity relationships of new chemical entities. However, the propensity of TACE to undergo autoproteolysis has made enzyme handling difficult and impeded the identification of inhibitor soakable crystal forms. The autoproteolysis of TACE was found to be specific (Y352-V353) and occurred within a flexible loop that is in close proximity to the P-side of the active site. The rate of autoproteolysis was found to be proportional to the concentration of TACE, suggesting a bimolecular reaction mechanism. A limited specificity study of the S(1)' subsite was conducted using surrogate peptides and suggested substitutions that would stabilize the proteolysis of the loop at positions Y352-V353. Two mutant proteases (V353G and V353S) were generated and proved to be highly resistant to autoproteolysis. The kinetics of the more resistant mutant (V353G) and wild-type TACE were compared and demonstrated virtually identical IC(50) values for a panel of competitive inhibitors. However, the k(cat)/K(m) of the mutant for a larger substrate (P6 - P(6)') was approximately 5-fold lower than that for the wild-type enzyme. Comparison of the complexed wild-type and mutant structures indicated a subtle shift in a peripheral P-side loop (comprising the mutation site) that may be involved in substrate binding/turnover and might explain the mild kinetic difference. The characterization of this stabilized form of TACE has yielded an enzyme with similar native kinetic properties and identified a novel crystal form that is suitable for inhibitor soaking and structure determination.
2261478	Structure and oxidation-reduction behavior of 1-deaza-FMN flavodoxins: modulation of redox potentials in flavodoxins.	Flavodoxins from Clostridium beijerinckii and from Megasphaera elsdenii with 1-carba-1-deaza-FMN substituted for FMN have been used to study flavin-protein interactions in flavodoxins. The oxidized 1-deaza analogue of FMN binds to apoflavodoxins from M. elsdenii and C. beijerinckii (a.k.a. Clostridium MP) with association constants (Ka) of 1.0 x 10(7) M-1 and 3.1 x 10(6) M-1, values about 10(2) less than the corresponding Ka values for FMN. X-ray structure analysis of oxidized 1-deaza-FMN flavodoxin from C. beijerinckii at 2.5-A resolution shows that the analogue binds with the flavin atoms in the same locations as their equivalents in FMN but that the protein moves in the vicinity of Gly 89 to accommodate the 1-CH group, undergoing displacements which increase the distance between position 1 of the flavin ring and the main-chain atoms of Gly 89 and move the peptide hydrogen of Gly 89 by about 0.6 A. The X-ray analysis implies that protonation of normal flavin at N(1), as would occur in formation of the neutral fully reduced species, would result in a similar structural perturbation. The oxidation-reduction potentials of 1-deaza-FMN flavodoxin from M. elsdenii have been determined in the pH range 4.5-9.2. The oxidized/semiquinone equilibrium (E'0 = -160 mV at pH 7.0) displays a pH dependence of -60 mV per pH unit; the semiquinone/reduced equilibrium (E'0 = -400 mV at pH 7.0) displays a pH dependence of -60 mV per pH unit at low pH and is pH independent at high pH, with a redox-linked pK of 7.4. Spectral changes of fully reduced 1-deaza-FMN flavodoxin with pH suggest that this latter pK corresponds to protonation of the flavin ring system (the pK of free reduced 1-deaza-FMN is 5.6 [Spencer, R., Fisher, J., & Walsh, C. (1977) Biochemistry 16, 3586-3593]. The pK of reduced 1-deaza-FMN flavodoxin provides an estimate of the electrostatic interaction between the protein and the bound prosthetic group; the free energy of binding neutral reduced 1-deaza-FMN is more negative than that for binding the anionic reduced 1-deaza-FMN by 2.4 kcal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
9499107	Mutations in a conserved residue in the influenza virus neuraminidase active site decreases sensitivity to Neu5Ac2en-derived inhibitors.	The influenza virus neuraminidase (NA)-specific inhibitor zanamivir (4-guanidino-Neu5Ac2en) is effective in humans when administered topically within the respiratory tract. The search for compounds with altered pharmacological properties has led to the identification of a novel series of influenza virus NA inhibitors in which the triol group of zanamivir has been replaced by a hydrophobic group linked by a carboxamide at the 6 position (6-carboxamide). NWS/G70C variants generated in vitro, with decreased sensitivity to 6-carboxamide, contained hemagglutinin (HA) and/or NA mutations. HA mutants bound with a decreased efficiency to the cellular receptor and were cross-resistant to all the NA inhibitors tested. The NA mutation, an Arg-to-Lys mutation, was in a previously conserved site, Arg292, which forms part of a triarginyl cluster in the catalytic site. In enzyme assays, the NA was equally resistant to zanamivir and 4-amino-Neu5Ac2en but showed greater resistance to 6-carboxamide and was most resistant to a new carbocyclic NA inhibitor, GS4071, which also has a hydrophobic side chain at the 6 position. Consistent with enzyme assays, the lowest resistance in cell culture was seen to zanamivir, more resistance was seen to 6-carboxamide, and the greatest resistance was seen to GS4071. Substrate binding and enzyme activity were also decreased in the mutant, and consequently, virus replication in both plaque assays and liquid culture was compromised. Altered binding of the hydrophobic side chain at the 6 position or the triol group could account for the decreased binding of both the NA inhibitors and substrate.
15147186	Structural, kinetic, and mutational studies of the zinc ion environment in tetrameric cytidine deaminase.	The zinc-containing cytidine deaminase (CDA, EC 3.5.4.5) is a pyrimidine salvage enzyme catalyzing the hydrolytic deamination of cytidine and 2'-deoxycytidine forming uridine and 2'-deoxyuridine, respectively. Homodimeric CDA (D-CDA) and homotetrameric CDA (T-CDA) both contain one zinc ion per subunit coordinated to the catalytic water molecule. The zinc ligands in D-CDA are one histidine and two cysteine residues, whereas in T-CDA zinc is coordinated to three cysteines. Two of the zinc coordinating cysteines in T-CDA form hydrogen bonds to the conserved residue Arg56, and this residue together with the dipole moments from two alpha-helices partially neutralizes the additional negative charge in the active site, leading to a catalytic activity similar to D-CDA. Arg56 has been substituted by a glutamine (R56Q), the corresponding residue in D-CDA, an alanine (R56A), and an aspartate (R56D). Moreover, one of the zinc-liganding cysteines has been substituted by histidine to mimic D-CDA, alone (C53H) and in combination with R56Q (C53H/R56Q). R56A, R56Q, and C53H/R56Q contain the same amount of zinc as the wild-type enzyme. The zinc-binding capacity of R56D is reduced. Only R56A, R56Q, and C53H/R56Q yielded measurable CDA activity, R56A and R56Q with similar K(m) but decreased V(max) values compared to wild-type enzyme. Because of dissociation into its inactive subunits, it was impossible to determine the kinetic parameters for C53H/R56Q. R56A and C53H/R56Q display increased apparent pK(a) values compared to the wild-type enzyme and R56Q. On the basis of the structures of R56A, R56Q, and C53H/R56Q an explanation is provided of kinetic results and the apparent instability of C53H/R56Q.
15667209	Role of water in aging of human butyrylcholinesterase inhibited by echothiophate: the crystal structure suggests two alternative mechanisms of aging.	Organophosphorus poisons (OP) bind covalently to the active-site serine of cholinesterases. The inhibited enzyme can usually be reactivated with powerful nucleophiles such as oximes. However, the covalently bound OP can undergo a suicide reaction (termed aging) yielding nonreactivatable enzyme. In human butyrylcholinesterase (hBChE), aging involves the residues His438 and Glu197 that are proximal to the active-site serine (Ser198). The mechanism of aging is known in detail for the nerve gases soman, sarin, and tabun as well as the pesticide metabolite isomalathion. Aging of soman- and sarin-inhibited acetylcholinesterase occurs by C-O bond cleavage, whereas that of tabun- and isomalathion-inhibited acetylcholinesterase occurs by P-N and P-S bond cleavage, respectively. In this work, the crystal structures of hBChE inhibited by the ophthalmic reagents echothiophate (nonaged and aged) and diisopropylfluorophosphate (aged) were solved and refined to 2.1, 2.25, and 2.2 A resolution, respectively. No appreciable shift in the position of the catalytic triad histidine was observed between the aged and nonaged conjugates of hBChE. This absence of shift contrasts with the aged and nonaged crystal structures of Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase inhibited by the nerve agent VX. The nonaged hBChE structure shows one water molecule interacting with Glu197 and the catalytic triad histidine (His438). Interestingly, this water molecule is ideally positioned to promote aging by two mechanisms: breaking either a C-O bond or a P-O bond. Pesticides and certain stereoisomers of nerve agents are expected to undergo aging by breaking the P-O bond.
11993994	The structure of a mutant photosynthetic reaction center shows unexpected changes in main chain orientations and quinone position.	We report on the unexpected structural changes caused by substitution of acidic amino acids in the Q(B) binding pocket of the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center by alanines. The mutations targeted key residues L212Glu and L213Asp of this transmembrane protein-cofactor complex. The amino acid substitutions in the L212Ala-L213Ala mutant reaction center ("AA") were known to affect the delivery of protons after the light-induced generation of Q(B)(-), which renders the AA strain incapable of photosynthetic growth. The AA structure not only revealed side chain rearrangements but also showed movement of the main chain segments that are contiguous with the mutation sites. The alanine substitutions caused an expansion of the cavity rather than its collapse. In addition, Q(B) is found mainly in the binding site that is proximal to the iron-ligand complex (closest to Q(A)) as opposed to its distal binding site (furthest from Q(A)) in the structure of the wild-type reaction center. The observed rearrangements in the structure of the AA reaction center establish a new balance between charged residues of an interactive network near Q(B). This structurally and electrostatically altered complex forms the basis for future understanding of the structural basis for proton transfer in active reaction centers which retain the alanine substitutions but carry a distant compensatory mutation.
8869640	An engineered Staphylococcus aureus PC1 beta-lactamase that hydrolyses third-generation cephalosporins.	The beta-lactamase from Staphylococcus aureus PC1 has been cloned into an Escherichia coli vector for site-directed mutagenesis and high-level protein expression. A mutant enzyme has been produced in which Ala238 is replaced by a serine, and Ile239 is deleted (A238S:I239del). The engineered enzyme hydrolyses third-generation cephalosporins substantially more rapidly than the parental enzyme does, while hydrolysis of benzylpenicillin is slower with the mutant than with the wild-type and native enzymes. The mutant beta-lactamase has been crystallized and the structure determined and refined at 2.8 A resolution. The disposition of the beta-strand which forms the side of the active site is altered in comparison with the native S. aureus beta-lactamase structure, widening the active site cleft and providing space to accommodate the bulky side-chains of the third-generation cephalosporins.
15095972	Crystal structures of HIV-1 reverse transcriptases mutated at codons 100, 106 and 108 and mechanisms of resistance to non-nucleoside inhibitors.	Leu100Ile, Val106Ala and Val108Ile are mutations in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) that are observed in the clinic and give rise to resistance to certain non-nucleoside inhibitors (NNRTIs) including the first-generation drug nevirapine. In order to investigate structural mechanisms of resistance for different NNRTI classes we have determined six crystal structures of mutant RT-inhibitor complexes. Val108 does not have direct contact with nevirapine in wild-type RT and in the RT(Val108Ile) complex the biggest change observed is at the distally positioned Tyr181 which is > 8 A from the mutation site. Thus in contrast to most NNRTI resistance mutations RT(Val108Ile) appears to act via an indirect mechanism which in this case is through alterations of the ring stacking interactions of the drug particularly with Tyr181. Shifts in side-chain and inhibitor positions compared to wild-type RT are observed in complexes of nevirapine and the second-generation NNRTI UC-781 with RT(Leu100Ile) and RT(Val106Ala), leading to perturbations in inhibitor contacts with Tyr181 and Tyr188. Such perturbations are likely to be a factor contributing to the greater loss of binding for nevirapine compared to UC-781 as, in the former case, a larger proportion of binding energy is derived from aromatic ring stacking of the inhibitor with the tyrosine side-chains. The differing resistance profiles of first and second generation NNRTIs for other drug resistance mutations in RT may also be in part due to this indirect mechanism.
7634071	Parallel evolution in two homologues of phosphorylase.	The structure of the unphosphorylated, inactive form of yeast glycogen phosphorylase has been determined to a resolution of 2.6 A. The structure is similar to the phosphorylated, active form of muscle phosphorylase in the orientations of the subunits and catalytic residues, but resembles the inactive muscle enzyme in the closed, or substrate excluding, orientation of the two domains. Part of the unique yeast amino-terminal extension of 40 residues binds near the catalytic site of the second subunit in the homodimer, preventing the domain movement required for substrate access. Phosphorylation may displace the amino terminus from the active site, allowing the domains to separate.
2544734	Three-dimensional structures of drug-resistant mutants of human rhinovirus 14.	Mutants of human rhinovirus 14 were isolated and characterized by searching for resistance to compounds that inhibit viral uncoating. The portions of the RNA that code for amino acids that surround the antiviral compound binding site were sequenced. X-ray analysis of two of these mutants, 1188 Val----Leu and 1199 Cys----Tyr, shows that these were single-site substitutions which would sterically hinder drug binding. Differences in the resistance of mutant viruses to various antiviral compounds may be rationalized in terms of the three-dimensional structures of these mutants. Predictions of the structures of mutant rhinovirus 14 with the substitutions 1188 Val----Leu, 1199 Cys----Tyr and 1199 Cys----Trp in VP1 were made using a molecular dynamics technique. The predicted structure of the 1199 Cys----Tyr mutant was consistent with the electron density map, while the 1188 Val----Leu prediction was not. Large (up to 1.4 A) conformational differences between native rhinovirus 14 and the 1199 Cys----Tyr mutant occurred in main-chain atoms near the mutation site. These changes, as well as the orientation of the 1199 tyrosine side-chain, were correctly predicted by the molecular dynamics calculation. The structure of the predicted 1199 Cys----Trp mutation is consistent with the drug-resistant properties of this virus.
2179047	Characterization and nucleotide sequence of the cryptic cel operon of Escherichia coli K12.	Wild-type Escherichia coli are not able to utilize beta-glucoside sugars because the genes for utilization of these sugars are cryptic. Spontaneous mutations in the cel operon allow its expression and enable the organism to ferment cellobiose, arbutin and salicin. In this report we describe the structure and nucleotide sequence of the cel operon. The cel operon consists of five genes: celA, whose function is unknown; celB and celC which encode phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system enzyme IIcel and enzyme IIIcel, respectively, for the transport and phosphorylation of beta-glucoside sugars; celD, which encodes a negative regulatory protein; and celF, which encodes a phospho-beta-glucosidase that acts on phosphorylated cellobiose, arbutin and salicin. The mutationally activated cel operon is induced in the presence of its substrates, and is repressed in their absence. A comparison of proteins encoded by the cel operon with functionally equivalent proteins of the bgl operon, another cryptic E. coli gene system responsible for the catabolism of beta-glucoside sugars, revealed no significant homology between these two systems despite common functional characteristics. The celD and celF encoded repressor and phospho-beta-glucosidase proteins are homologous to the melibiose regulatory protein and to the melA encoded alpha-galactosidase of E. coli, respectively. Furthermore, the celC encoded PEP-dependent phosphotransferase system enzyme IIIcel is strikingly homologous to an enzyme IIIlac of the Gram-positive organism Staphylococcus aureus. We conclude that the genes for these two enzyme IIIs diverged much more recently than did their hosts, indicating that E. coli and S. aureus have undergone relatively recent exchange of chromosomal genes.
8070397	Three-dimensional structure of the ribosomal translocase: elongation factor G from Thermus thermophilus.	The crystal structure of Thermus thermophilus elongation factor G without guanine nucleotide was determined to 2.85 A. This GTPase has five domains with overall dimensions of 50 x 60 x 118 A. The GTP binding domain has a core common to other GTPases with a unique subdomain which probably functions as an intrinsic nucleotide exchange factor. Domains I and II are homologous to elongation factor Tu and their arrangement, both with and without GDP, is more similar to elongation factor Tu in complex with a GTP analogue than with GDP. Domains III and V show structural similarities to ribosomal proteins. Domain IV protrudes from the main body of the protein and has an extraordinary topology with a left-handed cross-over connection between two parallel beta-strands.
11223513	Structures of two highly homologous bacterial L-asparaginases: a case of enantiomorphic space groups.	Quasi-enantiomorphic crystals of the Y25F mutant of Escherichia coli L-asparaginase and of the native Erwinia chrysanthemi L-asparaginase were obtained in the hexagonal space groups P6(5)22 and P6(1)22, respectively. The structures of these highly homologous enzymes were solved by molecular replacement and were refined with data extending to 2.2-2.5 A. These structures were compared with each other, as well as with other L-asparaginase structures previously observed with different crystal packing. It is concluded that the observed phenomenon, which is rare, was most likely to have arisen by chance.
15368576	NMR and modeling studies of protein-carbohydrate interactions: synthesis, three-dimensional structure, and recognition properties of a minimum hevein domain with binding affinity for chitooligosaccharides.	HEV32, a 32-residue, truncated hevein lacking eleven C-terminal amino acids, was synthesized by solid-phase methodology and correctly folded with three cysteine bridge pairs. The affinities of HEV32 for small chitin fragments--in the forms of N,N',N"-triacetylchitotriose ((GlcNAc)3) (millimolar) and N,N',N",N"',N"",N""'-hexaacetylchitohexaose ((GlcNAc)6) (micromolar)--as measured by NMR and fluorescence methods, are comparable with those of native hevein. The HEV32 ligand-binding process is enthalpy driven, while entropy opposes binding. The NMR structure of ligand-bound HEV32 in aqueous solution was determined to be highly similar to the NMR structure of ligand-bound hevein. Solvated molecular-dynamics simulations were performed in order to monitor the changes in side-chain conformation of the binding site of HEV32 and hevein upon interaction with ligands. The calculations suggest that the Trp21 side-chain orientation of HEV32 in the free form differs from that in the bound state; this agrees with fluorescence and thermodynamic data. HEV32 provides a simple molecular model for studying protein-carbohydrate interactions and for understanding the physiological relevance of small native hevein domains lacking C-terminal residues.
10966813	Specificity in protein-protein interactions: the structural basis for dual recognition in endonuclease colicin-immunity protein complexes.	Bacteria producing endonuclease colicins are protected against their cytotoxic activity by virtue of a small immunity protein that binds with high affinity and specificity to inactivate the endonuclease. DNase binding by the immunity protein occurs through a "dual recognition" mechanism in which conserved residues from helix III act as the binding-site anchor, while variable residues from helix II define specificity. We now report the 1.7 A crystal structure of the 24.5 kDa complex formed between the endonuclease domain of colicin E9 and its cognate immunity protein Im9, which provides a molecular rationale for this mechanism. Conserved residues of Im9 form a binding-energy hotspot through a combination of backbone hydrogen bonds to the endonuclease, many via buried solvent molecules, and hydrophobic interactions at the core of the interface, while the specificity-determining residues interact with corresponding specificity side-chains on the enzyme. Comparison between the present structure and that reported recently for the colicin E7 endonuclease domain in complex with Im7 highlights how specificity is achieved by very different interactions in the two complexes, predominantly hydrophobic in nature in the E9-Im9 complex but charged in the E7-Im7 complex. A key feature of both complexes is the contact between a conserved tyrosine residue from the immunity proteins (Im9 Tyr54) with a specificity residue on the endonuclease directing it toward the specificity sites of the immunity protein. Remarkably, this tyrosine residue and its neighbour (Im9 Tyr55) are the pivots of a 19 degrees rigid-body rotation that relates the positions of Im7 and Im9 in the two complexes. This rotation does not affect conserved immunity protein interactions with the endonuclease but results in different regions of the specificity helix being presented to the enzyme.
12202494	Electrostatic effects and binding determinants in the catalysis of prolyl oligopeptidase. Site specific mutagenesis at the oxyanion binding site.	Prolyl oligopeptidase, a member of a new family of serine peptidases, plays an important role in memory disorders. Earlier x-ray crystallographic investigations indicated that stabilization of the tetrahedral transition state of the reaction involved hydrogen bond formation between the oxyanion of the tetrahedral intermediate and the OH group of Tyr(473). The contribution of the OH group was tested with the Y473F variant using various substrates. The charged succinyl-Gly-Pro-4-nitroanilide was hydrolyzed with a much lower k(cat)/K(m) compared with the neutral benzyloxycarbonyl-G1y-Pro-2-naphthylamide, although the binding modes of the two substrates were similar, as shown by x-ray crystallography. This suggested that electrostatic interactions between Arg(643) and the succinyl group competed with the productive binding mechanism. Unlike most enzyme reactions, catalysis by the wild-type enzyme exhibited positive activation entropy. In contrast, the activation entropy for the Y473F variant was negative, suggesting that the tyrosine OH group is involved in stabilizing both the transition state and the water shell at the active site. Importantly, Tyr(473) is also implicated in the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex. The nonlinear Arrhenius plot suggested a greater significance of the oxyanion binding site at physiological temperature. The results indicated that Tyr(473) was more needed at high pH, at high temperature, and with charged substrates exhibiting "internally competitive inhibition."
15170341	Role of hydrogen bonding in the active site of human manganese superoxide dismutase.	The side chain of Gln143, a conserved residue in manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), forms a hydrogen bond with the manganese-bound solvent and is critical in maintaining catalytic activity. The side chains of Tyr34 and Trp123 form hydrogen bonds with the carboxamide of Gln143. We have replaced Tyr34 and Trp123 with Phe in single and double mutants of human MnSOD and measured their catalytic activity by stopped-flow spectrophotometry and pulse radiolysis. The replacements of these side chains inhibited steps in the catalysis as much as 50-fold; in addition, they altered the gating between catalysis and formation of a peroxide complex to yield a more product-inhibited enzyme. The replacement of both Tyr34 and Trp123 in a double mutant showed that these two residues interact cooperatively in maintaining catalytic activity. The crystal structure of Y34F/W123F human MnSOD at 1.95 A resolution suggests that this effect is not related to a conformational change in the side chain of Gln143, which does not change orientation in Y34F/W123F, but rather to more subtle electronic effects due to the loss of hydrogen bonding to the carboxamide side chain of Gln143. Wild-type MnSOD containing Trp123 and Tyr34 has approximately the same thermal stability compared with mutants containing Phe at these positions, suggesting the hydrogen bonds formed by these residues have functional rather than structural roles.
8946854	Buried polar residues and structural specificity in the GCN4 leucine zipper.	A conserved asparagine (Asn 16) buried in the interface of the GCN4 leucine zipper selectively favours the parallel, dimeric, coiled-coil structure. To test if other polar residues confer oligomerization specificity, the structural effects of Gln and Lys substitutions for Asn 16 were characterized. Like the wild-type peptide, the Asn 16Lys mutant formed exclusively dimers. In contrast, Gln 16, despite its chemical similarity to Asn, allowed the peptide to form both dimers and trimers. The Gln 16 side chain was accommodated by qualitatively different interactions in the dimer and trimer crystal structures. These findings demonstrate that the structural selectivity of polar residues results not only from the burial of polar atoms, but also depends on the complementarity of the side-chain stereochemistry with the surrounding structural environment.
7500345	Kinetic and structural characterization of mutations of glycine 216 in alpha-lytic protease: a new target for engineering substrate specificity.	Gly216 in the active site of the broadly specific MA190 mutant of alpha-lytic protease has been found to be remarkably tolerant of amino acid substitutions. Side-chains as large as Trp can be accommodated within the substrate-binding pocket without abolishing catalysis, and have major effects upon the substrate specificity of the enzyme. Kinetic characterization of eleven enzymatically active mutants against a panel of eight substrates clearly revealed the functional consequences of the substitutions at position 216. To understand better the structural basis for their altered specificity, the GA216 + MA190 and GL216 + MA190 mutants have been crystallized both with and without a representative series of peptide boronic acid transition-state analog inhibitors. An empirical description and non-parametric statistical analysis of structural variation among these enzyme: inhibitor complexes is presented. The roles of active site plasticity and dynamics in alpha-lytic protease function and substrate preference are also addressed. The results strongly suggest that substrate specificity determination in alpha-lytic protease is a distributed property of the active site and substrate molecule.
12192070	Characterization and multiple molecular forms of TorD from Shewanella massilia, the putative chaperone of the molybdoenzyme TorA.	Several bacteria use trimethylamine N-oxyde (TMAO) as an exogenous electron acceptor for anaerobic respiration. This metabolic pathway involves expression of the tor operon that codes for a periplasmic molybdopterin-containing reductase of the DMSO/TMAO family, a pentahemic c-type cytochrome, and the TorD cytoplasmic chaperone, possibly required for acquisition of the molybdenum cofactor and translocation of the reductase by the twin-arginine translocation system. In this report, we show that the TorD chaperone from Shewanella massilia forms multiple and stable oligomeric species. The monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric forms were purified to homogeneity and characterized by analytical ultracentrifugation. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and preliminary diffraction data indicated that the TorD dimer is made of identical protein modules of similar size to the monomeric species. Interconversion of the native oligomeric forms occurred at acidic pH value. In this condition, ANS fluorescence indicates a non-native conformation of the polypeptide chain in which, according to the circular dichroism spectra, the alpha-helical content is similar to that of the native species. Surface plasmon resonance showed that both the monomeric and dimeric species bind the mature TorA enzyme, but that the dimer binds its target protein more efficiently. The possible biologic significance of these oligomers is discussed in relation to the chaperone activity of TorD, and to the ability of another member of the TorD family to bind the Twin Arginine leader sequences of the precursor of DMSO/TMAO reductases.
12364331	Oligosaccharide and sucrose complexes of amylosucrase. Structural implications for the polymerase activity.	The glucosyltransferase amylosucrase is structurally quite similar to the hydrolase alpha-amylase. How this switch in functionality is achieved is an important and fundamental question. The inactive E328Q amylosucrase variant has been co-crystallized with maltoheptaose, and the structure was determined by x-ray crystallography to 2.2 A resolution, revealing a maltoheptaose binding site in the B'-domain somewhat distant from the active site. Additional soaking of these crystals with maltoheptaose resulted in replacement of Tris in the active site with maltoheptaose, allowing the mapping of the -1 to +5 binding subsites. Crystals of amylosucrase were soaked with sucrose at different concentrations. The structures at approximately 2.1 A resolution revealed three new binding sites of different affinity. The highest affinity binding site is close to the active site but is not in the previously identified substrate access channel. Allosteric regulation seems necessary to facilitate access from this binding site. The structures show the pivotal role of the B'-domain in the transferase reaction. Based on these observations, an extension of the hydrolase reaction mechanism valid for this enzyme can be proposed. In this mechanism, the glycogen-like polymer is bound in the widest access channel to the active site. The polymer binding introduces structural changes that allow sucrose to migrate from its binding site into the active site and displace the polymer.
12144785	Structural bases of stability-function tradeoffs in enzymes.	The structures of enzymes reflect two tendencies that appear opposed. On one hand, they fold into compact, stable structures; on the other hand, they bind a ligand and catalyze a reaction. To be stable, enzymes fold to maximize favorable interactions, forming a tightly packed hydrophobic core, exposing hydrophilic groups, and optimizing intramolecular hydrogen-bonding. To be functional, enzymes carve out an active site for ligand binding, exposing hydrophobic surface area, clustering like charges, and providing unfulfilled hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. Using AmpC beta-lactamase, an enzyme that is well-characterized structurally and mechanistically, the relationship between enzyme stability and function was investigated by substituting key active-site residues and measuring the changes in stability and activity. Substitutions of catalytic residues Ser64, Lys67, Tyr150, Asn152, and Lys315 decrease the activity of the enzyme by 10(3)-10(5)-fold compared to wild-type. Concomitantly, many of these substitutions increase the stability of the enzyme significantly, by up to 4.7kcal/mol. To determine the structural origins of stabilization, the crystal structures of four mutant enzymes were determined to between 1.90A and 1.50A resolution. These structures revealed several mechanisms by which stability was increased, including mimicry of the substrate by the substituted residue (S64D), relief of steric strain (S64G), relief of electrostatic strain (K67Q), and improved polar complementarity (N152H). These results suggest that the preorganization of functionality characteristic of active sites has come at a considerable cost to enzyme stability. In proteins of unknown function, the presence of such destabilized regions may indicate the presence of a binding site.
15637152	Solution NMR-derived global fold of a monomeric 82-kDa enzyme.	The size of proteins that can be studied by solution NMR spectroscopy has increased significantly because of recent developments in methodology. Important experiments include those that make use of approaches that increase the lifetimes of NMR signals or that define the orientation of internuclear bond vectors with respect to a common molecular frame. The advances in NMR techniques are strongly coupled to isotope labeling methods that increase sensitivity and reduce the complexity of NMR spectra. We show that these developments can be exploited in structural studies of high-molecular-weight, single-polypeptide proteins, and we present the solution global fold of the monomeric 723-residue (82-kDa) enzyme malate synthase G from Escherichia coli, which has been extensively characterized by NMR in the past several years.
11478862	Structure and mechanism of the RuvB Holliday junction branch migration motor.	The RuvB hexamer is the chemomechanical motor of the RuvAB complex that migrates Holliday junction branch-points in DNA recombination and the rescue of stalled DNA replication forks. The 1.6 A crystal structure of Thermotoga maritima RuvB together with five mutant structures reveal that RuvB is an ATPase-associated with diverse cellular activities (AAA+-class ATPase) with a winged-helix DNA-binding domain. The RuvB-ADP complex structure and mutagenesis suggest how AAA+-class ATPases couple nucleotide binding and hydrolysis to interdomain conformational changes and asymmetry within the RuvB hexamer implied by the crystallographic packing and small-angle X-ray scattering in solution. ATP-driven domain motion is positioned to move double-stranded DNA through the hexamer and drive conformational changes between subunits by altering the complementary hydrophilic protein- protein interfaces. Structural and biochemical analysis of five motifs in the protein suggest that ATP binding is a strained conformation recognized both by sensors and the Walker motifs and that intersubunit activation occurs by an arginine finger motif reminiscent of the GTPase-activating proteins. Taken together, these results provide insights into how RuvB functions as a motor for branch migration of Holliday junctions.
8962085	Ordered water molecules as key allosteric mediators in a cooperative dimeric hemoglobin.	One of the most remarkable structural aspects of Scapharca dimeric hemoglobin is the disruption of a very well-ordered water cluster at the subunit interface upon ligand binding. We have explored the role of these crystallographically observed water molecules by site-directed mutagenesis and osmotic stress techniques. The isosteric mutation of Thr-72-->Val in the interface increases oxygen affinity more than 40-fold with a surprising enhancement of cooperativity. The only significant structural effect of this mutation is to destabilize two ordered water molecules in the deoxy interface. Wild-type Scapharca hemoglobin is strongly sensitive to osmotic conditions. Upon addition of glycerol, striking changes in Raman spectrum of the deoxy form are observed that indicate a transition toward the liganded form. Increased osmotic pressure, which lowers the oxygen affinity in human hemoglobin, raises the oxygen affinity of Scapharca hemoglobin regardless of whether the solute is glycerol, glucose, or sucrose. Analysis of these results provides an estimate of six water molecules lost upon oxygen binding to the dimer, in good agreement with eight predicted from crystal structures. These experiments suggest that the observed cluster of interfacial water molecules plays a crucial role in communication between subunits.
8676387	Thermodynamic and structural compensation in "size-switch" core repacking variants of bacteriophage T4 lysozyme.	Previous analysis of randomly generated multiple mutations within the core of bacteriophage T4 lysozyme suggested that the "large-to-small" substitution Leu121 to Ala (L121A) and the spatially adjacent "small-to-large" substitution Ala129 to Met (A129M) might be mutually compensating. To test this hypothesis, the individual variants L121A and A129M were generated, as well as the double "size-switch" mutant L121A/A129M. To make the interchange symmetrical, the combination of L121A with A129L to give L121A/A129L was also constructed. The single mutations were all destabilizing. Somewhat surprisingly, the small-to-large substitutions, which increase hydrophobic stabilization but can also introduce strain, were less deleterious than the large-to-small replacements. Both Ala129 --> Leu and Ala129 --> Met offset the destabilization of L121A by about 50%. Also, in contrast to typical Leu --> Ala core substitutions, which destabilize by 2 to 5 kcal/mol, Leu121 --> Ala slightly stabilized A129L and A129M. Crystal structure analysis showed that a combination of side-chain and backbone adjustments partially accommodated changes in side-chain volume, but only to a limited degree. For example, the cavity that was created by the Leu121 to Ala replacement actually became larger in L121A/A129L. The results demonstrate that the destabilization associated with a change in volume of one core residue can be specifically compensated by an offsetting volume change in an adjacent residue. It appears, however, that complete compensation is unlikely because it is difficult to reconstitute an equivalent set of interactions. The relatively slow evolution of core relative to surface residues appears, therefore, to be due to two factors. First, a mutation in a single core residue that results in a substantial change in size will normally lead to a significant loss in stability. Such mutations will presumably be selected against. Second, if a change in bulk does occur in a buried residue, it cannot normally be fully compensated by a mutation of an adjacent residue. Thus, the most probable response will tend to be reversion to the parent protein.
11384233	2-Amino-6-arylsulfonylbenzonitriles as non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors of HIV-1.	A series of 2-amino-5-arylthiobenzonitriles (1) was found to be active against HIV-1. Structural modifications led to the sulfoxides (2) and sulfones (3). The sulfoxides generally showed antiviral activity against HIV-1 similar to that of 1. The sulfones, however, were the most potent series of analogues, a number having activity against HIV-1 in the nanomolar range. Structural-activity relationship (SAR) studies suggested that a meta substituent, particularly a meta methyl substituent, invariably increased antiviral activities. However, optimal antiviral activities were manifested by compounds where both meta groups in the arylsulfonyl moiety were substituted and one of the substituents was a methyl group. Such a disubstitution led to compounds 3v, 3w, 3x, and 3y having IC50 values against HIV-1 in the low nanomolar range. When gauged for their broad-spectrum antiviral activity against key non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) related mutants, all the di-meta-substituted sulfones 3u-z and the 2-naphthyl analogue 3ee generally showed single-digit nanomolar activity against the V106A and P236L strains and submicromolar to low nanomolar activity against strains E138K, V108I, and Y188C. However, they showed a lack of activity against the K103N and Y181C mutant viruses. The elucidation of the X-ray crystal structure of the complex of 3v (739W94) in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase showed an overlap in the binding domain when compared with the complex of nevirapine in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. The X-ray structure allowed for the rationalization of SAR data and potencies of the compounds against the mutants.
10843854	Crystal structure of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAK pilin suggests a main-chain-dominated mode of receptor binding.	Fibers of pilin monomers (pili) form the dominant adhesin of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and they play an important role in infections by this opportunistic bacterial pathogen. Blocking adhesion is therefore a target for vaccine development. The receptor-binding site is located in a C-terminal disulphide-bonded loop of each pilin monomer, but functional binding sites are displayed only at the tip of the pilus. A factor complicating vaccination is that different bacterial strains produce distinct, and sometimes highly divergent, pilin variants. It is surprising that all strains still appear to bind a common receptor, asialo-GM1. Here, we present the 1.63 A crystal structure of pilin from P. aeruginosa strain PAK. The structure shows that the proposed receptor-binding site is formed by two beta-turns that create a surface dominated by main-chain atoms. Receptor specificity could therefore be maintained, whilst allowing side-chain variation, if the main-chain conformation is conserved. The location of the binding site relative to the proposed packing of the pilus fiber raises new issues and suggests that the current fiber model may have to be reconsidered. Finally, the structure of the C-terminal disulphide-bonded loop will provide the template for the structure-based design of a consensus sequence vaccine.
1583688	1.7 A X-ray structure of the periplasmic ribose receptor from Escherichia coli.	The X-ray structure of the periplasmic ribose receptor (binding protein) of Escherichia coli (RBP) was solved at 3 A resolution by the method of multiple isomorphous replacement. Alternating cycles of refitting and refinement have resulted in a model structure with an R-factor of 18.7% for 27,526 reflections from 7.5 to 1.7 A resolution (96% of the data). The model contains 2228 non-hydrogen atoms, including all 271 residues of the amino acid sequence, 220 solvent atoms and beta-D-ribose. The protein consists of two highly similar structural domains, each of which is composed of a core of parallel beta-sheet flanked on both sides by alpha-helices. The two domains are related to each other by an almost perfect 2-fold axis of rotation, with the C termini of the beta-strands of each sheet pointing toward the center of the molecule. Three short stretches of amino acid chain (from symmetrically related portions of the protein) link these two domains, and presumably act as a hinge to allow relative movement of the domains in functionally important conformational changes. Two water molecules are also an intrinsic part of the hinge, allowing crucial flexibility in the structure. The ligand beta-D-ribose (in the pyranose form) is bound between the domains, held by interactions with side-chains of the interior loops. The binding site is precisely tailored, with a combination of hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic and steric effects giving rise to tight binding (0.1 microM for ribose) and high specificity. Four out of seven binding-site residues are charged (2 each of aspartate and arginine) and contribute two hydrogen bonds each. The remaining hydrogen bonds are contributed by asparagine and glutamine residues. Three phenylalanine residues supply the hydrophobic component, packing against both faces of the sugar molecule. The arrangement of these hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic residues results in an enclosed binding site with the exact shape of the allowed sugar molecules; in the process of binding, the ligand loses all of its surface-accessible area. The sites of two mutations that affect the rate of folding of the ribose receptor are shown to be located near small cavities in the wild-type protein. The cavities thus allow the incorporation of the larger residues in the mutant proteins. Since these alterations would seriously affect the ability of the protein to build the first portion of the hydrophobic core in the first domain, it is proposed that this process is the rate-limiting step in folding of the ribose receptor.
8994974	The structural basis for pyrophosphatase catalysis.	BACKGROUND: Soluble inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPase), an essential enzyme central to phosphorus metabolism, catalyzes the hydrolysis of the phosphoanhydride bond in inorganic pyrophosphate. Catalysis requires divalent metal ions which affect the apparent pKas of the essential general acid and base on the enzyme, and the pKa of the substrate. Three to five metal ions are required for maximal activity, depending on pH and enzyme source. A detailed understanding of catalysis would aid both in understanding the nature of biological mechanisms of phosphoryl transfer, and in understanding the role of divalent cations. Without a high-resolution complex structure such a model has previously been unobtainable. RESULTS: We report the first two high-resolution structures of yeast PPase, at 2.2 and 2.0 A resolution with R factors of around 17%. One structure contains the two activating metal ions; the other, the product (MnPi)2 as well. The latter structure shows an extensive network of hydrogen bond and metal ion interactions that account for virtually every lone pair on the product phosphates. It also contains a water molecule/hydroxide ion bridging two metal ions and, uniquely, a phosphate bound to four Mn2+ ions. CONCLUSIONS: Our structure-based model of the PPase mechanism posits that the nucleophile is the hydroxide ion mentioned above. This aspect of the mechanism is formally analogous to the "two-metal ion' mechanism of alkaline phosphatase, exonucleases and polymerases. A third metal ion coordinates another water molecule that is probably the required general acid. Extensive Lewis acid coordination and hydrogen bonds provide charge shielding of the electrophile and lower the pKa of the leaving group. This "three-metal ion' mechanism is in detail different from that of other phosphoryl transfer enzymes, presumably reflecting how ancient the reaction is.
9677301	A general rule for the relationship between hydrophobic effect and conformational stability of a protein: stability and structure of a series of hydrophobic mutants of human lysozyme.	To get a general rule for the relationship between hydrophobic effect and conformational stability, five Ile to Val and nine Val to Ala mutants (3SS mutants) from 3SS (C77A/C95A) human lysozyme were constructed. As known from previous studies, the 3SS protein lacking a disulfide bond between Cys77 and Cys95 is destabilized by enthalpic factors, as revealed by a decrease of about 20 kJ/mol in the denaturation Gibbs energy change (DeltaG) value, as compared to the wild-type protein, which has four disulfide bonds. In this study, the stabilities and structures of the 3SS mutants were determined by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray crystal analysis, respectively, and compared with those of the mutants (4SS mutants) from the wild-type (4SS) protein published previously.The stabilities of all the 3SS mutants, except for V110A-3SS were decreased as compared with that of the 3SS protein, coinciding with the results for the 4SS mutants. The change in the denaturation Gibbs energy change (DeltaDeltaG) values of the 3SS mutants relative to the 3SS protein at the denaturation temperature (49.2 degreesC) of the 3SS protein at pH 2.7 were similar to those of the equivalent 4SS mutants relative to the wild-type at 64.9 degreesC.The Delta DeltaG values of the 3SS mutants correlated with the changes in hydrophobic surface area exposed upon denaturation (Delta DeltaASAHP) for all of the hydrophobic residues when the effects of the secondary structure propensity were considered. This correlation is identical with that previously found for the 4SS mutants. The linear relation between Delta DeltaG and Delta DeltaASAHP for all of the hydrophobic residues with the same slope was found also for the mutants of T4 lysozyme already reported, indicating that this is a general relationship between changes in conformational stability and changes in ASA values of hydrophobic residues due to mutations.
15557262	On the use of DXMS to produce more crystallizable proteins: structures of the T. maritima proteins TM0160 and TM1171.	The structure of two Thermotoga maritima proteins, a conserved hypothetical protein (TM0160) and a transcriptional regulator (TM1171), have now been determined at 1.9 A and 2.3 A resolution, respectively, as part of a large-scale structural genomics project. Our first efforts to crystallize full-length versions of these targets were unsuccessful. However, analysis of the recombinant purified proteins using the technique of enhanced amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectroscopy (DXMS) revealed substantial regions of rapid amide deuterium hydrogen exchange, consistent with flexible regions of the structures. Based on these exchange data, truncations were designed to selectively remove the disordered C-terminal regions, and the resulting daughter proteins showed greatly enhanced crystallizability. Comparative DXMS analysis of full-length protein versus truncated forms demonstrated complete and exact preservation of the exchange rate profiles in the retained sequence, indicative of conservation of the native folded structure. This study presents the first structures produced with the aid of the DXMS method for salvaging intractable crystallization targets. The structure of TM0160 represents a new fold and highlights the use of this approach where any prior structural knowledge is absent. The structure of TM1171 represents an example where the lack of a substrate/cofactor may impair crystallization. The details of both structures are presented and discussed.
10350464	Crystal structure of thiamin phosphate synthase from Bacillus subtilis at 1.25 A resolution.	The crystal structure of Bacillus subtilis thiamin phosphate synthase complexed with the reaction products thiamin phosphate and pyrophosphate has been determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction phasing techniques and refined to 1.25 A resolution. Thiamin phosphate synthase is an alpha/beta protein with a triosephosphate isomerase fold. The active site is in a pocket formed primarily by the loop regions, residues 59-67 (A loop, joining alpha3 and beta2), residues 109-114 (B loop, joining alpha5 and beta4), and residues 151-168 (C loop, joining alpha7 and beta6). The high-resolution structure of thiamin phosphate synthase complexed with its reaction products described here provides a detailed picture of the catalytically important interactions between the enzyme and the substrates. The structure and other mechanistic studies are consistent with a reaction mechanism involving the ionization of 4-amino-2-methyl-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine pyrophosphate at the active site to give the pyrimidine carbocation. Trapping of the carbocation by the thiazole followed by product dissociation completes the reaction. The ionization step is catalyzed by orienting the C-O bond perpendicular to the plane of the pyrimidine, by hydrogen bonding between the C4' amino group and one of the terminal oxygen atoms of the pyrophosphate, and by extensive hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions between the pyrophosphate and the enzyme.
8248779	A switch between two-, three-, and four-stranded coiled coils in GCN4 leucine zipper mutants.	Coiled-coil sequences in proteins consist of heptad repeats containing two characteristic hydrophobic positions. The role of these buried hydrophobic residues in determining the structures of coiled coils was investigated by studying mutants of the GCN4 leucine zipper. When sets of buried residues were altered, two-, three-, and four-helix structures were formed. The x-ray crystal structure of the tetramer revealed a parallel, four-stranded coiled coil. In the tetramer conformation, the local packing geometry of the two hydrophobic positions in the heptad repeat is reversed relative to that in the dimer. These studies demonstrate that conserved, buried residues in the GCN4 leucine zipper direct dimer formation. In contrast to proposals that the pattern of hydrophobic and polar amino acids in a protein sequence is sufficient to determine three-dimensional structure, the shapes of buried side chains in coiled coils are essential determinants of the global fold.
8967954	Structural basis for selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 by anti-inflammatory agents.	Prostaglandins and glucocorticoids are potent mediators of inflammation. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) exert their effects by inhibition of prostaglandin production. The pharmacological target of NSAIDs is cyclooxygenase (COX, also known as PGH synthase), which catalyses the first committed step in arachidonic-acid metabolism. Two isoforms of the membrane protein COX are known: COX-1, which is constitutively expressed in most tissues, is responsible for the physiological production of prostaglandins; and COX-2, which is induced by cytokines, mitogens and endotoxins in inflammatory cells, is responsible for the elevated production of prostaglandins during inflammation. The structure of ovine COX-1 complexed with several NSAIDs has been determined. Here we report the structures of unliganded murine COX-2 and complexes with flurbiprofen, indomethacin and SC-558, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, determined at 3.0 to 2.5 A resolution. These structures explain the structural basis for the selective inhibition of COX-2, and demonstrate some of the conformational changes associated with time-dependent inhibition.
10508408	Structural consequences of the B5 histidine --> tyrosine mutation in human insulin characterized by X-ray crystallography and conformational analysis.	The addition of phenols to hexameric insulin solutions produces a particularly stable hexamer, resulting from a rearrangement in which residues B1-B8 change from an extended conformation (T-state) to form an alpha-helix (R-state). The R-state is, in part, stabilized by nonpolar interactions between the phenolic molecule and residue B5 His at the dimer-dimer interface. The B5 His --> Tyr mutant human insulin was constructed to see if the tyrosine side chain would mimic the effect of phenol binding in the hexamer and induce the R-state. In partial support of this hypothesis, the molecule crystallized as a half-helical hexamer (T(3)R(3)) in conditions that conventionally promote the fully nonhelical (T6) form. As expected, in the presence of phenol or resorcinol, the B5 Tyr hexamers adopt the fully helical (R6) conformation. Molecular modeling calculations were performed to investigate the conformational preference of the T-state B5 Tyr side chain in the T(3)R(3) form, this side chain being associated with structural perturbations of the A7-A10 loop in an adjacent hexamer. For an isolated dimer, several different orientations of the side chain were found, which were close in energy and readily interconvertible. In the crystal environment only one of these conformations remains low in energy; this conformation corresponds to that observed in the crystal structure. This suggests that packing constraints around residue B5 Tyr result in the observed structural rearrangements. Thus, rather than promoting the R-state in a manner analogous to phenol, the mutation appears to destabilize the T-state. These studies highlight the role of B5 His in determining hexamer conformation and in mediating crystal packing interactions, properties that are likely be important in vivo.
2540825	Residual structure in large fragments of staphylococcal nuclease: effects of amino acid substitutions.	In an attempt to develop a model of the denatured state of staphylococcal nuclease that can be analyzed experimentally under physiological conditions, a series of four large fragments of this small protein which extend from residues 1 to 103, 1 to 112, 1 to 128, and 1 to 136 have been generated through the overexpression of nuclease genes containing stop codons at defined positions. Large amounts of protein fragments were accumulated in induced cells and were purified by carrying out all fractionation steps in the presence of 6 M urea. The far-ultraviolet circular dichroism spectra of all four fragments suggested the presence of small to moderate amounts of residual structure. When the CD spectra were monitored as a function of concentrations of the tight-binding ligands Ca2+ and thymidine 3',5'-bisphosphate and the known affinity constants for wild-type nuclease (1-149) were used, apparent equilibrium constants of 160 and 2000 for the reversible denaturation reaction for fragments 1-136 and 1-128, respectively, were estimated. Four single and two double mutations, all of which exhibit unusual behavior in the full-length protein on solvent denaturation [Shortle, D., & Meeker, A. K. (1986) Proteins: Struct., Funct., Genet. 1, 81-89] and thermal denaturation [Shortle, D., Meeker, A. K., & Freire, E. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 4761-4768], were recombined into the 1-136 and 1-128 fragment expression vectors, and purified mutant fragments were characterized.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
11738042	The 1.6 A crystal structure of E. coli argininosuccinate synthetase suggests a conformational change during catalysis.	BACKGROUND: Argininosuccinate synthetase (AS) is the rate-limiting enzyme of both the urea and arginine-citrulline cycles. In mammals, deficiency of AS leads to citrullinemia, a debilitating and often fatal autosomal recessive urea cycle disorder, whereas its overexpression for sustained nitric oxide production via the arginine-citrulline cycle leads to the potentially fatal hypotension associated with septic and cytokine-induced circulatory shock. RESULTS: The crystal structure of E. coli AS (EAS) has been determined by the use of selenomethionine incorporation and MAD phasing. The structure has been refined at 1.6 A resolution in the absence of its substrates and at 2.0 A in the presence of aspartate and citrulline (EAS*CIT+ASP). Each monomer of this tetrameric protein has two structural domains: a nucleotide binding domain similar to that of the "N-type" ATP pyrophosphatase class of enzymes, and a novel catalytic/multimerization domain. The EAS*CIT+ASP structure clearly describes the binding of citrulline at the cleft between the two domains and of aspartate to a loop of the nucleotide binding domain, whereas homology modeling with the N-type ATP pyrophosphatases has provided the location of ATP binding. CONCLUSIONS: The first three-dimensional structures of AS are reported. The fold of the nucleotide binding domain confirms AS as the fourth structurally defined member of the N-type ATP pyrophosphatases. The structures identify catalytically important residues and suggest the requirement for a conformational change during the catalytic cycle. Sequence similarity between the bacterial and human enzymes has been used for providing insight into the structural and functional effects of observed clinical mutations.
12820968	Structure of an mRNA capping enzyme bound to the phosphorylated carboxy-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II.	The 2.7 A structure of Candida albicans RNA guanylyltransferase Cgt1 cocrystallized with a carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) peptide composed of four Ser5-PO4 YSPTSPS heptad repeats illuminates distinct CTD-docking sites localized to the Cgt1 N-terminal nucleotidyl transferase domain. Tyr1, Pro3, Pro6, and Ser5-PO4 side chains from each of two YSPTSPS repeats contribute to the interface. Comparison to the Pin1-CTD structure shows that the CTD can assume markedly different conformations that are templated by particular binding partners. Structural plasticity combined with remodeling of CTD primary structure by kinases and phosphatases provides a versatile mechanism by which the CTD can recruit structurally dissimilar proteins during transcription. A binding site for the RNA triphosphatase component of the capping apparatus was also uncovered within the Cgt1 OB domain.
8144601	Binding of G protein beta gamma-subunits to pleckstrin homology domains.	Ligand-induced activation of many receptors leads to dissociation of the alpha- and beta gamma-subunit complexes of heterotrimeric G proteins, both of which regulate a variety of effector molecules involved in cellular signaling processes. In one case, a cytosolic enzyme, the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) binds to the dissociated, prenylated, membrane-anchored beta gamma-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (G beta gamma) and is thereby targeted to its membrane-bound receptor substrate. Quite recently, numerous proteins involved in cellular signal transduction have been shown to contain sequences homologous with a "domain" originally identified in the protein "pleckstrin" (pleckstrin homology domain; PH domain) and subsequently found in the G beta gamma interaction region of the beta ARK sequence. Here we demonstrate that glutathione S-transferase-fusion proteins, containing sequences encompassing the PH domain of nine proteins from this group, bind G beta gamma to varying extents. Binding of G beta gamma to these fusion proteins was documented either by a direct binding assay or by ability to block G beta gamma-mediated membrane translocation of beta ARK1. G beta gamma binding to these fusion proteins was inhibited by the alpha subunit of Go (Go alpha), indicating that the binding of G beta gamma to G alpha and the PH domain-containing fusion proteins is mutually exclusive. Studies with a series of truncated PH domains derived from the Ras-guanine-nucleotide-releasing factor indicate that the G beta gamma binding domain includes only the C-terminal portion of the PH domain and sequences just distal to this. Protein-protein interactions between G beta gamma and PH domain-containing proteins may play a significant role in cellular signaling analogous to that previously demonstrated for Src homology 2 and 3 domains.
10493860	Engineered Bacillus lentus subtilisins having altered flexibility.	The three-dimensional structures of engineered variants of Bacillus lentus subtilisin having increased enzymatic activity, K27R/N87S/V104Y/N123S/T274A (RSYSA) and N76D/N87S/S103A/V104I (DSAI), were determined by X-ray crystallography. In addition to identifying changes in atomic position we report a method that identifies protein segments having altered flexibility. The method utilizes a statistical analysis of variance to delineate main-chain temperature factors that represent significant departures from the overall variance between equivalent regions seen throughout the structure. This method reveals changes in main-chain mobility in both variants. Residues 125-127 have increased mobility in the RSYSA variant while residues 100-104 have decreased mobility in the DSAI variant. These segments are located at the substrate-binding site and changes in their mobility are believed to relate to the observed changes in proteolytic activity. The effect of altered crystal lattice contacts on segment flexibility becomes apparent when identical variants, determined in two crystal forms, are compared with the native enzyme.
12484753	Local protein dynamics and catalysis: detection of segmental motion associated with rate-limiting product release by a glutathione transferase.	Glutathione transferase rGSTM1-1 catalyzes the addition of glutathione (GSH) to 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, a reaction in which the chemical step is 60-fold faster than the physical step of product release. The hydroxyl group of Y115, located in the active site access channel, controls the egress of product from the active site. The Y115F mutant enzyme has a k(cat) (72 s(-)(1)) that is 3.6-fold larger than that of the native enzyme (20 s(-)(1)). Crystallographic observations and evidence from amide proton exchange kinetics are consistent with localized increases in the degree of segmental motion of the Y115F mutant that are coupled to the enhanced rate of product release. The loss of hydrogen bonding interactions involving the hydroxyl group of Y115 is reflected in subtle alterations in the backbone position, an increase in B-factors for structural elements that comprise the channel to the active site, and, most dramatically, a loss of well-defined electron density near the site of mutation. The kinetics of amide proton exchange are also enhanced by a factor between 3 and 12 in these regions, providing direct, quantitative evidence for changes in local protein dynamics affecting product release. The enhanced product release rate is proposed to derive from a small shift in the equilibrium population of protein conformers that permit egress of the product from the active site.
9790663	Kinetic analysis and X-ray structure of haloalkane dehalogenase with a modified halide-binding site.	Haloalkane dehalogenase (DhlA) catalyzes the hydrolysis of haloalkanes via an alkyl-enzyme intermediate. Trp175 forms a halogen/halide-binding site in the active-site cavity together with Trp125. To get more insight in the role of Trp175 in DhlA, we mutated residue 175 and explored the kinetics and X-ray structure of the Trp175Tyr enzyme. The mutagenesis study indicated that an aromatic residue at position 175 is important for the catalytic performance of DhlA. Pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of Trp175Tyr-DhlA showed that the observed 6-fold increase of the Km for 1,2-dibromoethane (DBE) results from reduced rates of both DBE binding and cleavage of the carbon-bromine bond. Furthermore, the enzyme isomerization preceding bromide release became 4-fold faster in the mutant enzyme. As a result, the rate of hydrolysis of the alkyl-enzyme intermediate became the main determinant of the kcat for DBE, which was 2-fold higher than the wild-type kcat. The X-ray structure of the mutant enzyme at pH 6 showed that the backbone structure of the enzyme remains intact and that the tyrosine side chain lies in the same plane as Trp175 in the wild-type enzyme. The Clalpha-stabilizing aromatic rings of Tyr175 and Trp125 are 0.7 A further apart and due to the smaller size of the mutated residue, the volume of the cavity has increased by one-fifth. X-ray structures of mutant and wild-type enzyme at pH 5 demonstrated that the Tyr175 side chain rotated away upon binding of an acetic acid molecule, leaving one of its oxygen atoms hydrogen bonded to the indole nitrogen of Trp125 only. These structural changes indicate a weakened interaction between residue 175 and the halogen atom or halide ion in the active site and help to explain the kinetic changes induced by the Trp175Tyr mutation.
12093271	Role of His505 in the soluble fumarate reductase from Shewanella frigidimarina.	The X-ray structure of the soluble fumarate reductase from Shewanella frigidimarina [Taylor, P., Pealing, S. L., Reid, G. A., Chapman, S. K., and Walkinshaw, M. D. (1999) Nat. Struct. Biol. 6, 1108-1112] clearly shows the presence of an internally bound sodium ion. This sodium ion is coordinated by one solvent water molecule (Wat912) and five backbone carbonyl oxygens from Thr506, Met507, Gly508, Glu534, and Thr536 in what is best described as octahedral geometry (despite the rather long distance from the sodium ion to the backbone oxygen of Met507 (3.1 A)). The water ligand (Wat912) is, in turn, hydrogen bonded to the imidazole ring of His505. This histidine residue is adjacent to His504, a key active-site residue thought to be responsible for the observed pK(a) of the enzyme. Thus, it is possible that His505 may be important in both maintaining the sodium site and in influencing the active site. Here we describe the crystallographic and kinetic characterization of the H505A and H505Y mutant forms of the Shewanella fumarate reductase. The crystal structures of both mutant forms of the enzyme have been solved to 1.8 and 2.0 A resolution, respectively. Both show the presence of the sodium ion in the equivalent position to that found in the wild-type enzyme. The structure of the H505A mutant shows the presence of two water molecules in place of the His505 side-chain which form part of a hydrogen-bonding network with Wat48, a ligand to the sodium ion. The structure of the H505Y mutant shows the hydroxyl group of the tyrosine side-chain hydrogen-bonding to a water molecule which is also a ligand to the sodium ion. Apart from these features, there are no significant structural alterations as a result of either substitution. Both the mutant enzymes are catalytically active but show markedly different pH profiles compared to the wild-type enzyme. At high pH (above 8.5), the wild type and mutant enzymes have very similar activities. However, at low pH (6.0), the H505A mutant enzyme is some 20-fold less active than wild-type. The combined crystallographic and kinetic results suggest that His505 is not essential for sodium binding but does affect catalytic activity perhaps by influencing the pK(a) of the adjacent His504.
9826509	Inactivity of N229A thymidylate synthase due to water-mediated effects: isolating a late stage in methyl transfer.	Mutation of thymidylate synthase N229(177) to alanine results in an essentially inactive enzyme, yet it leads to formation of a stable ternary complex. The kinetics of N229(177)A show that kcat for Escherichia coli is reduced by 200-fold while the Km for dUMP is increased 200-fold and the Km for folate increased by tenfold versus the wild-type enzyme. The crystal structures of N229(177)A in complex with dUMP and CB3717, and in complex with dUMP alone are determined at 2.4 A, and 2.5 A resolution. These structures identify the covalently bound ternary complex and show how N229(177)A traps an intermediate, and so becomes inactive in a later step of the reaction. Since the smaller alanine side-chain at N229(177)A does not directly sterically impair binding of ligands, the structures implicate, and place quantitative limits on the involvement of the structured water network in the active site of thymidylate synthase in both catalysis and in determining the binding affinity for dUMP (in contrast, the N229(177)V mutation in Lactobacillus casei has minimal effect on activity).
10347159	Identification of amino acid residues critical for aggregation of human CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES. Characterization of active disaggregated chemokine variants.	Human CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed) self-associate to form high-molecular mass aggregates. To explore the biological significance of chemokine aggregation, nonaggregating variants were sought. The phenotypes of 105 hMIP-1alpha variants generated by systematic mutagenesis and expression in yeast were determined. hMIP-1alpha residues Asp26 and Glu66 were critical to the self-association process. Substitution at either residue resulted in the formation of essentially homogenous tetramers at 0.5 mg/ml. Substitution of identical or analogous residues in homologous positions in both hMIP-1beta and RANTES demonstrated that they were also critical to aggregation. Our analysis suggests that a single charged residue at either position 26 or 66 is insufficient to support extensive aggregation and that two charged residues must be present. Solution of the three-dimensional NMR structure of hMIP-1alpha has enabled comparison of these residues in hMIP-1beta and RANTES. Aggregated and disaggregated forms of hMIP-1alpha, hMIP-1beta, and RANTES generally have equivalent G-protein-coupled receptor-mediated biological potencies. We have therefore generated novel reagents to evaluate the role of hMIP-1alpha, hMIP-1beta, and RANTES aggregation in vitro and in vivo. The disaggregated chemokines retained their human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) inhibitory activities. Surprisingly, high concentrations of RANTES, but not disaggregated RANTES variants, enhanced infection of cells by both M- and T-tropic HIV isolates/strains. This observation has important implications for potential therapeutic uses of chemokines implying that disaggregated forms may be necessary for safe clinical investigation.
9988734	Identification of the calcium binding site and a novel ytterbium site in blood coagulation factor XIII by x-ray crystallography.	The presence or absence of calcium determines the activation, activity, oligomerization, and stability of blood coagulation factor XIII. To explore these observed effects, we have determined the x-ray crystal structure of recombinant factor XIII A2 in the presence of calcium, strontium, and ytterbium. The main calcium binding site within each monomer involves the main chain oxygen atom of Ala-457, and also the side chains from residues Asn-436, Asp-438, Glu-485, and Glu-490. Calcium and strontium bind in the same location, while ytterbium binds several angstroms removed. A novel ytterbium binding site is also found at the dimer two-fold axis, near residues Asp-270 and Glu-272, and this site may be related to the reported inhibition by lanthanide metals (Achyuthan, K. E., Mary, A., and Greenberg, C. S. (1989) Biochem. J. 257, 331-338). The overall structure of ion-bound factor XIII is very similar to the previously determined crystal structures of factor XIII zymogen, likely due to the constraints of this monoclinic crystal form. We have merged the three independent sets of water molecules in the structures to determine which water molecules are conserved and possibly structurally significant.

10430876	Structural basis of the conversion of T4 lysozyme into a transglycosidase by reengineering the active site.	In contrast to hen egg-white lysozyme, which retains the beta-configuration of the substrate in the product, T4 lysozyme (T4L) is an inverting glycosidase. The substitution Thr-26 --> His, however, converts T4L from an inverting to a retaining enzyme. It is shown here that the Thr-26 --> His mutant is also a transglycosidase. Indeed, the transglycosylation reaction can be more effective than hydrolysis. In contrast, wild-type T4L has no detectable transglycosidase activity. The results support the prior hypothesis that catalysis by the Thr-26 --> His mutant proceeds via a covalent intermediate. Further mutations (Glu-11 --> His, Asp-20 --> Cys) of the T26H mutant lysozyme indicate that the catalytic mechanism of this mutant requires Glu-11 as a general acid but Asp-20 is not essential. The results help provide an overall rationalization for the activity of glycosidases, in which a highly conserved acid group (Glu-11 in T4L, Glu-35 in hen egg-white lysozyme) on the beta-side of the substrate acts as a proton donor, whereas alterations in the placement and chemical identity of residues on the alpha-side of the substrate can lead to catalysis with or without retention of the configuration, to transglycosidase activity, or to the formation of a stable enzyme-substrate adduct.
15835899	Crystallographic evidence for a new ensemble of ligand-induced allosteric transitions in hemoglobin: the T-to-T(high) quaternary transitions.	A detailed description of hemoglobin cooperativity requires knowledge of the dimer-dimer interactions responsible for the low ligand affinity of the quaternary-T tetramer, the "quaternary-T constraints", along with stereochemical pathways that specify how ligand binding disrupts these quaternary constraints. The recent mutagenic screen of Noble et al. [Noble, R. W., et al. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 12357-12368] has identified the major region of quaternary constraint to be a cluster of residues at the alpha1beta2 interface that is centered at Trp37beta. In this paper, crystallographic studies are presented for most of the mutant hemoglobins studied by Noble et al. These crystallographic experiments identify structural transitions-referred to as T-to-T(High) transitions-between the quaternary-T structure of wild-type deoxyhemoglobin and an ensemble of related T-like quaternary structures that are induced by some mutations in the Trp37beta cluster and/or by exposing crystals of wild-type or mutant deoxyhemoglobins to oxygen. The T-to-T(High) quaternary transitions consist of a rotation of the alpha1beta1 dimer relative to the alpha2beta2 dimer as well as a coupled alphabeta dimer bending component that consists of a small rotation of the alpha1 subunit relative to the beta1 subunit (and a symmetry related rotation of the alpha2 subunit relative to the beta2 subunit). In addition, differences in subunit tertiary structure associated with the T-to-T(High) transitions suggest two stereochemical pathways (one associated with the alpha subunits and one associated with the betasubunits) by which ligand binding specifically disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta cluster. In the alpha subunits, ligand binding induces a shift of the heme iron producing tension in a chain of covalent bonds that extends from the Fe-N(epsilon)(2)His(F8)alpha1 bond to the peptide backbone bonds of residues His87(F8)alpha1 and Ala88(F9)alpha1. This tension induces an alpha-to-pi transition in the COOH-terminal end of the F-helix that shifts the beta-carbon of Ala88alpha1 by approximately 1.5 A directly into the side chain of Tyr140alpha1 (a key residue in the Trp37beta2 cluster). Collectively these structural changes constitute a relatively short pathway by which ligand binding forces Tyr140alpha1 into the alpha1beta2 interface disrupting quaternary constraints associated with the Trp37beta2 cluster. In the beta subunits, our analysis suggests a more extended energy transduction pathway in which ligand-induced beta1-heme movement triggers tertiary changes in the beta1 subunit that promote alpha1beta1 dimer bending that disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta2 cluster at the alpha1beta2 interface.
9082984	Flexibility in DNA recombination: structure of the lambda integrase catalytic core.	Lambda integrase is archetypic of site-specific recombinases that catalyze intermolecular DNA rearrangements without energetic input. DNA cleavage, strand exchange, and religation steps are linked by a covalent phosphotyrosine intermediate in which Tyr342 is attached to the 3'-phosphate of the DNA cut site. The 1.9 angstrom crystal structure of the integrase catalytic domain reveals a protein fold that is conserved in organisms ranging from archaebacteria to yeast and that suggests a model for interaction with target DNA. The attacking Tyr342 nucleophile is located on a flexible loop about 20 angstroms from a basic groove that contains all the other catalytically essential residues. This bipartite active site can account for several apparently paradoxical features of integrase family recombinases, including the capacity for both cis and trans cleavage of DNA.
8172877	Engineering alternative beta-turn types in staphylococcal nuclease.	We have refined the crystal structures of three point mutants of staphylococcal nuclease designed to favor alternative beta-turn types. Single amino acid substitutions were made in a type VIa beta-turn (residues 115-118; Tyr-Lys-Pro-Asn) containing a cis Lys 116-Pro 117 peptide bond. The mutations result in two new backbone conformations, a type I beta-turn for P117T and a type I' beta-turn for P117G and P117A. The P117G and P117A structures exhibit a dramatic difference in backbone conformation in the region of the mutation compared to the nuclease A structure such that the side chain of Lys 116 is reoriented to point into the nucleotide binding pocket. The distinct conformation observed for the nuclease A, P117G, and P117T beta-turn sequences agrees with correlations between beta-turn type and sequence identified from protein crystal structures. The P117A turn conformation provides an exception to these correlations. The results demonstrate that single residue changes can significantly alter backbone conformation, illustrating the process by which diversity in the structure of the protein surface can evolve on a conserved structural core, and suggest protein engineering applications in which the positioning as well as the identify of side chains can be modified to design new enzyme functions. Nuclease variants at the type VIa beta-turn site also allow the relationship between the amino acid sequence and beta-turn conformation to be examined in the context of an identical protein fold in crystallographic detail.
8690718	Construction of a plasmid used for the expression of a sevenfold-mutant barley beta-amylase with increased thermostability in Escherichia coli and properties of the sevenfold-mutant beta-amylase.	To increase the thermostability of beta-amylase, seven kinds of single-mutant plasmids were constructed with an expression vector of barley beta-amylase by mutagenesis. The remaining activity versus temperature curves were used to determine the temperatures (T50) at which 50% of the initial activity was lost during a 30-min heating period. These mutations increased the T50 values by amounts ranging from 0.8 to 3.2 degrees C. To express the sevenfold-mutant beta-amylase in Escherichia coli, plasmid pB927 was constructed. E. coli harboring plasmid pB927 produced sevenfold-mutant beta- amylase. The T50 value of purified sevenfold-mutant beta-amylase (69.0 degrees C) was higher than that of not only the original recombinant beta-amylase (57.4 degrees C) by 11.6 degrees C but also soybean beta-amylase (63.2 degrees C) by 5.8 degrees C. The intragenic amino acid replacements were found to have simple additive effects on the thermostability of beta-amylase. The sevenfold-mutant beta-amylase was found to be stable at pHs up to 12.5, while the original recombinant beta-amylase was unstable at pHs above 9.5. The data obtained from kinetics studies suggested that the sevenfold-mutant beta-amylase acquired enhanced thermostability, but its function as a beta-amylase remained unchanged.
11243784	Transthyretin stability as a key factor in amyloidogenesis: X-ray analysis at atomic resolution.	Transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis is a conformational disturbance, which, like other amyloidoses, represents a life threat. Here, we report a TTR variant, TTR Thr119Met, that has been shown to have a protective role in the development of clinical symptoms in carriers of TTR Val30Met, one of the most frequent variants among TTR amyloidosis patients. In order to understand this effect, we have determined the structures of the TTR Val30Met/Thr119Met double mutant isolated from the serum of one patient and of both the native and thyroxine complex of TTR Thr119Met. Major conclusions are: (i) new H-bonds within each monomer and monomer-monomer inter-subunit contacts, e.g. Ser117-Ser117 and Met119-Tyr114, increase protein stability, possibly leading to the protective effect of the TTR Val30Met/Thr119Met variant when compared to the single variant TTR Val30Met. (ii) The mutated residue (Met119) extends across the thyroxine binding channel inducing conformational changes that lead to closer contacts between different dimers within the tetramer. The data, at atomic resolution, were essential to detect, for the first time, the subtle changes in the inter-subunit contacts of TTR, and explain the non-amyloidogenic potential of the TTR Thr119Met variant, improving considerably current research on the TTR amyloid fibril formation pathway.
9761872	Crystallization and preliminary diffraction studies of pentaerythritol tetranitrate reductase from Enterobacter cloacae PB2.	Pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) reductase of Enterobacter cloacae PB2, a flavoprotein involved in the biodegradation of the explosive PETN, ethylene glycol dinitrate (EGDN) and glycerol trinitrate (GTN), was purified from an overexpressing strain of E. coli and crystallized at 293 K using the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method. Diffraction data can be seen at 1.8 A. The primitive orthorhombic cell has a monomer in the asymmetric unit. Preliminary molecular-replacement calculations have been performed using a search model based on Old Yellow enzyme.
12962482	Mechanisms of redox-coupled proton transfer in proteins: role of the proximal proline in reactions of the [3Fe-4S] cluster in Azotobacter vinelandii ferredoxin I.	The 7Fe ferredoxin from Azotobacter vinelandii (AvFdI) contains a [3Fe-4S](+/0) cluster that binds a single proton in its reduced level. Although the cluster is buried, and therefore inaccessible to solvent, proton transfer from solvent to the cluster is fast. The kinetics and energetics of the coupled electron-proton transfer reaction at the cluster have been analyzed in detail by protein-film voltammetry, to reveal that proton transfer is mediated by the mobile carboxylate of an adjacent surface residue, aspartate-15, the pK of which is sensitive to the charge on the cluster. This paper examines the role of a nearby proline residue, proline-50, in proton transfer and its coupling to electron transfer. In the P50A and P50G mutants, a water molecule has entered the cluster binding region; it is hydrogen bonded to the backbone amide of residue-50 and to the Asp-15 carboxylate, and it is approximately 4 A from the closest sulfur atom of the cluster. Despite the water molecule linking the cluster more directly to the solvent, proton transfer is not accelerated. A detailed analysis reveals that Asp-15 remains a central part of the mechanism. However, the electrostatic coupling between cluster and carboxylate is almost completely quenched, so that cluster reduction no longer induces such a favorable shift in the carboxylate pK, and protonation of the base no longer induces a significant shift in the pK of the cluster. The electrostatic coupling is crucial for maintaining the efficiency of proton transfer both to and from the cluster, over a range of pH values.
10198633	Structural basis for paramyxovirus-mediated membrane fusion.	Paramyxoviruses are responsible for significant human mortality and disease worldwide, but the molecular mechanisms underlying their entry into host cells remain poorly understood. We have solved the crystal structure of a fragment of the simian parainfluenza virus 5 fusion protein (SV5 F), revealing a 96 A long coiled coil surrounded by three antiparallel helices. This structure places the fusion and transmembrane anchor of SV5 F in close proximity with a large intervening domain at the opposite end of the coiled coil. Six amino acids, potentially part of the fusion peptide, form a segment of the central coiled coil, suggesting that this structure extends into the membrane. Deletion mutants of SV5 F indicate that putative flexible tethers between the coiled coil and the viral membrane are dispensable for fusion. The lack of flexible tethers may couple a final conformational change in the F protein directly to the fusion of two bilayers.
12006984	Structural basis for the selective activation of Rho GTPases by Dbl exchange factors.	Activation of Rho-family GTPases involves the removal of bound GDP and the subsequent loading of GTP, all catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) of the Dbl-family. Despite high sequence conservation among Rho GTPases, Dbl proteins possess a wide spectrum of discriminatory potentials for Rho-family members. To rationalize this specificity, we have determined crystal structures of the conserved, catalytic fragments (Dbl and pleckstrin homology domains) of the exchange factors intersectin and Dbs in complex with their cognate GTPases, Cdc42 and RhoA, respectively. Structure-based mutagenesis of intersectin and Dbs reveals the key determinants responsible for promoting exchange activity in Cdc42, Rac1 and RhoA. These findings provide critical insight into the structural features necessary for the proper pairing of Dbl-exchange factors with Rho GTPases and now allow for the detailed manipulation of signaling pathways mediated by these oncoproteins in vivo.
11419952	Solution-state NMR investigations of triosephosphate isomerase active site loop motion: ligand release in relation to active site loop dynamics.	Product release is partially rate determining in the isomerization reaction catalyzed by Triosephosphate Isomerase, the conversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate to D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, probably because an active-site loop movement is necessary to free the product from confinement in the active-site. The timescale of the catalytic loop motion and of ligand release were studied using 19F and 31P solution-state NMR. A 5'-fluorotryptophan was incorporated in the loop N-terminal hinge as a reporter of loop motion timescale. Crystallographic studies confirmed that the structure of the fluorinated enzyme is indistinguishable from the wild-type; the fluorine accepts a hydrogen bond from water and not from a protein residue, with minimal perturbation to the flexible loop stability. Two distinct loop conformations were observed by 19F NMR. Both for unligated (empty) and ligated enzyme samples a single species was detected, but the chemical shifts of these two distinct species differed by 1.2 ppm. For samples in the presence of subsaturating amounts of a substrate analogue, glycerol 3-phosphate, both NMR peaks were present, with broadened lineshapes at 0 degrees C. In contrast, a single NMR peak representing a rapid average of the two species was observed at 30 degrees C. We conclude that the rate of loop motion is less than 1400 s(-1) at 0 degrees C and more than 1400 s(-1) at 30 degrees C. Ligand release was studied under similar sample conditions, using 31P NMR of the phosphate group of the substrate analogue. The rate of ligand release is less than 1000 s(-1) at 0 degrees C and more than 1000 s(-1) at 30 degrees C. Therefore, loop motion and product release are probably concerted and likely to represent a rate limiting step for chemistry.
16472737	Structure of the catalytic and ubiquitin-associated domains of the protein kinase MARK/Par-1.	The Ser/Thr kinase MARK2 phosphorylates tau protein at sites that cause detachment from microtubules in Alzheimer neurofibrillary degeneration. Homologs of MARK2 include Par-1 in C. elegans and Drosophila, which generates embryonic polarity. We report the X-ray structure of the catalytic and ubiquitin-associated domains (UBA) of human MARK2. The activity was altered by mutations in the ATP binding site and/or activation loop. The catalytic domain shows the small and large lobes typical of kinases. The substrate cleft is in an inactive, open conformation in the inactivated and the wild-type structure. The UBA domain is attached via a taut linker to the large lobe of the kinase domain and leans against a hydrophobic patch on the small lobe. The UBA structure is unusual because the orientation of its third helix is inverted, relative to previous structures. Possible implications of the structure for the regulation of kinase activity are discussed.
15274923	Chromophore conformation and the evolution of tertiary structural changes in photoactive yellow protein.	We use time-resolved crystallography to observe the structural progression of a bacterial blue light photoreceptor throughout its photocycle. Data were collected from 10 ns to 100 ms after photoactivation of the E46Q mutant of photoactive yellow protein. Refinement of transient chromophore conformations shows that the spectroscopically distinct intermediates are formed via progressive disruption of the hydrogen bond network to the chromophore. Although structural change occurs within a few nanoseconds on and around the chromophore, it takes milliseconds for a distinct pattern of tertiary structural change to fully progress through the entire molecule, thus generating the putative signaling state. Remarkably, the coupling between the chromophore conformation and the tertiary structure of this small protein is not tight: there are leads and lags between changes in the conformation of the chromophore and the protein tertiary structure.
10556241	Roles of catalytic residues in alpha-amylases as evidenced by the structures of the product-complexed mutants of a maltotetraose-forming amylase.	The crystal structures of the four product-complexed single mutants of the catalytic residues of Pseudomonas stutzeri maltotetraose-forming alpha-amylase, E219G, D193N, D193G and D294N, have been determined. Possible roles of the catalytic residues Glu219, Asp193 and Asp294 have been discussed by comparing the structures among the previously determined complexed mutant E219Q and the present mutant enzymes. The results suggested that Asp193 predominantly works as the base catalyst (nucleophile), whose side chain atom lies in close proximity to the C1-atom of Glc4, being involved in the intermediate formation in the hydrolysis reaction. While Asp294 works for tightly binding the substrate to give a twisted and a deformed conformation of the glucose ring at position -1 (Glc4). The hydrogen bond between the side chain atom of Glu219 and the O1-atom of Glc4, that implies the possibility of interaction via hydrogen, consistently present throughout these analyses, supports the generally accepted role of this residue as the acid catalyst (proton donor).
15710600	Demonstration of isoleucine 199 as a structural determinant for the selective inhibition of human monoamine oxidase B by specific reversible inhibitors.	Several reversible inhibitors selective for human monoamine oxidase B (MAO B) that do not inhibit MAO A have been described in the literature. The following compounds: 8-(3-chlorostyryl)caffeine, 1,4-diphenyl-2-butene, and trans,trans-farnesol are shown to inhibit competitively human, horse, rat, and mouse MAO B with K(i) values in the low micromolar range but are without effect on either bovine or sheep MAO B or human MAO A. In contrast, the reversible competitive inhibitor isatin binds to all known MAO B and MAO A with similar affinities. Sequence alignments and the crystal structures of human MAO B in complex with 1,4-diphenyl-2-butene or with trans,trans-farnesol provide molecular insights into these specificities. These inhibitors span the substrate and entrance cavities with the side chain of Ile-199 rotated out of its normal conformation suggesting that Ile-199 is gating the substrate cavity. Ile-199 is conserved in all known MAO B sequences except bovine MAO B, which has Phe in this position (the sequence of sheep MAO B is unknown). Phe is conserved in the analogous position in MAO A sequences. The human MAO B I199F mutant protein of MAO B binds to isatin (K(i) = 3 microM) but not to the three inhibitors listed above. The crystal structure of this mutant demonstrates that the side chain of Phe-199 interferes with the binding of those compounds. This suggests that the Ile-199 "gate" is a determinant for the specificity of these MAO B inhibitors and provides a molecular basis for the development of MAO B-specific reversible inhibitors without interference with MAO A function in neurotransmitter metabolism.
10799511	Binding of the second generation non-nucleoside inhibitor S-1153 to HIV-1 reverse transcriptase involves extensive main chain hydrogen bonding.	S-1153 (AG1549) is perhaps the most promising non-nucleoside inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase currently under development as a potential anti-AIDS drug, because it has a favorable profile of resilience to many drug resistance mutations. We have determined the crystal structure of S-1153 in a complex with HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. The complex possesses some novel features, including an extensive network of hydrogen bonds involving the main chain of residues 101, 103, and 236 of the p66 reverse transcriptase subunit. Such interactions are unlikely to be disrupted by side chain mutations. The reverse transcriptase/S-1153 complex suggests different ways in which resilience to mutations in the non-nucleoside inhibitors of reverse transcriptase binding site can be achieved.
2856083	The use of molecular-replacement phases for the refinement of the human rhinovirus 14 structure.	The structure of human rhinovirus 14 has been refined, by the method of restrained least squares, to an R factor of 0.16 for various random samples between 6 and 3 A resolution with F greater than 3 sigma (F). As a first step the non-crystallographic symmetry parameters were optimized using the initial atomic model in a rigid-body refinement procedure. Phase determination by the molecular-replacement phase extension and refinement procedure was continued to 2.94 A resolution, employing the improved non-crystallographic symmetry operators. The resultant structure-factor phases and weights, together with the measured amplitudes, constituted the X-ray observations used in the restrained refinement. The Hendrickson-Konnert program system [Konnert & Hendrickson (1980). Acta Cryst. A36, 344-350] was modified to incorporate non-crystallographic symmetry constrains and structure-factor phases as observations. The non-bonded contacts between subunits related by non-crystallographic symmetry were also restrained.
12693929	NMR structure of a bifunctional rhodamine labeled N-domain of troponin C complexed with the regulatory "switch" peptide from troponin I: implications for in situ fluorescence studies in muscle fibers.	The structure of the calcium-saturated regulatory domain of skeletal troponin C (sNTnC) complexed with the switch peptide comprising residues 115-131 of troponin I (TnI), and with a bifunctional rhodamine fluorescent label attached to residues 56 (E56C) and 63 (E63C) on the C helix of sNTnC, has been determined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The structure shows that the integrity of the C helix is not altered by the E(56,63)C mutations or by the presence of the bifunctional rhodamine and that the label does not interact with the hydrophobic cleft of sNTnC. Moreover, the overall fold of the protein and the position of the TnI peptide are similar to those observed previously with related cardiac NTnC complexes with residues 147-163 of cardiac TnI [Li et al. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 8289-8298] and including the drug bepridil [Wang et al. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 31124-31133]. The degree of opening of the structure is reduced as compared to that of calcium-saturated sNTnC in the absence of the switch peptide [Gagni et al. (1995) Nat. Struct. Biol. 2, 784-789]. The switch peptide is bound in a shallow and complementary hydrophobic surface cleft largely defined by helices A and B and also has key ionic interactions with sNTnC. These results show that bifunctional rhodamine probes can be attached to surface helices via suitable pairs of solvent-accessible residues that have been mutated to cysteines, without altering the conformation of the labeled domain. A set of such probes can be used to determine the orientation and motion of the target domain in the cellular environment [Corrie et al. (1999) Nature 400, 425-430; Ferguson et al. (2003) Mol. Cell 11(4), in press].
12963380	Repacking the Core of T4 lysozyme by automated design.	Automated protein redesign, as implemented in the program ORBIT, was used to redesign the core of phage T4 lysozyme. A total of 26 buried or partially buried sites in the C-terminal domain were allowed to vary both their sequence and side-chain conformation while the backbone and non-selected side-chains remained fixed. A variant with seven substitutions ("Core-7") was identified as having the most favorable energy. The redesign experiment was repeated with a penalty for the presence of methionine residues. In this case the redesigned protein ("Core-10") had ten amino acid changes. The two designed proteins, as well as the constituent single mutants, and several single-site revertants were over-expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and subjected to crystallographic and thermal analyses. The thermodynamic and structural data show that some repacking was achieved although neither redesigned protein was more stable than the wild-type protein. The use of the methionine penalty was shown to be effective. Several of the side-chain rotamers in the predicted structure of Core-10 differ from those observed. Rather than changing to new rotamers predicted by the design process, side-chains tend to maintain conformations similar to those seen in the native molecule. In contrast, parts of the backbone change by up to 2.8A relative to both the designed structure and wild-type.Water molecules that are present within the lysozyme molecule were removed during the design process. In the redesigned protein the resultant cavities were, to some degree, re-occupied by side-chain atoms. In the observed structure, however, water molecules were still bound at or near their original sites. This suggests that it may be preferable to leave such water molecules in place during the design procedure. The results emphasize the specificity of the packing that occurs within the core of a typical protein. While point substitutions within the core are tolerated they almost always result in a loss of stability. Likewise, combinations of substitutions may also be tolerated but usually destabilize the protein. Experience with T4 lysozyme suggests that a general core repacking methodology with retention or enhancement of stability may be difficult to achieve without provision for shifts in the backbone.
11453993	The contribution of metal ions to the conformational stability of ribonuclease T1: crystal versus solution.	In the crystalline state, ribonuclease T1 binds calcium ions at different lattice-dependent positions. In solution, its conformational stability is also remarkably increased in the presence of divalent metal ions. Combining urea unfolding studies and X-ray crystallography, we compared the presence of several metal ions at specific sites in the protein to their contribution to the overall stabilizing effect in solution. We constructed thermodynamic cycles involving particular metal ions and specific carboxylate functions. The resulting coupling energies indicate that some (but not all) metal ions found at lattice contacts in crystal structures may indeed significantly contribute to stability enhancement in the presence of metal ions in solution.
15698569	Assessment of the robustness of a serendipitous zinc binding fold: mutagenesis and protein grafting.	Zinc binding motifs have received much attention in the area of protein design. Here, we have tested the suitability of a recently discovered nonnative zinc binding structure as a protein design scaffold. A series of multiple alanine mutants was created to investigate the minimal requirements for folding, and solution structures of these mutants showed that the original fold was maintained, despite changes in approximately 50% of the sequence. We next attempted to transplant binding faces from chosen bimolecular interactions onto one of these mutants, and many of the resulting "chimeras" were shown to adopt a native-like fold. These results both highlight the robust nature of small zinc binding domains and underscore the complexity of designing functional proteins, even using such small, highly ordered scaffolds as templates.

9689112	3'-Azido-3'-deoxythymidine drug resistance mutations in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase can induce long range conformational changes.	HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) is one of the main targets for the action of anti-AIDS drugs. Many of these drugs [e.g., 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) and 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI)] are analogues of the nucleoside substrates used by the HIV RT. One of the main problems in anti-HIV therapy is the selection of a mutant virus with reduced drug sensitivity. Drug resistance in HIV is generated for nucleoside analogue inhibitors by mutations in HIV RT. However, most of these mutations are situated some distance from the polymerase active site, giving rise to questions concerning the mechanism of resistance. To understand the possible structural bases for this, the crystal structures of AZT- and ddI-resistant RTs have been determined. For the ddI-resistant RT with a mutation at residue 74, no significant conformational changes were observed for the p66 subunit. In contrast, for the AZT-resistant RT (RTMC) bearing four mutations, two of these (at 215 and 219) give rise to a conformational change that propagates to the active site aspartate residues. Thus, these drug resistance mutations produce an effect at the RT polymerase site mediated simply by the protein. It is likely that such long-range effects could represent a common mechanism for generating drug resistance in other systems.
1422155	1H and 15N resonance assignments and secondary structure of the human thioredoxin C62A, C69A, C73A mutant.	The complete assignment of 1H and 15N backbone resonances and near-complete 1H side-chain resonance assignments have been obtained for the reduced form of a mutant of human thioredoxin (105 residues) in which the three non-active site cysteines have been substituted by alanines: C62A, C69A, C73A. The assignments were made primarily on the basis of three-dimensional 15N-separated nuclear Overhauser and Hartmann-Hahn spectroscopy, in conjunction with two-dimensional homonuclear and heteronuclear correlation experiments. Based on comparisons of short-range and interstrand nuclear Overhauser effects, patterns of amide exchange, and chemical-shift differences, the structure appears essentially unchanged from that of the previously determined solution structure of the native protein [Forman-Kay, J.D. et al. (1991) Biochemistry, 30, 2685-2698]. An assay for thioredoxin shows that the C62A, C69A, C73A mutant retains activity. The assignment of the spectrum for this mutant of human thioredoxin constitutes the basis for future studies aimed at comparing the details of the active-site conformation in the reduced and oxidized forms of the protein.
11937054	The structure and mechanism of the type II dehydroquinase from Streptomyces coelicolor.	The structure of the type II DHQase from Streptomyces coelicolor has been solved and refined to high resolution in complexes with a number of ligands, including dehydroshikimate and a rationally designed transition state analogue, 2,3-anhydro-quinic acid. These structures define the active site of the enzyme and the role of key amino acid residues and provide snap shots of the catalytic cycle. The resolution of the flexible lid domain (residues 21-31) shows that the invariant residues Arg23 and Tyr28 close over the active site cleft. The tyrosine acts as the base in the initial proton abstraction, and evidence is provided that the reaction proceeds via an enol intermediate. The active site of the structure of DHQase in complex with the transition state analog also includes molecules of tartrate and glycerol, which provide a basis for further inhibitor design.
11575933	Structural mechanisms of drug resistance for mutations at codons 181 and 188 in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and the improved resilience of second generation non-nucleoside inhibitors.	Mutations at either Tyr181 or Tyr188 within HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) give high level resistance to many first generation non-nucleoside inhibitors (NNRTIs) such as the anti-AIDS drug nevirapine. By comparison second generation inhibitors, for instance the drug efavirenz, show much greater resilience to these mutations. In order to understand the structural basis for these differences we have determined a series of seven crystal structures of mutant RTs in complexes with first and second generation NNRTIs as well as one example of an unliganded mutant RT. These are Tyr181Cys RT (TNK-651) to 2.4 A, Tyr181Cys RT (efavirenz) to 2.6 A, Tyr181Cys RT (nevirapine) to 3.0 A, Tyr181Cys RT (PETT-2) to 3.0 A, Tyr188Cys RT (nevirapine) to 2.6 A, Tyr188Cys RT (UC-781) to 2.6 A and Tyr188Cys RT (unliganded) to 2.8 A resolution. In the two previously published structures of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase with mutations at 181 or 188 no side-chain electron density was observed within the p66 subunit (which contains the inhibitor binding pocket) for the mutated residues. In contrast the mutated side-chains can be seen in the NNRTI pocket for all seven structures reported here, eliminating the possibility that disordering contributes to the mechanism of resistance. In the case of the second generation compounds efavirenz with Tyr181Cys RT and UC-781 with Tyr188Cys RT there are only small rearrangements of either inhibitor within the binding site compared to wild-type RT and also for the first generation compounds TNK-651, PETT-2 and nevirapine with Tyr181Cys RT. For nevirapine with the Tyr188Cys RT there is however a more substantial movement of the drug molecule. We conclude that protein conformational changes and rearrangements of drug molecules within the mutated sites are not general features of these particular inhibitor/mutant combinations. The main contribution to drug resistance for Tyr181Cys and Tyr188Cys RT mutations is the loss of aromatic ring stacking interactions for first generation compounds, providing a simple explanation for the resilience of second generation NNRTIs, as such interactions make much less significant contribution to their binding.
11801599	Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A binds RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) NS5B and modulates RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity.	Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B is RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), the essential catalytic enzyme for HCV replication. Recently, NS5A has been reported to be important for the establishment of HCV replication in vitro by the adaptive mutations, although its role in viral replication remains uncertain. Here we report that purified bacterial recombinant NS5A and NS5B directly interact with each other in vitro, detected by glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay. Furthermore, complex formation of these proteins transiently coexpressed in mammalian cells was detected by coprecipitation. Using terminally and internally truncated NS5A, two discontinuous regions of NS5A (amino acids 105-162 and 277-334) outside of the adaptive mutations were identified to be independently essential for the binding both in vivo and in vitro (Yamashita, T., Kaneko, S., Shirota, Y., Qin, W., Nomura, T., Kobayashi, K., and Mkyrakami, S. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 15479-15486). We previously examined the effect of His-NS5A on RdRP activity of the soluble recombinant NS5Bt in vitro (see Yamashita et al. above). Wild NS5A weakly stimulated at first (when less than 0.1 molar ratio to NS5B) and then inhibited the NS5Bt RdRP activity in a dose-dependent manner. The internal deletion mutants defective in NS5B binding exhibited no inhibitory effect, indicating that the NS5B binding is necessary for the inhibition. Taken together, our results support the idea that NS5A modulates HCV replication as a component of replication complex.
6088778	Virion orientation in cubic crystals of the human common cold virus HRV14.	A new cubic crystal form (a = 445.1 A) of space group P23 is reported for human rhinovirus R14. There are four particles per unit cell, each situated on a crystallographic 3-fold axis. The orientation of these particles has been determined with a rotation function and their approximate positions have been derived from a Patterson map. The crystals diffract to at least 2.8 A resolution. Limitations to the possible surface features of the virus are set by a comparison of the cubic and orthorhombic crystal forms.
15544809	Crystal structures of five bovine chymotrypsin complexes with P1 BPTI variants.	The bovine chymotrypsin-bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) interaction belongs to extensively studied models of protein-protein recognition. The accommodation of the inhibitor P1 residue in the S1 binding site of the enzyme forms the hot spot of this interaction. Mutations introduced at the P1 position of BPTI result in a more than five orders of magnitude difference of the association constant values with the protease. To elucidate the structural aspects of the discrimination between different P1 residues, crystal structures of five bovine chymotrypsin-P1 BPTI variant complexes have been determined at pH 7.8 to a resolution below 2 A. The set includes polar (Thr), ionizable (Glu, His), medium-sized aliphatic (Met) and large aromatic (Trp) P1 residues and complements our earlier studies of the interaction of different P1 side-chains with the S1 pocket of chymotrypsin. The structures have been compared to the complexes of proteases with similar and dissimilar P1 preferences, including Streptomyces griseus proteases B and E, human neutrophil elastase, crab collagenase, bovine trypsin and human thrombin. The S1 sites of these enzymes share a common general shape of significant rigidity. Large and branched P1 residues adapt in their complexes similar conformations regardless of the polarity and size differences between their S1 pockets. Conversely, long and flexible residues such as P1 Met are present in the disordered form and display a conformational diversity despite similar inhibitory properties with respect to most enzymes studied. Thus, the S1 specificity profiles of the serine proteases appear to result from the precise complementarity of the P1-S1 interface and minor conformational adjustments occurring upon the inhibitor binding.
11732897	A structural view of the action of Escherichia coli (lacZ) beta-galactosidase.	The structures of a series of complexes designed to mimic intermediates along the reaction coordinate for beta-galactosidase are presented. These complexes clarify and enhance previous proposals regarding the catalytic mechanism. The nucleophile, Glu537, is seen to covalently bind to the galactosyl moiety. Of the two potential acids, Mg(2+) and Glu461, the latter is in better position to directly assist in leaving group departure, suggesting that the metal ion acts in a secondary role. A sodium ion plays a part in substrate binding by directly ligating the galactosyl 6-hydroxyl. The proposed reaction coordinate involves the movement of the galactosyl moiety deep into the active site pocket. For those ligands that do bind deeply there is an associated conformational change in which residues within loop 794-804 move up to 10 A closer to the site of binding. In some cases this can be inhibited by the binding of additional ligands. The resulting restricted access to the intermediate helps to explain why allolactose, the natural inducer for the lac operon, is the preferred product of transglycosylation.
9446652	Antibodies from patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia/thrombosis recognize different epitopes on heparin: platelet factor 4.	Antibodies associated with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia/ thrombosis (HITT) are now thought to be specific for complexes formed between heparin and platelet factor 4 (PF4), a basic protein found normally in platelet alpha granules. How these antibodies cause thrombocytopenia and, in some patients, thrombosis, is not fully understood, in part because purified antibodies that could be labeled and used as probes to characterize target epitopes have not been available. We developed a novel method for antibody purification involving binding to and elution from PF4 complexed to heparin immobilized by end-linkage (EL) to a solid phase. Isolated antibodies were functional and after biotinylation, reacted with heparin: PF4 complexes in the same manner as unlabeled antibodies. Using these probes, we found that antibodies from 11 patients with HITT recognized two, and probably three, distinct sites on heparin: PF4 complexes. The antibodies did not bind to PF4 complexed with heparin immobilized by multiple chemical cross-linkages, suggesting that the heparin molecule must be in a flexible, relatively unconstrained state to react with PF4 in such a way as to create sites for HITT antibody binding.

16208361	Structure of the CED-4-CED-9 complex provides insights into programmed cell death in Caenorhabditis elegans.	Interplay among four genes--egl-1, ced-9, ced-4 and ced-3--controls the onset of programmed cell death in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Activation of the cell-killing protease CED-3 requires CED-4. However, CED-4 is constitutively inhibited by CED-9 until its release by EGL-1. Here we report the crystal structure of the CED-4-CED-9 complex at 2.6 A resolution, and a complete reconstitution of the CED-3 activation pathway using homogeneous proteins of CED-4, CED-9 and EGL-1. One molecule of CED-9 binds to an asymmetric dimer of CED-4, but specifically recognizes only one of the two CED-4 molecules. This specific interaction prevents CED-4 from activating CED-3. EGL-1 binding induces pronounced conformational changes in CED-9 that result in the dissociation of the CED-4 dimer from CED-9. The released CED-4 dimer further dimerizes to form a tetramer, which facilitates the autoactivation of CED-3. Together, our studies provide important insights into the regulation of cell death activation in C. elegans.
10677497	Determination of the binding sites of the proton transfer inhibitors Cd2+ and Zn2+ in bacterial reaction centers.	The reaction center (RC) from Rhodobacter sphaeroides couples light-driven electron transfer to protonation of a bound quinone acceptor molecule, Q(B), within the RC. The binding of Cd(2+) or Zn(2+) has been previously shown to inhibit the rate of reduction and protonation of Q(B). We report here on the metal binding site, determined by x-ray diffraction at 2.5-A resolution, obtained from RC crystals that were soaked in the presence of the metal. The structures were refined to R factors of 23% and 24% for the Cd(2+) and Zn(2+) complexes, respectively. Both metals bind to the same location, coordinating to Asp-H124, His-H126, and His-H128. The rate of electron transfer from Q(A)(-) to Q(B) was measured in the Cd(2+)-soaked crystal and found to be the same as in solution in the presence of Cd(2+). In addition to the changes in the kinetics, a structural effect of Cd(2+) on Glu-H173 was observed. This residue was well resolved in the x-ray structure-i.e., ordered-with Cd(2+) bound to the RC, in contrast to its disordered state in the absence of Cd(2+), which suggests that the mobility of Glu-H173 plays an important role in the rate of reduction of Q(B). The position of the Cd(2+) and Zn(2+) localizes the proton entry into the RC near Asp-H124, His-H126, and His-H128. Based on the location of the metal, likely pathways of proton transfer from the aqueous surface to Q(B) are proposed.
14717710	Mutational and structural analysis of cobalt-containing nitrile hydratase on substrate and metal binding.	Mutants of a cobalt-containing nitrile hydratase (NHase, EC 4.2.1.84) from Pseudonocardia thermophila JCM 3095 involved in substrate binding, catalysis and formation of the active center were constructed, and their characteristics and crystal structures were investigated. As expected from the structure of the substrate binding pocket, the wild-type enzyme showed significantly lower K(m) and K(i) values for aromatic substrates and inhibitors, respectively, than aliphatic ones. In the crystal structure of a complex with an inhibitor (n-butyric acid) the hydroxyl group of betaTyr68 formed hydrogen bonds with both n-butyric acid and alphaSer112, which is located in the active center. The betaY68F mutant showed an elevated K(m) value and a significantly decreased k(cat) value. The apoenzyme, which contains no detectable cobalt atom, was prepared from Escherichia coli cells grown in medium without cobalt ions. It showed no detectable activity. A disulfide bond between alphaCys108 and alphaCys113 was formed in the apoenzyme structure. In the highly conserved sequence motif in the cysteine cluster region, two positions are exclusively conserved in cobalt-containing or iron-containing nitrile hydratases. Two mutants (alphaT109S and alphaY114T) were constructed, each residue being replaced with an iron-containing one. The alphaT109S mutant showed similar characteristics to the wild-type enzyme. However, the alphaY114T mutant showed a very low cobalt content and catalytic activity compared with the wild-type enzyme, and oxidative modifications of alphaCys111 and alphaCys113 residues were not observed. The alphaTyr114 residue may be involved in the interaction with the nitrile hydratase activator protein of P. thermophila.
8977129	Core mutants of the immunoglobulin binding domain of streptococcal protein G: stability and structural integrity.	A library of core mutants of the GB1 domain of streptococcal protein G was created, and the structure and stability of selected members was assessed by 1H-15N heteronuclear correlation NMR spectroscopy and fluorescence. All mutants comprised changes in beta-sheet residues, with sidechains at positions 5 (Leu), 7 (Leu), 52 (Phe) and 54 (Val) forming the beta-sheet side of the sheet-helix core interface. A solvent exposed position Ile-6 was chosen as a control. Randomization of bases at codon positions 1 and 3 with thymine at position 2 introduces five possible hydrophobic amino acids, namely Leu, Val, Ile, Phe, and Met. The distribution of encoded amino acids at all five positions is approximately as expected theoretically and indicates that no major bias was introduced towards particular residues. The overall structural integrity of several mutants, as assessed by NMR, ranges from very close to wild type to fully unfolded. Interestingly, the stability of the mutants is not strictly correlated with the number of changes or residue volume.
2994218	Three-dimensional structure of poliovirus at 2.9 A resolution.	The three-dimensional structure of poliovirus has been determined at 2.9 A resolution by x-ray crystallographic methods. Each of the three major capsid proteins (VP1, VP2, and VP3) contains a "core" consisting of an eight-stranded antiparallel beta barrel with two flanking helices. The arrangement of beta strands and helices is structurally similar and topologically identical to the folding pattern of the capsid proteins of several icosahedral plant viruses. In each of the major capsid proteins, the "connecting loops" and NH2- and COOH-terminal extensions are structurally dissimilar. The packing of the subunit "cores" to form the virion shell is reminiscent of the packing in the T = 3 plant viruses, but is significantly different in detail. Differences in the orientations of the subunits cause dissimilar contacts at protein-protein interfaces, and are also responsible for two major surface features of the poliovirion: prominent peaks at the fivefold and threefold axes of the particle. The positions and interactions of the NH2- and COOH-terminal strands of the capsid proteins have important implications for virion assembly. Several of the "connecting loops" and COOH-terminal strands form prominent radial projections which are the antigenic sites of the virion.
3972100	Essential structure for full enterotoxigenic activity of heat-stable enterotoxin produced by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli.	Several analogues of heat-stable enterotoxins (STh and STp) produced by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli were synthesized. Peptides (STh[6-18] and STp[5-17]) consisting of 13 amino acid residues from the Cys residue near the N-terminus to the Cys residue near the C-terminus and linked by three disulfide bonds had the same biological and immunological properties as native STh and STp, respectively. The results indicated that the sequence with the 13 amino acid residues and three disulfide linkages is essential for full biological activity of ST.
8175707	Structural basis of the 70-kilodalton heat shock cognate protein ATP hydrolytic activity. II. Structure of the active site with ADP or ATP bound to wild type and mutant ATPase fragment.	The ATPase fragment of the bovine 70-kDa heat shock cognate protein is an attractive construct in which to study its mechanism of ATP hydrolysis. The three-dimensional structure suggests several residues that might participate in the ATPase reaction. Four acidic residues (Asp-10, Glu-175, Asp-199, and Asp-206) have been individually mutated to both the cognate amine (asparagine/glutamine) and to serine, and the effects of the mutations on the kinetics of the ATPase activity (Wilbanks, S. M., DeLuca-Flaherty, C., and McKay, D. B. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 12893-12898) and the structure of the mutant ATPase fragments have been determined, typically to approximately 2.4 A resolution. Additionally, the structures of the wild type protein complexed with MgADP and Pi, MgAMPPNP (5'-adenylyl-beta, gamma-imidodiphosphate) and CaAMPPNP have been refined to 2.1, 2.4, and 2.4 A, respectively. Combined, these structures provide models for the prehydrolysis, MgATP-bound state and the post-hydrolysis, MgADP-bound state of the ATPase fragment. These models suggest a pathway for the hydrolytic reaction in which 1) the gamma phosphate of bound ATP reorients to form a beta, gamma-bidentate phosphate complex with the Mg2+ ion, allowing 2) in-line nucleophilic attack on the gamma phosphate by a H2O molecule or OH- ion, with 3) subsequent release of inorganic phosphate.
10622255	Structure of a transiently phosphorylated switch in bacterial signal transduction.	Receiver domains are the dominant molecular switches in bacterial signalling. Although several structures of non-phosphorylated receiver domains have been reported, a detailed structural understanding of the activation arising from phosphorylation has been impeded by the very short half-lives of the aspartylphosphate linkages. Here we present the first structure of a receiver domain in its active state, the phosphorylated receiver domain of the bacterial enhancer-binding protein NtrC (nitrogen regulatory protein C). Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were taken during steady-state autophosphorylation/dephosphorylation, and three-dimensional spectra from multiple samples were combined. Phosphorylation induces a large conformational change involving a displacement of beta-strands 4 and 5 and alpha-helices 3 and 4 away from the active site, a register shift and an axial rotation in helix 4. This creates an exposed hydrophobic surface that is likely to transmit the signal to the transcriptional activation domain.
8134350	Structure of the gene V protein of bacteriophage f1 determined by multiwavelength x-ray diffraction on the selenomethionyl protein.	The crystal structure of the dimeric gene V protein of bacteriophage f1 was determined using multiwavelength anomalous diffraction on the selenomethionine-containing wild-type and isoleucine-47-->methionine mutant proteins with x-ray diffraction data phased to 2.5 A resolution. The structure of the wild-type protein has been refined to an R factor of 19.2% using native data to 1.8 A resolution. The structure of the gene V protein was used to obtain a model for the protein portion of the gene V protein-single-stranded DNA complex.
9287153	Structure-function relationships in Anabaena ferredoxin: correlations between X-ray crystal structures, reduction potentials, and rate constants of electron transfer to ferredoxin:NADP+ reductase for site-specific ferredoxin mutants.	A combination of structural, thermodynamic, and transient kinetic data on wild-type and mutant Anabaena vegetative cell ferredoxins has been used to investigate the nature of the protein-protein interactions leading to electron transfer from reduced ferredoxin to oxidized ferredoxin:NADP+ reductase (FNR). We have determined the reduction potentials of wild-type vegetative ferredoxin, heterocyst ferredoxin, and 12 site-specific mutants at seven surface residues of vegetative ferredoxin, as well as the one- and two-electron reduction potentials of FNR, both alone and in complexes with wild-type and three mutant ferredoxins. X-ray crystallographic structure determinations have been carried out for six of the ferredoxin mutants. None of the mutants showed significant structural changes in the immediate vicinity of the [2Fe-2S] cluster, despite large decreases in electron-transfer reactivity (for E94K and S47A) and sizable increases in reduction potential (80 mV for E94K and 47 mV for S47A). Furthermore, the relatively small changes in Calpha backbone atom positions which were observed in these mutants do not correlate with the kinetic and thermodynamic properties. In sharp contrast to the S47A mutant, S47T retains electron-transfer activity, and its reduction potential is 100 mV more negative than that of the S47A mutant, implicating the importance of the hydrogen bond which exists between the side chain hydroxyl group of S47 and the side chain carboxyl oxygen of E94. Other ferredoxin mutations that alter both reduction potential and electron-transfer reactivity are E94Q, F65A, and F65I, whereas D62K, D68K, Q70K, E94D, and F65Y have reduction potentials and electron-transfer reactivity that are similar to those of wild-type ferredoxin. In electrostatic complexes with recombinant FNR, three of the kinetically impaired ferredoxin mutants, as did wild-type ferredoxin, induced large (approximately 40 mV) positive shifts in the reduction potential of the flavoprotein, thereby making electron transfer thermodynamically feasible. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that nonconservative mutations of three critical residues (S47, F65, and E94) on the surface of ferredoxin have large parallel effects on both the reduction potential and the electron-transfer reactivity of the [2Fe-2S] cluster and that the reduction potential changes are not the principal factor governing electron-transfer reactivity. Rather, the kinetic properties are most likely controlled by the specific orientations of the proteins within the transient electron-transfer complex.
11567087	Structural investigations of the active-site mutant Asn156Ala of outer membrane phospholipase A: function of the Asn-His interaction in the catalytic triad.	Outer membrane phospholipase A (OMPLA) from Escherichia coli is an integral-membrane enzyme with a unique His-Ser-Asn catalytic triad. In serine proteases and serine esterases usually an Asp occurs in the catalytic triad; its role has been the subject of much debate. Here the role of the uncharged asparagine in the active site of OMPLA is investigated by structural characterization of the Asn156Ala mutant. Asparagine 156 is not involved in maintaining the overall active-site configuration and does not contribute significantly to the thermal stability of OMPLA. The active-site histidine retains an active conformation in the mutant notwithstanding the loss of the hydrogen bond to the asparagine side chain. Instead, stabilization of the correct tautomeric form of the histidine can account for the observed decrease in activity of the Asn156Ala mutant.
12691748	Amino acid discrimination by a class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase specified by negative determinants.	The 2.5 A crystal structure of Escherichia coli glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase in a quaternary complex with tRNA(Gln), an ATP analog and glutamate reveals that the non-cognate amino acid adopts a distinct binding mode within the active site cleft. In contrast to the binding of cognate glutamine, one oxygen of the charged glutamate carboxylate group makes a direct ion-pair interaction with the strictly conserved Arg30 residue located in the first half of the dinucleotide fold domain. The nucleophilic alpha-carboxylate moiety of glutamate is mispositioned with respect to both the ATP alpha-phosphate and terminal tRNA ribose groups, suggesting that a component of amino acid discrimination resides at the catalytic step of the reaction. Further, the other side-chain carboxylate oxygen of glutamate is found in a position identical to that previously proposed to be occupied by the NH(2) group of the cognate glutamine substrate. At this position, the glutamate oxygen accepts hydrogen bonds from the hydroxyl moiety of Tyr211 and a water molecule. These findings demonstrate that amino acid specificity by GlnRS cannot arise from hydrogen bonds donated by the cognate glutamine amide to these same moieties, as previously suggested. Instead, Arg30 functions as a negative determinant to drive binding of non-cognate glutamate into a non-productive orientation. The poorly differentiated cognate amino acid-binding site in GlnRS may be a consequence of the late emergence of this enzyme from the eukaryotic lineage of glutamyl-tRNA synthetases.
11839309	The crystal structure of human tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase, Tdp1.	Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase (Tdp1) catalyzes the hydrolysis of a phosphodiester bond between a tyrosine residue and a DNA 3' phosphate. The enzyme appears to be responsible for repairing the unique protein-DNA linkage that occurs when eukaryotic topoisomerase I becomes stalled on the DNA in the cell. The 1.69 A crystal structure reveals that human Tdp1 is a monomer composed of two similar domains that are related by a pseudo-2-fold axis of symmetry. Each domain contributes conserved histidine, lysine, and asparagine residues to form a single active site. The structure of Tdp1 confirms that the protein has many similarities to the members of the phospholipase D (PLD) superfamily and indicates a similar catalytic mechanism. The structure also suggests how the unusual protein-DNA substrate binds and provides insights about the nature of the substrate in vivo.
7619795	X-ray structures of the myosin motor domain of Dictyostelium discoideum complexed with MgADP.BeFx and MgADP.AlF4-.	The three-dimensional structures of the truncated myosin head from Dictyostelium discoideum myosin II complexed with beryllium and aluminum fluoride and magnesium ADP are reported at 2.0 and 2.6 A resolution, respectively. Crystals of the beryllium fluoride-MgADP complex belong to space group P2(1)2(1)2 with unit cell parameters of a = 105.3 A, b = 182.6 A, and c = 54.7 A, whereas the crystals of the aluminum fluoride complex belong to the orthorhombic space group C222(1) with unit cell dimensions of a = 87.9 A, b = 149.0 A, and c = 153.8 A. Chemical modification was not necessary to obtain these crystals. These structures reveal the location of the nucleotide complexes and define the amino acid residues that form the active site. The tertiary structure of the protein complexed with MgADP.BeFx is essentially identical to that observed previously in the three-dimensional model of chicken skeletal muscle myosin subfragment-1 in which no nucleotide was present. By contrast, the complex with MgADP.AlF4- exhibits significant domain movements. The structures suggest that the MgADP.BeFx complex mimics the ATP bound state and the MgADP.AlF4- complex is an analog of the transition state for hydrolysis. The domain movements observed in the MgADP.AlF4- complex indicate that myosin undergoes a conformational change during hydrolysis that is not associated with the nucleotide binding pocket but rather occurs in the COOH-terminal segment of the myosin motor domain.
11468392	Phase changes in T(3)R(3)(f) human insulin: temperature or pressure induced?	The structure of T(3)R(3) hexameric human insulin has been determined at 100 K from two different crystals at 1.2 and 1.3 A resolution and refined to residuals of 0.169 and 0.176, respectively. Owing to a phase change, the c axis is double its room-temperature value and the asymmetric unit contains two independent TR(f) insulin dimers. Compared with the orientation in the room-temperature structure, one dimer undergoes a rotation about the c axis of -5 degrees, while the second is rotated +4 degrees. A superposition of the backbone atoms of the two independent dimers shows that the C(alpha) atoms of five residues within the R(f)-state monomers are displaced by more than 1.0 A; smaller displacements are observed for the T-state monomers. Four zinc ions lie on the crystallographic threefold axis and each forms bonds to three symmetry-related HisB10 N(varepsilon2) atoms from the T- and R(f)-state trimers. While three of the zinc ions are tetrahedrally coordinated with a chloride ion completing the coordination sphere, mixed tetrahedral/octahedral coordination is observed for one of the T-state zinc ions. The three symmetry-related "phenolic binding sites" in one hexamer contain water molecules and a glycerol molecule, but the same sites in the second hexamer are occupied by a zinc ion coordinated to an alternate conformation of HisB10, a symmetry-related HisB5 and two chloride ions. Two additional and partially occupied zinc ion sites are observed at the interface between the two independent dimers. One zinc ion is coordinated by a T-state HisB5 of one dimer, an R-state HisB5 of the second dimer and two water molecules; the second zinc ion is coordinated by an alternate side-chain conformation of the T-state HisB5 and three water molecules. The carboxyl group of one GluB13 side chain, which exists in two discrete conformations, appears to be protonated, because short contacts exist to a second carboxyl group or to a carbonyl O atom.
10211818	Dissection of the structural and functional role of a conserved hydration site in RNase T1.	The reoccurrence of water molecules in crystal structures of RNase T1 was investigated. Five waters were found to be invariant in RNase T1 as well as in six other related fungal RNases. The structural, dynamical, and functional characteristics of one of these conserved hydration sites (WAT1) were analyzed by protein engineering, X-ray crystallography, and (17)O and 2H nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion (NMRD). The position of WAT1 and its surrounding hydrogen bond network are unaffected by deletions of two neighboring side chains. In the mutant Thr93Gln, the Gln93N epsilon2 nitrogen replaces WAT1 and participates in a similar hydrogen bond network involving Cys6, Asn9, Asp76, and Thr91. The ability of WAT1 to form four hydrogen bonds may explain why evolution has preserved a water molecule, rather than a side-chain atom, at the center of this intricate hydrogen bond network. Comparison of the (17)O NMRD profiles from wild-type and Thr93Gln RNase T1 yield a mean residence time of 7 ns at 27 degrees C and an orientational order parameter of 0.45. The effects of mutations around WAT1 on the kinetic parameters of RNase T1 are small but significant and probably relate to the dynamics of the active site.
1560844	Fusarium solani cutinase is a lipolytic enzyme with a catalytic serine accessible to solvent.	Lipases belong to a class of esterases whose activity on triglycerides is greatly enhanced at lipid-water interfaces. This phenomenon, called interfacial activation, has a structural explanation: a hydrophobic lid, which at rest covers the catalytic site, is displaced on substrate or inhibitor binding and probably interacts with the lipid matrix. Fusarium solani pisi cutinase belongs to a group of homologous enzymes of relative molecular mass 22-25K (ref. 7) capable of degrading cutin, the insoluble lipid-polyester matrix covering the surface of plants, and hydrolysing triglycerides. Cutinases differ from classical lipases in that they do not exhibit interfacial activation; they are active on soluble as well as on emulsified triglycerides. Cutinases therefore establish a bridge between esterases and lipases. We report here the three-dimensional structure of a recombinant cutinase from F. solani pisi, expressed in Escherichia coli. Cutinase is an alpha-beta protein; the active site is composed of the triad Ser 120, His 188 and Asp 175. Unlike other lipases, the catalytic serine is not buried under surface loops, but is accessible to solvent. This could explain why cutinase does not display interfacial activation.
15084592	Crystal structure of transglutaminase 3 in complex with GMP: structural basis for nucleotide specificity.	Epidermal-type Transglutaminase 3 (TGase 3) is a Ca(2+)-dependent enzyme involved in the cross-linking of structural proteins required in the assembly of the cell envelope. We have recently shown that calcium-activated TGase 3, like TGase 2, can bind, hydrolyze, and is inhibited by GTP despite lacking structural homology with other GTP-binding proteins. Here we report the crystal structure determined at 2.0 A resolution of TGase 3 in complex with GMP to elucidate the structural features required for nucleotide recognition. Binding affinities for various nucleotides were found by fluorescence displacement to be as follows: guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPgammaS) (0.4 microm), GTP (0.6 microm), GDP (1.0 microm), GMP (0.4 microm), and ATP (28.0 microm). Furthermore, we found that GMP binds as a reversible, noncompetitive inhibitor of TGase 3 transamidation activity, similar to GTPgammaS and GDP. A genetic algorithm similarity program (GASP) approach (virtual ligand screening) identified three compounds from the Lead Quest trade mark data base (Tripos Inc.) based on superimposition of GTPgammaS, GDP, and GMP guanine nucleotides from our crystal structures to generate the minimum align flexible fragment. These three were nucleotide analogs without a phosphate group containing the minimal binding motif for TGase 3 that includes a nucleoside recognition groove. Binding affinities were measured as follows: TP349915 (K(d) = 4.1 microm), TP395289 (K(d) = 38.5 microm), TP394305 (K(d) = 1.0 mm). Remarkably, these compounds do not inhibit but instead activate TGase 3 transamidation by about 10-fold. These results suggest that the nucleotide binding pocket in TGase 3 may be exploited to either enhance or inhibit the enzymatic activity as required for different therapeutic approaches.
9253406	Three-dimensional structure of the Ras-interacting domain of RalGDS.	The Ras-interacting domains of the the protein-kinase Raf and the Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator, RalGDS, lack extensive sequence similarity, but their overall three-dimensional structures are very similar to each other. Mutational analysis indicated that three residues in the RalGDS domain are critical for its interaction with Ras.
3018924	The site of attachment in human rhinovirus 14 for antiviral agents that inhibit uncoating.	WIN 51711 and WIN 52084 are structurally related, antiviral compounds that inhibit the replication of rhino (common cold) viruses and related picornaviruses. They prevent the pH-mediated uncoating of the viral RNA. The compounds consist of a 3-methylisoxazole group that inserts itself into the hydrophobic interior of the VP1 beta-barrel, a connecting seven-membered aliphatic chain, and a 4-oxazolinylphenoxy group (OP) that covers the entrance to an ion channel in the floor of the "canyon." Viral disassembly may be inhibited by preventing the collapse of the VP1 hydrophobic pocket or by blocking the flow of ions into the virus interior.
12578370	Dynamic roles of arginine residues 82 and 92 of Escherichia coli 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase: crystallographic studies.	6-Hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase (HPPK) catalyzes the pyrophosphoryl transfer from ATP to 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin (HP), the first reaction in the folate biosynthetic pathway. Arginine residues 82 and 92, strictly conserved in 35 HPPK sequences, play dynamic roles in the catalytic cycle of the enzyme. At 0.89-A resolution, two distinct conformations are observed for each of the two residues in the crystal structure of the wild-type HPPK in complex with two HP variants, two Mg(2+) ions, and an ATP analogue. Structural information suggests that R92 first binds to the alpha-phosphate group of ATP and then shifts to interact with the beta-phosphate as R82, which initially does not bind to ATP, moves in and binds to alpha-phosphate when the pyrophosphoryl transfer is about to occur. The dynamic roles of R82 and R92 are further elucidated by five more crystal structures of two mutant proteins, R82A and R92A, with and without bound ligands. Two oxidized forms of HP are observed with an occupancy ratio of 0.50:0.50 in the 0.89-A structure. The oxidation of HP has significant impact on its binding to the protein as well as the conformation of nearby residue W89.
3329733	Proteases of enhanced stability: characterization of a thermostable variant of subtilisin.	A procedure has been developed for the isolation and identification of mutants in the bacterial serine protease subtilisin that exhibit enhanced thermal stability. The cloned subtilisin BPN' gene from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens was treated with bisulfite, a chemical mutagen that deaminates cytosine to uracil in single-stranded DNA. Strains containing the cloned, mutagenized subtilisin gene which produced subtilisin with enhanced thermal stability were selected by a simple plate assay procedure which screens for esterase activity on nitrocellulose filters after preincubation at elevated temperatures. One thermostable subtilisin variant, designated 7150, has been fully characterized and found to differ from wild-type subtilisin by a single substitution of Ser for Asn at position 218. The 7150 enzyme was found to undergo thermal inactivation at one-fourth the rate of the wild-type enzyme when incubated at elevated temperatures. Moreover, the mid-point in the thermally induced transition from the folded to unfolded state was found to be 2.4-3.9 degrees C higher for 7150 as determined by differential scanning calorimetry under a variety of conditions. The refined, 1.8-A crystal structures of the wild-type and 7150 subtilisin have been compared in detail, leading to the conclusion that slight improvements in hydrogen bond parameters in the vicinity of position 218 result in the enhanced thermal stability of 7150.
7827089	Three-dimensional solution structure of the N-terminal receiver domain of NTRC.	NTRC is a transcriptional enhancer binding protein whose N-terminal domain is a member of the family of receiver domains of two-component regulatory systems. Using 3D and 4D NMR spectroscopy, we have completed the 1H, 15N, and 13C assignments and determined the solution structure of the N-terminal receiver domain of the NTRC protein. Determination of the three-dimensional structure was carried out with the program X-PLOR (Br|nger, 1992) using a total of 915 NMR-derived distance and dihedral angle restraints. The resultant family of structures has an average root mean square deviation of 0.81 A from the average structure for the backbone atoms involved in well-defined secondary structure. The structure is comprised of five alpha-helices and a five-stranded parallel beta-sheet, in a (beta/alpha)5 topology. Comparison of the solution structure of the NTRC receiver domain with the crystal structures of the homologous protein CheY in both the Mg(2+)-free and Mg(2+)-bound forms [Stock, A.M., Mottonen, J. M., Stock, J. B., & Schutt, C. E. (1989) Nature 337, 745-749; Volz, K., & Matsumura, P. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 296, 15511-15519; Stock, A. M., Martinez-Hackert, E., Rasmussen, B. F., West, A. H., Stock, J. B., Ringe, D., & Petsko, G. A. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 13375-13380; Bellsolell, L., Prieto, J., Serrano, L., & Coll, M. (1994) J. Mol. Biol. 238, 489-495] reveals a very similar fold, with the only significant difference occurring in the positioning of helix 4 relative to the rest of the protein. Examination of the conformation of consensus residues of the receiver domain superfamily [Volz, K. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 11741-11753] in the structures of the NTRC receiver domain and CheY establishes the structural importance of residues whose side chains are involved in hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic core interactions. The importance of some nonconsensus residues which may be conserved for their ability to fulfill helix capping roles is also discussed.

8289287	High-resolution crystallographic analysis of a co-operative dimeric hemoglobin.	High-resolution crystal structures of the co-operative dimeric hemoglobin from the blood clam Scapharca inaequivalvis have been determined in the unliganded (deoxy) and carbon monoxide (CO) liganded states. The deoxy structure has been refined at 1.6 A resolution to an R-factor of 0.158 and the CO structure has been refined at 1.4 A resolution to an R-factor of 0.159. These structures reveal details of the structural transitions involved in co-operative ligand binding that involve only a minor rotation of subunits but very striking tertiary changes at the interface. A small number of residues in the F-helix appear to mediate co-operativity in this simple hemoglobin. The oxygen affinity of each subunit appears to be largely dictated by the disposition of phenylalanine 97, whose side-chain packs in the heme pocket in the deoxy state but is extruded towards the interface in the CO-liganded structure. Direct involvement of the ligand-binding heme group is a novel feature of the subunit interface and appears important for intersubunit communication. Ligation alters the conformation of the heme propionate groups along with two interacting residues from the symmetry-related subunit. These two residues, lysine 96 and asparagine 100, link the heme of one subunit with the F-helix of the second subunit in such a way as to influence the ligand affinity of that subunit. The interface is highly hydrated by well-ordered water molecules that are likely to be important in the stabilization of the two structures.
9514755	Generation of ligand binding sites in T4 lysozyme by deficiency-creating substitutions.	Several variants of T4 lysozyme have been identified that sequester small organic ligands in cavities or clefts. To evaluate potential binding sites for non-polar molecules, we screened a number of hydrophobic large-to-small mutants for stabilization in the presence of benzene. In addition to Leu99-->Ala, binding was indicated for at least five other mutants. Variants Met102-->Ala and Leu133-->Gly, and a crevice mutant, Phe104-->Ala, were further characterized using X-ray crystallography and thermal denaturation. As predicted from the shape of the cavity in the benzene complex, mutant Leu133-->Gly also bound p-xylene. We attempted to enlarge the cavity of the Met102-->Ala mutant into a deep crevice through an additional substitution, but the double mutant failed to bind ligands because an adjacent helix rearranged into a non-helical structure, apparently due to the loss of packing interactions. In general, the protein structure contracted slightly to reduce the volume of the void created by truncating substitutions and expanded upon binding the non-polar ligand, with shifts similar to those resulting from the mutations.A polar molecule binding site was also created by truncating Arg95 to alanine. This creates a highly complementary buried polar environment that can be utilized as a specific "receptor" for a guanidinium ion. Our results suggest that creating a deficiency through truncating mutations of buried residues generates "binding potential" for ligands with characteristics similar to the deleted side-chain. Analysis of complex and apo crystal structures of binding and non-binding mutants suggests that ligand size and shape as well as protein flexibility and complementarity are all determinants of binding. Binding at non-polar sites is governed by hydrophobicity and steric interactions and is relatively permissive. Binding at a polar site is more restrictive and requires extensive complementarity between the ligand and the site.
15276844	X-ray and thermodynamic studies of staphylococcal nuclease variants I92E and I92K: insights into polarity of the protein interior.	We have used crystallography and thermodynamic analysis to study nuclease variants I92E and I92K, in which an ionizable side-chain is placed in the hydrophobic core of nuclease. We find that the energetic cost of burying ionizable groups is rather modest. The X-ray determinations show water molecules solvating the buried glutamic acid under cryo conditions, but not at room temperature. The lysine side-chain does not appear solvated in either case. Guanidine hydrochloride (GnHCl) denaturation of I92E and I92K, done as a function of pH and monitored by tryptophan fluorescence, showed that I92E and I92K are folded in the pH range pH 3.5-9.0 and pH 5.5-9.5, respectively. The stability of the parental protein is independent of pH over a broad range. In contrast, the stabilities of I92E and I92K exhibit a pH dependence, which is quantitatively explained by thermodynamic analysis: the PK(a) value of the buried K92 is 5.6, while that of the buried E92 is 8.65. The free energy difference between burying the uncharged and charged forms of the groups is modest, about 6 kcal/mol. We also found that epsilon(app) for I92K and I92E is in the range approximately 10-12, instead of 2-4 commonly used to represent the protein interior. Side-chains 92E and 92K were uncharged under the conditions of the X-ray experiment. Both are buried completely inside the well-defined hydrophobic core of the variant proteins without forming salt-bridges or hydrogen bonds to other functional groups of the proteins. Under cryo conditions 92E shows a chain of four water molecules, which hydrate one oxygen atom of the carboxyl group of the glutamic acid. Two other water molecules, which are present in the wild-type at all temperatures, are also connected to the water ring observed inside the hydrophobic core. The ready burial of water with an uncharged E92 raises the possibility that solvent excursions into the interior also take place in the wild-type protein, but in a random, dynamic way not detectable by crystallography. Such transient excursions could increase the average polarity, and thus epsilon(app), of the protein interior.
7523679	Crystals of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase diffracting to 2.2 A resolution.	Reverse transcriptase (RT) from the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 has been crystallized in four closely related forms, the best of which diffract X-rays to 2.2 A resolution. The RT was crystallized as a complex with a non-nucleoside inhibitor, either nevirapine or a nevirapine analogue. Crystals grew from 6% PEG 3400 buffered at pH 5. These were of space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) with unit cell parameters a = 147 A, b = 112 A, c = 79 A (form A), with one RT heterodimer in the asymmetric unit. Changes in unit cell parameters and degree of crystalline order were observed on soaking pregrown crystals in various solutions, giving three further sets of unit cells. These were a = 143 A, b = 112, A, c = 79 A (form B), a = 141 A, b = 111 A, c = 73 A (form C), a = 143 A, b = 117 A, c = 66.5 A (form D). The last two forms diffract X-rays to 2.2 A resolution. Structure determinations of these latter crystal forms of RT should give a detailed atomic model for this therapeutically important drug target.
9587003	Crystal structure of a novel human peroxidase enzyme at 2.0 A resolution.	Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has been implicated recently as an intracellular messenger that affects cellular processes including protein phosphorylation, transcription and apoptosis. A set of novel peroxidases, named peroxiredoxins (Prx), regulate the intracellular concentration of H2O2 by reducing it in the presence of an appropriate electron donor. The crystal structure of a human Prx enzyme, hORF6, reveals that the protein contains two discrete domains and forms a dimer. The N-terminal domain has a thioredoxin fold and the C-terminal domain is used for dimerization. The active site cysteine (Cys 47), which exists as cysteine-sulfenic acid in the crystal, is located at the bottom of a relatively narrow pocket. The positively charged environment surrounding Cys 47 accounts for the peroxidase activity of the enzyme, which contains no redox cofactors.
9799500	The hydroxyl of threonine 13 of the bovine 70-kDa heat shock cognate protein is essential for transducing the ATP-induced conformational change.	The mechanism by which ATP binding transduces a conformational change in 70-kDa heat shock proteins that results in release of bound peptides remains obscure. Wei and Hendershot demonstrated that mutating Thr37 of hamster BiP to glycine impeded the ATP-induced conformational change, as monitored by proteolysis [(1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 26670-26676]. We have mutated the equivalent resitude of the bovine heat shock cognate protein (Hsc70), Thr13, to serine, valine, and glycine. Solution small-angle X-ray scattering experiments on a 60-kDa fragment of Hsc70 show that ATP binding induces a conformational change in the T13S mutant but not the T13V or T13G mutants. The kinetics of ATP-induced tryptophan fluorescence intensity changes in the 60-kDa proteins is biphasic for the T13S mutant but monophasic for T13V or T13G, consistent with a conformational change following initial ATP binding in the T13S mutant but not the other two. Crystallographic structures of the ATPase fragments of the T13S and T13G mutants at 1.7 A resolution show that the mutations do not disrupt the ATP binding site and that the serine hydroxyl mimics the threonine hydroxyl in the wild-type structure. We conclude that the hydroxyl of Thr13 is essential for coupling ATP binding to a conformational change in Hsc70. Molecular modeling suggests this may result from the threonine hydroxyl hydrogen-bonding to a gamma-phosphate oxygen of ATP, thereby inducing a structural shift within the ATPase domain that couples to its interactions with the peptide binding domain.
12869558	Crystal structure of human butyrylcholinesterase and of its complexes with substrate and products.	Cholinesterases are among the most efficient enzymes known. They are divided into two groups: acetylcholinesterase, involved in the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and butyrylcholinesterase of unknown function. Several crystal structures of the former have shown that the active site is located at the bottom of a deep and narrow gorge, raising the question of how substrate and products enter and leave. Human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) has attracted attention because it can hydrolyze toxic esters such as cocaine or scavenge organophosphorus pesticides and nerve agents. Here we report the crystal structures of several recombinant truncated human BChE complexes and conjugates and provide a description for mechanistically relevant non-productive substrate and product binding. As expected, the structure of BChE is similar to a previously published theoretical model of this enzyme and to the structure of Torpedo acetylcholinesterase. The main difference between the experimentally determined BChE structure and its model is found at the acyl binding pocket that is significantly bigger than expected. An electron density peak close to the catalytic Ser(198) has been modeled as bound butyrate.
7966307	Refined X-ray structure of Dictyostelium discoideum nucleoside diphosphate kinase at 1.8 A resolution.	The X-ray structure of the nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDP kinase) from Dictyostelium discoideum has been refined at 1.8 A resolution from a hexagonal crystal form with a 17 kDa monomer in its asymmetric unit. The atomic model was derived from the previously determined structure of a point mutant of the protein. It contains 150 amino acid residues out of 155, and 95 solvent molecules. The R-factor is 0.196 and the estimated accuracy of the average atomic position, 0.25 A. The Dictyostelium structure is described in detail and compared to those of Drosophila and Myxococcus xanthus NDP kinases. The protein is a hexamer with D3 symmetry. Residues 8 to 138 of each subunit form a globular alpha/beta domain. The four-stranded beta-sheet is antiparallel; its topology is different from other phosphate transfer enzymes, and also from the HPr protein which, like NDP kinase, carries a phosphorylated histidine. The same topology is nevertheless found in several other proteins that bind mononucleotides, RNA or DNA. Strand connections in NDP kinase involve alpha-helices and a 20-residue segment called the Kpn loop. The beta-sheet is regular except for a beta-bulge in edge strand beta 2 and a gamma-turn at residue Ile120 just preceding strand beta 4. The latter may induce strain in the main chain near the active site His122. The alpha 1 beta 2 motif participates in forming dimers within the hexamer, helices alpha 1 and alpha 3, the Kpn loop and C terminus, in forming trimers. The subunit fold and dimer interactions found in Dictyostelium are conserved in other NDP kinases. Trimer interactions probably occur in all eukaryotic enzymes. They are absent in the bacterial Myxococcus xanthus enzyme which is a tetramer, even though the subunit structure is very similar. In Dictyostelium, contacts between Kpn loops near the 3-fold axis block access to a central cavity lined with polar residues and filled with well-defined solvent molecules. Biochemical data on point mutants highlight the contribution of the Kpn loop to protein stability. In Myxococcus, the Kpn loops are on the tetramer surface and their sequence is poorly conserved. Yet, their conformation is maintained and they make a similar contribution to the substrate binding site.
10404591	Crystal structure of human bleomycin hydrolase, a self-compartmentalizing cysteine protease.	BACKGROUND: Bleomycin hydrolase (BH) is a cysteine protease that is found in all tissues in mammals as well as in many other eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Although its conserved cellular function is as yet unknown, human bleomycin hydrolase (hBH) has clinical significance in that it is thought to be the major cause of tumor cell resistance to bleomycin chemotherapy. In addition, it has been reported that an allelic variant of hBH is genetically linked to Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS: We have determined the crystal structures of wild-type hBH and of a mutant form of the enzyme. The overall structure is very similar to that of the previously determined yeast homolog, however, there is a striking difference in the charge distribution. The central channel, which has a strong positive electrostatic potential in the yeast protein, is slightly negative in hBH. We have determined that hBH does not have the DNA-binding activity of the yeast protein and that the enzyme is localized to the cytoplasm. CONCLUSIONS: The difference in charge distribution between the yeast and human BH enzymes is most likely responsible for the difference in DNA-binding activity. Nevertheless, the C-terminal autoprocessing activity and the role of the C terminus as a determinant for peptidase activity are conserved between the yeast and human forms. The structure of hBH suggests that the putative Alzheimer's disease linked variation does not directly alter the intrinsic peptidase activity. Rather, the position of the mutation suggests that it could affect interactions with another protein, which may modulate peptidase activity through repositioning of the C terminus.
6372857	Critical role of the A2 amino acid residue in the biological activity of insulin: [2-glycine-A]- and [2-alanine-A]insulins.	We report the synthesis of [2-glycine-A]insulin ([ Gly2 -A]insulin) and [2-alanine-A]insulin ([ Ala2-A]insulin) in which the indicated amino acid has been substituted for isoleucine found in this position in the natural hormone. The circular dichroic (CD) spectra of the analogues were obtained, and their properties were examined in several biological assays. CD studies suggested that the analogues remain monomeric at concentrations at which insulin is partly or mostly dimeric. Both analogues are extremely weak full agonists. [ Gly2 -A]-insulin displays 0.05% of the potency of bovine insulin, whereas [Ala2-A]insulin assays at 0.4% of the activity of the natural hormone. We conclude that the presence of the side chain of isoleucine at position A2 is a critical requirement for high biological activity in insulin. The data, together with previous observations, are discussed in connection with an interaction between the side chain of isoleucine-A2 and the phenolic ring system of tyrosine-A19, which are in van der Waals contact in crystalline insulin. This interaction may be required to permit the molecule to assume a conformation consistent with dimerization and with binding to the insulin receptor.
9930994	Effects of the E177K mutation in D-amino acid transaminase. Studies on an essential coenzyme anchoring group that contributes to stereochemical fidelity.	D-Amino acid transaminase is a bacterial enzyme that uses pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) as a cofactor to catalyze the conversion of D-amino acids into their corresponding alpha-keto acids. This enzyme has already been established as a target for novel antibacterial agents through suicide inactivation by a number of compounds. To improve their potency and specificity, the detailed enzyme mechanism, especially the role of its PLP cofactor, is under investigation. Many PLP-dependent transaminases have a negatively charged amino acid residue forming a salt-bridge with the pyridine nitrogen of its cofactor that promotes its protonation to stabilize the formation of a ketimine intermediate, which is subsequently hydrolyzed in the normal transaminase reaction pathway. However, alanine racemase has a positively charged arginine held rigidly in place by an extensive hydrogen bond network that may destabilize the ketimine intermediate, and make it too short-lived for a transaminase type of hydrolysis to occur. To test this hypothesis, we changed Glu-177 into a titratable, positively charged lysine (E177K). The crystal structure of this mutant shows that the positive charge of the newly introduced lysine side chain points away from the nitrogen of the cofactor, which may be due to electrostatic repulsions not being overcome by a hydrogen bond network such as found in alanine racemase. This mutation makes the active site more accessible, as exemplified by both biochemical and crystallographic data: CD measurements indicated a change in the microenvironment of the protein, some SH groups become more easily titratable, and at pH 9.0 the PMP peak appeared around 315 nm rather than at 330 nm. The ability of this mutant to convert L-alanine into D-alanine increased about 10-fold compared to wild-type and to about the same extent as found with other active site mutants. On the other hand, the specific activity of the E177K mutant decreased more than 1000-fold compared to wild-type. Furthermore, titration with L-alanine resulted in the appearance of an enzyme-substrate quinonoid intermediate absorbing around 500 nm, which is not observed with usual substrates or with the wild-type enzyme in the presence of L-alanine. The results overall indicate the importance of charged amino acid side chains relative to the coenzyme to maintain high catalytic efficiency.
9641984	Multiple open forms of ribose-binding protein trace the path of its conformational change.	Conformational changes are necessary for the function of bacterial periplasmic receptors in chemotaxis and transport. Such changes allow entry and exit of ligand, and enable the correct interaction of the ligand-bound proteins with the membrane components of each system. Three open, ligand-free forms of the Escherichia coli ribose-binding protein were observed here by X-ray crystallographic studies. They are opened by 43 degrees, 50 degrees and 64 degrees with respect to the ligand-bound protein reported previously. The three open forms are not distinct, but show a clear relationship to each other. All are the product of a similar opening motion, and are stabilized by a new, almost identical packing interface between the domains. The changes are generated by similar bond rotations, although some differences in the three hinge segments are needed to accommodate the various structural scenarios. Some local repacking also occurs as interdomain contacts are lost. The least open (43 degrees) form is probably the dominant one in solution under normal conditions, although a mixture of species seems likely. The open and closed forms have distinct surfaces in the regions known to be important in chemotaxis and transport, which will differentiate their interactions with the membrane components. It seems certain that the conformational path that links the forms described here is that followed during ligand retrieval, and in ligand release into the membrane-bound permease system.
15369336	Enhanced degradation of chemical warfare agents through molecular engineering of the phosphotriesterase active site.	null
14508061	A model for the reaction mechanism of the transglutaminase 3 enzyme.	Transglutaminase enzymes (TGases) catalyze the calcium dependent formation of an isopeptide bond between protein-bound glutamine and lysine substrates. Previously we have shown that activated TGase 3 acquires two additional calcium ions at site two and three. The calcium ion at site three results in the opening of a channel. At this site, the channel opening and closing could modulate, depending on which metal is bound. Here we propose that the front of the channel could be used by the two substrates for enzyme reaction. We propose that the glutamine substrate is directed from Trp236 into the enzyme, shown by molecular docking. Then a lysine substrate approaches the opened active site to engage Trp327, leading to formation of the isopeptide bond. Further, direct comparisons of the structures of TGase 3 with other TGases have allowed us to identify several residues that might potentially be involved in generic and specific recognition of the glutamine and lysine substrates.
10310546	Five years of ACCESS: what have we learned?	null
11210138	Analysis of catalytic residues of Thermoactinomyces vulgaris R-47 alpha-amylase II (TVA II) by site-directed mutagenesis.	To confirm that the catalytic residues (Asp325, Glu354, and Asp421) are necessary for the hydrolysis of starch, pullulan, and cyclodextrins, we constructed TVA II mutated by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutated enzymes (D325N, E354Q, and D421N) had markedly reduced levels of activity, less than 0.006% of the wild type, indicating that these three residues are the catalytic sites for these substrates. Even E354D had reduced levels of activity, less than 0.05% of wild type. These four mutated enzymes retained a trace of activity. From the result of hydrolysis patterns for maltohexaose, in particular, D421N, unlike D325N and E354Q, catalyzed transglycosylation rather than hydrolysis. The results suggest that Asp421 could function to capture water molecules.
16185060	Crystal structure of Thermobifida fusca endoglucanase Cel6A in complex with substrate and inhibitor: the role of tyrosine Y73 in substrate ring distortion.	Endoglucanase Cel6A from Thermobifida fusca hydrolyzes the beta-1,4 linkages in cellulose at accessible points along the polymer. The structure of the catalytic domain of Cel6A from T. fusca in complex with a nonhydrolysable substrate analogue that acts as an inhibitor, methylcellobiosyl-4-thio-beta-cellobioside (Glc(2)-S-Glc(2)), has been determined to 1.5 A resolution. The glycosyl unit in subsite -1 was sterically hindered by Tyr73 and forced into a distorted (2)S(o) conformation. In the enzyme where Tyr73 was mutated to a serine residue, the hindrance was removed and the glycosyl unit in subsite -1 had a relaxed (4)C(1) chair conformation. The relaxed conformation was seen in two complex structures of the mutated enzyme, with cellotetrose (Glc(4)) at 1.64 A and Glc(2)-S-Glc(2) at 1.04 A resolution.
7583653	Structure-based design of a lysozyme with altered catalytic activity.	Here we show that the substitution Thr 26-->His in the active site of T4 lysozyme causes the product to change from the alpha- to the beta-anomer. This implies an alteration in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. From the change in product, together with inspection of relevant crystal structures, it is inferred that wild-type T4 lysozyme is an anomer-inverting enzyme with a single displacement mechanism in which water attacks from the alpha-side of the substrate. In contrast, the mutant T26H is an anomer-retaining enzyme with an apparently double displacement mechanism in which a water molecule attacks from the opposite side of the substrate. The results also show that the mechanism of wild-type T4 lysozyme differs from that of hen egg-white lysozyme even though both enzymes are presumed to have evolved from a common precursor.
15981999	Structural consequences of the inhibitor-resistant Ser130Gly substitution in TEM beta-lactamase.	Beta-lactamase confers resistance to penicillin-like antibiotics by hydrolyzing their beta-lactam bond. To combat these enzymes, inhibitors covalently cross-linking the hydrolytic Ser70 to Ser130 were introduced. In turn, mutant beta-lactamases have emerged with decreased susceptibility to these mechanism-based inhibitors. Substituting Ser130 with glycine in the inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT) mutant TEM-76 (S130G) prevents the irreversible cross-linking step. Since the completely conserved Ser130 is thought to transfer a proton important for catalysis, its substitution might be hypothesized to result in a nonfunctional enzyme; this is clearly not the case. To investigate how TEM-76 remains active, its structure was determined by X-ray crystallography to 1.40 A resolution. A new water molecule (Wat1023) is observed in the active site, with two configurations located 1.1 and 1.3 A from the missing Ser130 Ogamma; this water molecule likely replaces the Ser130 side-chain hydroxyl in substrate hydrolysis. Intriguingly, this same water molecule is seen in the IRT TEM-32 (M69I/M182T), where Ser130 has moved significantly. TEM-76 shares other structural similarities with various IRTs; like TEM-30 (R244S) and TEM-84 (N276D), the water molecule activating clavulanate for cross-linking (Wat1614) is disordered (in TEM-30 it is actually absent). As expected, TEM-76 has decreased kinetic activity, likely due to the replacement of the Ser130 side-chain hydroxyl with a water molecule. In contrast to the recently determined structure of the S130G mutant in the related SHV-1 beta-lactamase, in TEM-76 the key hydrolytic water (Wat1561) is still present. The conservation of similar accommodations among IRT mutants suggests that resistance arises from common mechanisms, despite the disparate locations of the various substitutions.
10842338	NMR investigations of protein-carbohydrate interactions: studies on the relevance of Trp/Tyr variations in lectin binding sites as deduced from titration microcalorimetry and NMR studies on hevein domains. Determination of the NMR structure of the complex between pseudohevein and N,N',N"-triacetylchitotriose.	Model studies on lectins and their interactions with carbohydrate ligands in solution are essential to gain insights into the driving forces for complex formation and to optimize programs for computer simulations. The specific interaction of pseudohevein with N,N', N"-triacetylchitotriose has been analyzed by (1)H-NMR spectroscopy. Because of its small size, with a chain length of 45 amino acids, this lectin is a prime target to solution-structure determination by NOESY NMR experiments in water. The NMR-analysis was extended to assessment of the topology of the complex between pseudohevein and N, N',N"-triacetylchitotriose. NOESY experiments in water solution provided 342 protein proton-proton distance constraints. Binding of the ligand did not affect the pattern of the protein nuclear Overhauser effect signal noticeably, what would otherwise be indicative of a ligand-induced conformational change. The average backbone (residues 3-41) RMSD of the 20 refined structures was 1.14 A, whereas the heavy atom RMSD was 2.18 A. Two different orientations of the trisaccharide within the pseudohevein binding site are suggested, furnishing an explanation in structural terms for the lectin's capacity to target chitin. In both cases, hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts confer stability to the complexes. This conclusion is corroborated by the thermodynamic parameters of binding determined by NMR and isothermal titration calorimetry. The association process was enthalpically driven. In relation to hevein, the Trp/Tyr-substitution in the binding pocket has only a small effect on the free energy of binding in contrast to engineered galectin-1 and a mammalian C-type lectin. A comparison of the three-dimensional structure of pseudohevein in solution to those reported for wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) in the solid state and for hevein and WGA-B in solution has been performed, providing a data source about structural variability of the hevein domains. The experimentally derived structures and the values of the solvent accessibilities for several key residues have also been compared with conformations obtained by molecular dynamics simulations, pointing to the necessity to further refine the programs to enhance their predictive reliability and, thus, underscoring the importance of this kind of combined analysis in model systems.
15163634	Mutant huntingtin directly increases susceptibility of mitochondria to the calcium-induced permeability transition and cytochrome c release.	Huntington's disease (HD) is initiated by an abnormally expanded polyglutamine stretch in the huntingtin protein, conferring a novel property on the protein that leads to the loss of striatal neurons. Defects in mitochondrial function have been implicated in the pathogenesis of HD. Here, we have examined the hypothesis that the mutant huntingtin protein may directly interact with the mitochondrion and affect its function. In human neuroblastoma cells and clonal striatal cells established from HdhQ7 (wild-type) and HdhQ111 (mutant) homozygote mouse knock-in embryos, huntingtin was present in a purified mitochondrial fraction. Subfractionation of the mitochondria and limited trypsin digestion of the organelle demonstrated that huntingtin was associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane. We further demonstrated that a recombinant truncated mutant huntingtin protein, but not a wild-type, directly induced mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore opening in isolated mouse liver mitochondria, an effect that was prevented completely by cyclosporin A (CSA) and ATP. Importantly, the mutant huntingtin protein significantly decreased the Ca2+ threshold necessary to trigger MPT pore opening. We found a similar increased susceptibility to the calcium-induced MPT in liver mitochondria isolated from a knock-in HD mouse model. The mutant huntingtin protein-induced MPT pore opening was accompanied by a significant release of cytochrome c, an effect completely inhibited by CSA. These findings suggest that the development of specific MPT inhibitors may be an interesting therapeutic avenue to delay the onset of HD.
11602602	Structural basis for Ni(2+) transport and assembly of the urease active site by the metallochaperone UreE from Bacillus pasteurii.	Bacillus pasteurii UreE (BpUreE) is a putative chaperone assisting the insertion of Ni(2+) ions in the active site of urease. The x-ray structure of the protein has been determined for two crystal forms, at 1.7 and 1.85 A resolution, using SIRAS phases derived from a Hg(2+)-derivative. BpUreE is composed of distinct N- and C-terminal domains, connected by a short flexible linker. The structure reveals the topology of an elongated homodimer, formed by interaction of the two C-terminal domains through hydrophobic interactions. A single Zn(2+) ion bound to four conserved His-100 residues, one from each monomer, connects two dimers resulting in a tetrameric BpUreE known to be formed in concentrated solutions. The Zn(2+) ion can be replaced by Ni(2+) as shown by anomalous difference maps obtained on a crystal of BpUreE soaked in a solution containing NiCl(2). A large hydrophobic patch surrounding the metal ion site is surface-exposed in the biologically relevant dimer. The BpUreE structure represents the first for this class of proteins and suggests a possible role for UreE in the urease nickel-center assembly.
7473737	Mutations at positions 153 and 328 in Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase provide insight towards the structure and function of mammalian and yeast alkaline phosphatases.	In order to understand some of the differences between human placental, human, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatases in specific activity, activation by magnesium, and pH versus activity profiles, the X-ray crystal structures of three mutant E. coli alkaline phosphatases have been determined. The aligned sequences of alkaline phosphatases from mammalian, yeast and E. coli show that 25 to 30% of the amino acids are absolutely conserved and the active site residues are completely conserved with the exception of residues 153, 328 and 155. The bacterial enzyme has a salt-bridge, Asp153/Lys328, near the third metal binding site which, based on sequence homology, is apparently absent in the yeast and mammalian enzymes. The human enzymes have histidine at positions 153 and 328, and the yeast enzyme has histidine at position 328. In the E. coli enzyme, Asp153 was replaced by histidine (D153H), Lys328 was replaced by histidine (K328H), and a double mutant (DM) was constructed containing both mutations. The structure of the K328H enzyme was refined using cross-validation to a resolution of 2.3 A with a working R-factor of 0.181 and a free R-factor of 0.249. The DM structure was determined to a resolution of 2.5 A with a working R-factor of 0.166 and a free R-factor of 0.233. The structure of the D135H enzyme, which has been reported to a resolution of 2.4 A, has been re-refined using cross-validation to a working R-factor of 0.179 and a free R-factor of 0.239 for controlled comparisons with the two new structures. In all three structures the most significant changes are related to the bound phosphate inhibitor and the identity of the metal ion in the third binding site. The changes in the position of the phosphate group and the alterations at the third metal binding site indicate the structural basis for the variations in the steady-state kinetic parameters previously reported for these enzymes.
12893935	Structure and mechanism of the lactose permease of Escherichia coli.	Membrane transport proteins that transduce free energy stored in electrochemical ion gradients into a concentration gradient are a major class of membrane proteins. We report the crystal structure at 3.5 angstroms of the Escherichia coli lactose permease, an intensively studied member of the major facilitator superfamily of transporters. The molecule is composed of N- and C-terminal domains, each with six transmembrane helices, symmetrically positioned within the permease. A large internal hydrophilic cavity open to the cytoplasmic side represents the inward-facing conformation of the transporter. The structure with a bound lactose homolog, beta-D-galactopyranosyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside, reveals the sugar-binding site in the cavity, and residues that play major roles in substrate recognition and proton translocation are identified. We propose a possible mechanism for lactose/proton symport (co-transport) consistent with both the structure and a large body of experimental data.
1948029	X-ray structure of the GCN4 leucine zipper, a two-stranded, parallel coiled coil.	The x-ray crystal structure of a peptide corresponding to the leucine zipper of the yeast transcriptional activator GCN4 has been determined at 1.8 angstrom resolution. The peptide forms a parallel, two-stranded coiled coil of alpha helices packed as in the "knobs-into-holes" model proposed by Crick in 1953. Contacts between the helices include ion pairs and an extensive hydrophobic interface that contains a distinctive hydrogen bond. The conserved leucines, like the residues in the alternate hydrophobic repeat, make side-to-side interactions (as in a handshake) in every other layer of the dimer interface. The crystal structure of the GCN4 leucine zipper suggests a key role for the leucine repeat, but also shows how other features of the coiled coil contribute to dimer formation.
10884355	Host range and variability of calcium binding by surface loops in the capsids of canine and feline parvoviruses.	Canine parvovirus (CPV) emerged in 1978 as a host range variant of feline panleukopenia virus (FPV). This change of host was mediated by the mutation of five residues on the surface of the capsid. CPV and FPV enter cells by endocytosis and can be taken up by many non-permissive cell lines, showing that their host range and tissue specificity are largely determined by events occurring after cell entry.We have determined the structures of a variety of strains of CPV and FPV at various pH values and in the presence or absence of Ca(2+). The largest structural difference was found to occur in a flexible surface loop, consisting of residues 359 to 375 of the capsid protein. This loop binds a divalent calcium ion in FPV and is adjacent to a double Ca(2+)-binding site, both in CPV and FPV. Residues within the loop and those associated with the double Ca(2+)-binding site were found to be essential for virus infectivity. The residues involved in the double Ca(2+)-binding site are conserved only in FPV and CPV.Our results show that the loop conformation and the associated Ca(2+)-binding are influenced by the Ca(2+) concentration, as well as pH. These changes are correlated with the ability of the virus to hemagglutinate erythrocytes. The co-localization of hemagglutinating activity and host range determinants on the virus surface implies that these properties may be functionally linked. We speculate that the flexible loop and surrounding regions are involved in binding an as yet unidentified host molecule and that this interaction influences host range.
2269428	Lethal and temperature-sensitive mutations and their suppressors identify an essential structural element in U2 small nuclear RNA.	U2 snRNA is an essential component of the splicing apparatus in eukaryotic cells. Three possible secondary structures for the highly conserved 5' half of U2 snRNA are consistent with U2 phylogenetic sequence variation. To distinguish among these models and to test the function of U2 structural elements, we made greater than 35 mutations in the yeast U2 snRNA gene. Some of the mutations were designed in pairs so that combinations could be made that would restore base-pairing to differentiate helix requirements from primary sequence requirements. The mutations identify an essential stem-and-loop structure adjacent to the branchpoint interaction region. A conserved complementarity to the loop just upstream of the Sm site and an additional conserved stem-loop are dispensable for U2 function, even in the background of a previously identified large internal deletion. Non-Watson-Crick base appositions at the 53-62 base pair in the essential stem lead to a variety of temperature and KCl-sensitive phenotypes, as well as an accumulation of unspliced precursors in vivo. Chemical structure probing of U2 RNA in vivo reveals that the bulk of U2 in a yeast cell adopts a structure in good agreement with that deduced from genetic results. We suggest that this stem-loop is not a binding site for an intrinsic U2 snRNP protein but may interact with other factors during spliceosome assembly or splicing.
9300481	Crystal structures of bovine chymotrypsin and trypsin complexed to the inhibitor domain of Alzheimer's amyloid beta-protein precursor (APPI) and basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI): engineering of inhibitors with altered specificities.	The crystal structures of the inhibitor domain of Alzheimer's amyloid beta-protein precursor (APPI) complexed to bovine chymotrypsin (C-APPI) and trypsin (T-APPI) and basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) bound to chymotrypsin (C-BPTI) have been solved and analyzed at 2.1 A, 1.8 A, and 2.6 A resolution, respectively. APPI and BPTI belong to the Kunitz family of inhibitors, which is characterized by a distinctive tertiary fold with three conserved disulfide bonds. At the specificity-determining site of these inhibitors (P1), residue 15(I)4 is an arginine in APPI and a lysine in BPTI, residue types that are counter to the chymotryptic hydrophobic specificity. In the chymotrypsin complexes, the Arg and Lys P1 side chains of the inhibitors adopt conformations that bend away from the bottom of the binding pocket to interact productively with elements of the binding pocket other than those observed for specificity-matched P1 side chains. The stereochemistry of the nucleophilic hydroxyl of Ser 195 in chymotrypsin relative to the scissile P1 bond of the inhibitors is identical to that observed for these groups in the trypsin-APPI complex, where Arg 15(I) is an optimal side chain for tryptic specificity. To further evaluate the diversity of sequences that can be accommodated by one of these inhibitors, APPI, we used phage display to randomly mutate residues 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19, which are major binding determinants. Inhibitors variants were selected that bound to either trypsin or chymotrypsin. As expected, trypsin specificity was principally directed by having a basic side chain at P1 (position 15); however, the P1 residues that were selected for chymotrypsin binding were His and Asn, rather than the expected large hydrophobic types. This can be rationalized by modeling these hydrophilic side chains to have similar H-bonding interactions to those observed in the structures of the described complexes. The specificity, or lack thereof, for the other individual subsites is discussed in the context of the "allowed" residues determined from a phage display mutagenesis selection experiment.
9692985	Structural role of the 30's loop in determining the ligand specificity of the human immunodeficiency virus protease.	The structural basis of ligand specificity in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease has been investigated by determining the crystal structures of three chimeric HIV proteases complexed with SB203386, a tripeptide analogue inhibitor. The chimeras are constructed by substituting amino acid residues in the HIV type 1 (HIV-1) protease sequence with the corresponding residues from HIV type 2 (HIV-2) in the region spanning residues 31-37 and in the active site cavity. SB203386 is a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 protease (Ki = 18 nM) but has a decreased affinity for HIV-2 protease (Ki = 1280 nM). Crystallographic analysis reveals that substitution of residues 31-37 (30's loop) with those of HIV-2 protease renders the chimera similar to HIV-2 protease in both the inhibitor binding affinity and mode of binding (two inhibitor molecules per protease dimer). However, further substitution of active site residues 47 and 82 has a compensatory effect which restores the HIV-1-like inhibitor binding mode (one inhibitor molecule in the center of the protease active site) and partially restores the affinity. Comparison of the three chimeric protease structures with those of HIV-1 and SIV proteases complexed with the same inhibitor reveals structural changes in the flap regions and the 80's loops, as well as changes in the dimensions of the active site cavity. The study provides structural evidence of the role of the 30's loop in conferring inhibitor specificity in HIV proteases.
9697776	Structure of the metal-ion-activated diphtheria toxin repressor/tox operator complex.	The virulent phenotype of the pathogenic bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae is conferred by diphtheria toxin, whose expression is an adaptive response to low concentrations of iron. The expression of the toxin gene (tox) is regulated by the repressor DtxR, which is activated by transition metal ions. X-ray crystal structures of DtxR with and without (apo-form) its coordinated transition metal ion have established the general architecture of the repressor, identified the location of the metal-binding sites, and revealed a metal-ion-triggered subunit-subunit 'caliper-like' conformational change. Here we report the three-dimensional crystal structure of the complex between a biologically active Ni(II)-bound DtxR(C102D) mutant, in which a cysteine is replaced by an aspartate at residue 102, and a 33-base-pair DNA segment containing the toxin operator toxO. This structure shows that DNA interacts with two dimeric repressor proteins bound to opposite sides of the tox operator. We propose that a metal-ion-induced helix-to-coil structural transition in the amino-terminal region of the protein is partly responsible for the unique mode of repressor activation by transition metal ions.
7540935	Mechanism of inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase by non-nucleoside inhibitors.	The structure of unliganded HIV-1 reverse transcriptase has been determined at 2.35 A resolution and refined to an R-factor of 0.219 (for all data) with good stereochemistry. The unliganded structure was produced by soaking out a weak binding non-nucleoside inhibitor, HEPT, from pregrown crystals. Comparison with the structures of four different RT and non-nucleoside inhibitor complexes reveals that only minor domain rearrangements occur, but there is a significant repositioning of a three-stranded beta-sheet in the p66 subunit (containing the catalytic aspartic acid residues 110, 185 and 186) with respect to the rest of the polymerase site. This suggests that NNIs inhibit RT by locking the polymerase active site in an inactive conformation, reminiscent of the conformation observed in the inactive p51 subunit.
2269354	Engineering of microheterogeneity-resistant p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase from Pseudomonas fluorescens.	By site-directed mutagenesis, Cys-116 was converted to Ser-116 in p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.2) from Pseudomonas fluorescens. In contrast to wild-type enzyme, the C116S mutant is no longer susceptible to oxidation by hydrogen peroxide and shows no reactivity towards 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate). Crystals of the C116S mutant are isomorphous with the crystal form of wild-type enzyme. A difference electron density confirms the mutation made.
10346917	Mechanistic implications from crystalline complexes of wild-type and mutant adenylosuccinate synthetases from Escherichia coli.	Asp13 and His41 are essential residues of adenylosuccinate synthetase, putatively catalyzing the formation of adenylosuccinate from an intermediate of 6-phosphoryl-IMP. Wild-type adenylosuccinate synthetase and three mutant synthetases (Arg143 --> Leu, Lys16 --> Gln, and Arg303 --> Leu) from Eschericha coli have been crystallized in the presence of IMP, hadacidin (an analogue of L-aspartate), Mg2+, and GTP. The active site of each complex contains 6-phosphoryl-IMP, Mg2+, GDP, and hadacidin, except for the Arg303 --> Leu mutant, which does not bind hadacidin. In response to the formation of 6-phosphoryl-IMP, Asp13 enters the inner coordination sphere of the active site Mg2+. His41 hydrogen bonds with 6-phosphoryl-IMP, except in the Arg303 --> Leu complex, where it remains bound to the guanine nucleotide. Hence, recognition of the active site Mg2+ by Asp13 evidently occurs after the formation of 6-phosphoryl-IMP, but recognition of the intermediate by His41 may require the association of L-aspartate with the active site. Structures reported here support a mechanism in which Asp13 and His41 act as the catalytic base and acid, respectively, in the formation of 6-phosphoryl-IMP, and then act together as catalytic acids in the subsequent formation of adenylosuccinate.
1552945	A human recombinant haemoglobin designed for use as a blood substitute.	The need to develop a blood substitute is now urgent because of the increasing concern over blood-transmitted viral and bacterial pathogens. Cell-free haemoglobin solutions and human haemoglobin synthesized in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been investigated as potential oxygen-carrying substitutes for red blood cells. But these haemoglobins cannot be used as a blood substitute because (1) the oxygen affinity in the absence of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate is too high to allow unloading of enough oxygen in the tissues, and (2) they dissociate into alpha beta dimers that are cleared rapidly by renal filtration, which can result in long-term kidney damage. We have produced a human haemoglobin using an expression vector containing one gene encoding a mutant beta-globin with decreased oxygen affinity and one duplicated, tandemly fused alpha-globin gene. Fusion of the two alpha-globin subunits increases the half-life of this haemoglobin molecule in vivo by preventing its dissociation into alpha beta dimers and therefore also eliminates renal toxicity.
16366586	Structure and function of GDP-mannose-3',5'-epimerase: an enzyme which performs three chemical reactions at the same active site.	GDP-mannose-3',5'-epimerase (GME) from Arabidopsis thaliana catalyzes the epimerization of both the 3' and 5' positions of GDP-alpha-D-mannose to yield GDP-beta-L-galactose. Production of the C5' epimer of GDP-alpha-D-mannose, GDP-beta-L-gulose, has also been reported. The reaction occurs as part of vitamin C biosynthesis in plants. We have determined structures of complexes of GME with GDP-alpha-D-mannose, GDP-beta-L-galactose, and a mixture of GDP-beta-L-gulose with GDP-beta-L-4-keto-gulose to resolutions varying from 2.0 to 1.4 A. The enzyme has the classical extended short-chain dehydratase/reductase (SDR) fold. We have confirmed that GME establishes an equilibrium between two products, GDP-beta-L-galactose and GDP-beta-L-gulose. The reaction proceeds by C4' oxidation of GDP-alpha-D-mannose followed by epimerization of the C5' position to give GDP-beta-L-4-keto-gulose. This intermediate is either reduced to give GDP-beta-L-gulose or the C3' position is epimerized to give GDP-beta-L-4-keto-galactose, then C4' is reduced to GDP-beta-L-galactose. The combination of oxidation, epimerization, and reduction in a single active site is unusual. Structural analysis coupled to site-directed mutagenesis suggests C145 and K217 as the acid/base pair responsible for both epimerizations. On the basis of the structure of the GDP-beta-L-gulose/GDP-beta-L-4-keto-gulose co-complex, we predict that a ring flip occurs during the first epimerization and that a boat intermediate is likely for the second epimerization. Comparison of GME with other SDR enzymes known to abstract a protein alpha to the keto function of a carbohydrate identifies key common features.
9628477	Structural basis for the interaction of Ras with RalGDS.	The Ras protein signals to a number of distinct pathways by interacting with diverse downstream effectors. Among the effectors of Ras are the Raf kinase and RalGDS, a guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator specific for Ral. Despite the absence of significant sequence similarities, both effectors bind directly to Ras, but with different specificities. We report here the 2.1 A crystal structure of the complex between Ras and the Ras-interacting domain (RID) of RalGDS. This structure reveals that the beta-sheet of the RID joins the switch I region of Ras to form an extended beta-sheet with a topology similar to that found in the Rap-Raf complex. However, the side chain interactions at the joining junctions of the two interacting systems and the relative orientation of the two binding domains are distinctly different. Furthermore, in the case of the Ras-RID complex a second RID molecule also interacts with a different part of the Ras molecule, the switch II region. These findings account for the cross-talk between the Ras and Ral pathways and the specificity with which Ras distinguishes the two effectors.
11513589	Structural characterization of the enzyme-substrate, enzyme-intermediate, and enzyme-product complexes of thiamin phosphate synthase.	Thiamin phosphate synthase catalyzes the formation of thiamin phosphate from 4-amino-5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methylpyrimidine pyrophosphate and 5-(hydroxyethyl)-4-methylthiazole phosphate. Several lines of evidence suggest that the reaction proceeds via a dissociative mechanism. The previously determined crystal structure of thiamin phosphate synthase in complex with the reaction products, thiamin phosphate and magnesium pyrophosphate, provided a view of the active site and suggested a number of additional experiments. We report here seven new crystal structures primarily involving crystals of S130A thiamin phosphate synthase soaked in solutions containing substrates or products. We prepared S130A thiamin phosphate synthase with the intent of characterizing the enzyme-substrate complex. Surprisingly, in three thiamin phosphate synthase structures, the active site density cannot be modeled as either substrates or products. For these structures, the best fit to the electron density is provided by a model that consists of independent pyrimidine, pyrophosphate, and thiazole phosphate fragments, consistent with a carbenium ion intermediate. The resulting carbenium ion is likely to be further stabilized by proton transfer from the pyrimidine amino group to the pyrophosphate to give the pyrimidine iminemethide, which we believe is the species that is observed in the crystal structures.
15691839	The crystal structures of EAP domains from Staphylococcus aureus reveal an unexpected homology to bacterial superantigens.	The Eap (extracellular adherence protein) of Staphylococcus aureus functions as a secreted virulence factor by mediating interactions between the bacterial cell surface and several extracellular host proteins. Eap proteins from different Staphylococcal strains consist of four to six tandem repeats of a structurally uncharacterized domain (EAP domain). We have determined the three-dimensional structures of three different EAP domains to 1.8, 2.2, and 1.35 A resolution, respectively. These structures reveal a core fold that is comprised of an alpha-helix lying diagonally across a five-stranded, mixed beta-sheet. Comparison of EAP domains with known structures reveals an unexpected homology with the C-terminal domain of bacterial superantigens. Examination of the structure of the superantigen SEC2 bound to the beta-chain of a T-cell receptor suggests a possible ligand-binding site within the EAP domain (Fields, B. A., Malchiodi, E. L., Li, H., Ysern, X., Stauffacher, C. V., Schlievert, P. M., Karjalainen, K., and Mariuzza, R. (1996) Nature 384, 188-192). These results provide the first structural characterization of EAP domains, relate EAP domains to a large class of bacterial toxins, and will guide the design of future experiments to analyze EAP domain structure/function relationships.
10557269	Structure of the HIV-1 integrase catalytic domain complexed with an inhibitor: a platform for antiviral drug design.	HIV integrase, the enzyme that inserts the viral DNA into the host chromosome, has no mammalian counterpart, making it an attractive target for antiviral drug design. As one of the three enzymes produced by HIV, it can be expected that inhibitors of this enzyme will complement the therapeutic use of HIV protease and reverse transcriptase inhibitors. We have determined the structure of a complex of the HIV-1 integrase core domain with a novel inhibitor, 5ClTEP, 1-(5-chloroindol-3-yl)-3-hydroxy-3-(2H-tetrazol-5-yl)-pro penone, to 2.1-A resolution. The inhibitor binds centrally in the active site of the integrase and makes a number of close contacts with the protein. Only minor changes in the protein accompany inhibitor binding. This inhibitor complex will provide a platform for structure-based design of an additional class of inhibitors for antiviral therapy.
8805591	Crystal structure of reduced protein R2 of ribonucleotide reductase: the structural basis for oxygen activation at a dinuclear iron site.	BACKGROUND. Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) catalyze the formation of the deoxyribonucleotides that are essential for DNA synthesis. The R2 subunit of Escherichia coli RNR is a homodimer containing one dinuclear iron centre per monomer. A tyrosyl radical is essential for catalysis, and is formed via a reaction in which the reduced, diferrous form of the iron centre activates dioxygen. To help understand the mechanism of oxygen activation, we examined the structure of the diferrous form of R2. RESULTS. The crystal structures of reduced forms of both wild type R2 and a mutant of R2 (Ser211--> Ala) have been determined at 1.7 A and 2.2 A resolution, respectively. The diferrous iron centre was compared to the previously determined structure of the oxidized, diferric form of R2. In both forms of R2 the iron centre is coordinated by the same carboxylate dominated ligand sphere, but in the reduced form there are clear conformational changes in three of the carboxylate ligands and the bridging mu-oxo group and two water molecules are lost. In the reduced form of R2 the coordination number decreases from six to four for both ferrous ions, explaining their high reactivity towards dioxygen. The structure of the mutant Ser211--> Ala, known to have impaired reduction kinetics, shows a large conformational change in one of the neighbouring helices although the iron coordination is very similar to the wild type protein. CONCLUSIONS. Carboxylate shifts are often important for carboxylate coordinated metal clusters; they allow the metals to achieve different coordination modes in redox reactions. In the case of reduced R2 these carboxylate shifts allow the formation of accessible reaction sites for dioxygen. The Ser211--> Ala mutant displays a conformational change in the helix containing the mutation, explaining its altered reduction kinetics.
1613787	Purification and crystallization of glycogen phosphorylase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	Glycogen phosphorylase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is activated by the covalent phosphorylation of a single threonine residue in the N terminus of the protein. We have hypothesized that the structural features that effect activation must be distinct from those characterized in rabbit muscle phosphorylase because the two enzymes have unrelated phosphorylation sites located in dissimilar protein contexts. To understand this potentially novel mechanism of activation by phosphorylation, we require information at atomic resolution of the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of the enzyme. To this end, we have purified, characterized and crystallized glycogen phosphorylase from S. cerevisiae. The enzyme was isolated from a phosphorylase-deficient strain harboring a multicopy plasmid containing the phosphorylase gene under the control of its own promoter. One liter of cultured cells yields 12 mg of crystallizable material. The purified protein was not phosphorylated and had an activity of 4.7 units/mg in the presence of saturating amounts of substrate. Yeast phosphorylase was crystallized in four different crystal forms, only one of which is suitable for diffraction studies at high resolution. The latter belongs to space group P4(1)2(1)2 with unit cell constants of a = 161.1 A and c = 175.5 A Based on the density of the crystals, the solvent content is 49.7%, indicating that the asymmetric unit contains the functional dimer of yeast phosphorylase.
11084036	Waterproofing the heme pocket. Role of proximal amino acid side chains in preventing hemin loss from myoglobin.	The ability of myoglobin to bind oxygen reversibly depends critically on retention of the heme prosthetic group. Globin side chains at the Leu(89)(F4), His(97)(FG3), Ile(99)(FG5), and Leu(104)(G5) positions on the proximal side of the heme pocket strongly influence heme affinity. The roles of these amino acids in preventing heme loss have been examined by determining high resolution structures of 14 different mutants at these positions using x-ray crystallography. Leu(89) and His(97) are important surface amino acids that interact either sterically or electrostatically with the edges of the porphyrin ring. Ile(99) and Leu(104) are located in the interior region of the proximal pocket beneath ring C of the heme prosthetic group. The apolar amino acids Leu(89), Ile(99), and Leu(104) "waterproof" the heme pocket by forming a barrier to solvent penetration, minimizing the size of the proximal cavity, and maintaining a hydrophobic environment. Substitutions with smaller or polar side chains at these positions result in exposure of the heme to solvent, the appearance of crystallographically defined water molecules in or near the proximal pocket, and large increases in the rate of hemin loss. Thus, the naturally occurring amino acid side chains at these positions serve to prevent hydration of the His(93)-Fe(III) bond and are highly conserved in all known myoglobins and hemoglobins.
6822532	The catalytic mechanism of glutathione reductase as derived from x-ray diffraction analyses of reaction intermediates.	The mode of binding of NADPH and oxidized glutathione to the flavoenzyme glutathione reductase has been determined by x-ray crystallography. Furthermore, two intermediates of the reaction have been produced in the crystal and have been structurally elucidated. All these analyses were done at 0.3 nm resolution. The results allow the stereochemical description of the mechanism of the enzyme. The dinucleotide NADPH is bound in an extended conformation with the nicotinamide ring stacking onto the re-face of the flavin part of FAD, and adenine located at the protein surface. The binding of NADPH results in the 2-electron reduced form of the enzyme, EH2. This form has also been analyzed without any ligand bound. In EH2 the redoxactive disulfide bridge of the protein, which lies at the si-face of the flavin ring, is opened and the sulfur of Cys-58 moves by about 0.1 nm into a position where it can attack one of the sulfurs of the substrate oxidized glutathione. This interchange leads to a mixed glutathione-protein disulfide, which can be stabilized in crystals and has been analyzed. By selectively reacting Cys-58 with iodoacetamide the crystalline enzyme can be blocked in its EH2 state. The imidazole of His-467' is near to all sulfurs taking part in the disulfide bridge exchange and is therefore certainly crucial for catalysis. The crystallographic results establish that electrons flow from NADPH to the substrate GSSG via flavin and the redoxactive protein disulfide bridge. This is consistent with the scheme that has been postulated from biochemical, spectroscopic, and model studies.
7836458	How potassium affects the activity of the molecular chaperone Hsc70. II. Potassium binds specifically in the ATPase active site.	Crystallographic anomalous scattering from potassium at 1.7 A resolution reveals two monovalent ions that interact with MgADP and P(i) in the nucleotide binding cleft of wild-type recombinant bovine Hsc70 ATPase fragment. K+ at site 1 interacts with oxygens of the beta-phosphate of ADP, whereas K+ at site 2 interacts with an oxygen of P(i). Both K+ ions also interact with specific H2O molecules in the first hydration shell of the octahedrally coordinated Mg2+ ion and with specific protein ligands. In crystals that have Na+ present, K+ is replaced by a Na+ ion at site 1 and by a Na(+)-H2O pair at site 2. The K+ ions are positioned where they could stabilize binding of a beta,gamma-bidentate MgATP complex with Hsc70, as well as a transition state during ATP hydrolysis, suggesting that monovalent ions act as specific metal cofactors in the ATPase reaction of Hsc70.
9087403	Structure of 20S proteasome from yeast at 2.4 A resolution.	The crystal structure of the 20S proteasome from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae shows that its 28 protein subunits are arranged as an (alpha1...alpha7, beta1...beta7)2 complex in four stacked rings and occupy unique locations. The interior of the particle, which harbours the active sites, is only accessible by some very narrow side entrances. The beta-type subunits are synthesized as proproteins before being proteolytically processed for assembly into the particle. The proforms of three of the seven different beta-type subunits, beta1/PRE3, beta2/PUP1 and beta5/PRE2, are cleaved between the threonine at position 1 and the last glycine of the pro-sequence, with release of the active-site residue Thr 1. These three beta-type subunits have inhibitor-binding sites, indicating that PRE2 has a chymotrypsin-like and a trypsin-like activity and that PRE3 has peptidylglutamyl peptide hydrolytic specificity. Other beta-type subunits are processed to an intermediate form, indicating that an additional nonspecific endopeptidase activity may exist which is important for peptide hydrolysis and for the generation of ligands for class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex.
10220341	The effects of an engineered cation site on the structure, activity, and EPR properties of cytochrome c peroxidase.	Earlier work [Bonagura et al. (1996) Biochemistry 35, 6107] showed that the K+ site found in the proximal pocket of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) could be engineered into cytochrome c peroxidase (CCP). Binding of K+ at the engineered site results in a loss in activity and destabilization of the CCP compound I Trp191 cationic radical owing to long-range electrostatic effects. The engineered CCP mutant crystal structure has been refined to 1.5 A using data obtained at cryogenic temperatures which provides a more detailed basis for comparison with the naturally occurring K+ site in APX. The characteristic EPR signal associated with the Trp191 radical becomes progressively weaker as K+ is added, which correlates well with the loss in enzyme activity as [K+] is increased. These results coupled with stopped-flow studies support our earlier conclusions that the loss in activity and EPR signal is due to destabilization of the Trp191 cationic radical.
10504240	Contribution of intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds to the conformational stability of human lysozyme(,).	In globular proteins, there are intermolecular hydrogen bonds between protein and water molecules, and between water molecules, which are bound with the proteins, in addition to intramolecular hydrogen bonds. To estimate the contribution of these hydrogen bonds to the conformational stability of a protein, the thermodynamic parameters for denaturation and the crystal structures of five Thr to Val and five Thr to Ala mutant human lysozymes were determined. The denaturation Gibbs energy (DeltaG) of Thr to Val and Thr to Ala mutant proteins was changed from 4.0 to -5.6 kJ/mol and from 1.6 to -6.3 kJ/mol, respectively, compared with that of the wild-type protein. The contribution of hydrogen bonds to the stability (DeltaDeltaG(HB)) of the Thr and other mutant human lysozymes previously reported was extracted from the observed stability changes (DeltaDeltaG) with correction for changes in hydrophobicity and side chain conformational entropy between the wild-type and mutant structures. The estimation of the DeltaDeltaG(HB) values of all mutant proteins after removal of hydrogen bonds, including protein-water hydrogen bonds, indicates a favorable contribution of the intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds to the protein stability. The net contribution of an intramolecular hydrogen bond (DeltaG(HB[pp])), an intermolecular one between protein and ordered water molecules (DeltaG(HB[pw])), and an intermolecular one between ordered water molecules (DeltaG(HB[ww])) could be estimated to be 8. 5, 5.2, and 5.0 kJ/mol, respectively, for a 3 A long hydrogen bond. This result shows the different contributions to protein stability of intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The entropic cost due to the introduction of a water molecule (DeltaG(H)()2(O)) could be also estimated to be about 8 kJ/mol.
9568905	Solution structure and dynamics of a designed monomeric variant of the lambda Cro repressor.	The solution structure of a monomeric variant of the lambda Cro repressor has been determined by multidimensional NMR. Cro K56[DGEVK] differs from wild-type Cro by the insertion of five amino acids at the center of the dimer interface. 1H and 15N resonances for 70 of the 71 residues have been assigned. Thirty-two structures were calculated by hybrid distance geometry/simulated annealing methods using 463 NOE-distance restraints, 26 hydrogen-bond, and 39 dihedral-angle restraints. The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) from the average structure for atoms in residues 3-60 is 1.03 +/- 0.44 A for the peptide backbone and 1.6 +/- 0.73 A for all nonhydrogen atoms. The overall structure conforms very well to the original design. Although the five inserted residues form a beta hairpin as expected, this engineered turn as well as other turns in the structure are not well defined by the NMR data. Dynamics studies of backbone amides reveal T1/T2 ratios of residues in the alpha2-alpha3, beta2-beta3, and engineered turn that are reflective of chemical exchange or internal motion. The solution structure and dynamics are discussed in light of the conformational variation that has been observed in other Cro structures, and the importance of flexibility in DNA recognition.
9335537	Probing the roles of active site residues in phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus by site-directed mutagenesis.	The role of amino acid residues located in the active site pocket of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) from Bacillus cereus[Heinz, D. W., Ryan, M., Bullock, T., & Griffith, O. H. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 3855-3863] was investigated by site-directed mutagenesis, kinetics, and crystal structure analysis. Twelve residues involved in catalysis and substrate binding (His32, Arg69, His82, Gly83, Lys115, Glu117, Arg163, Trp178, Asp180, Asp198, Tyr200, and Asp274) were individually replaced by 1-3 other amino acids, resulting in a total number of 21 mutants. Replacements in the mutants H32A, H32L, R69A, R69E, R69K, H82A, H82L, E117K, R163I, D198A, D198E, D198S, Y200S, and D274S caused essentially complete inactivation of the enzyme. The remaining mutants (G83S, K115E, R163K, W178Y, D180S, Y200F, and D274N) exhibited reduced activities up to 57% when compared with wild-type PI-PLC. Crystal structures determined at a resolution ranging from 2.0 to 2.7 A for six mutants (H32A, H32L, R163K, D198E, D274N, and D274S) showed that significant changes were confined to the site of the respective mutation without perturbation of the rest of the structure. Only in mutant D198E do the side chains of two neighboring arginine residues move across the inositol binding pocket toward the newly introduced glutamic acid. An analysis of these structure-function relationships provides new insight into the catalytic mechanism, and suggests a molecular explanation of some of the substrate stereospecificity and inhibitor binding data available for this enzyme.
16218957	Molecular basis for substrate recognition and drug resistance from 1.1 to 1.6 angstroms resolution crystal structures of HIV-1 protease mutants with substrate analogs.	HIV-1 protease (PR) and two drug-resistant variants--PR with the V82A mutation (PR(V82A)) and PR with the I84V mutation (PR(I84V))--were studied using reduced peptide analogs of five natural cleavage sites (CA-p2, p2-NC, p6pol-PR, p1-p6 and NC-p1) to understand the structural and kinetic changes. The common drug-resistant mutations V82A and I84V alter residues forming the substrate-binding site. Eight crystal structures were refined at resolutions of 1.10-1.60 A. Differences in the PR-analog interactions depended on the peptide sequence and were consistent with the relative inhibition. Analog p6(pol)-PR formed more hydrogen bonds of P2 Asn with PR and fewer van der Waals contacts at P1' Pro compared with those formed by CA-p2 or p2-NC in PR complexes. The P3 Gly in p1-p6 provided fewer van der Waals contacts and hydrogen bonds at P2-P3 and more water-mediated interactions. PR(I84V) showed reduced van der Waals interactions with inhibitor compared with PR, which was consistent with kinetic data. The structures suggest that the binding affinity for mutants is modulated by the conformational flexibility of the substrate analogs. The complexes of PR(V82A) showed smaller shifts of the main chain atoms of Ala82 relative to PR, but more movement of the peptide analog, compared to complexes with clinical inhibitors. PR(V82A) was able to compensate for the loss of interaction with inhibitor caused by mutation, in agreement with kinetic data, but substrate analogs have more flexibility than the drugs to accommodate the structural changes caused by mutation. Hence, these structures help to explain how HIV can develop drug resistance while retaining the ability of PR to hydrolyze natural substrates.
9837729	Structure and functional implications of the polymerase active site region in a complex of HIV-1 RT with a double-stranded DNA template-primer and an antibody Fab fragment at 2.8 A resolution.	The structure of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) complexed with a 19-mer/18-mer double-stranded DNA template-primer (dsDNA) and the Fab fragment of monoclonal antibody 28 (Fab28) has been refined at 2.8 A resolution. The structures of the polymerase active site and neighboring regions are described in detail and a number of novel insights into mechanisms of polymerase catalysis and drug inhibition are presented. The three catalytically essential amino acid residues (Asp110, Asp185, and Asp186) are located close to the 3' terminus of the primer strand. Observation of a hydrogen bond between the 3'-OH of the primer terminus and the side-chain of Asp185 suggests that the carboxylate of Asp185 could act as a general base in initiating the nucleophilic attack during polymerization. Nearly all of the close protein-DNA interactions involve atoms of the sugar-phosphate backbone of the nucleic acid. However, the phenoxyl side-chain of Tyr183, which is part of the conserved YMDD motif, has hydrogen-bonding interactions with nucleotide bases of the second duplex base-pair and is predicted to have at least one hydrogen bond with all Watson-Crick base-pairs at this position. Comparison of the structure of the active site region in the HIV-1 RT/dsDNA complex with all other HIV-1 RT structures suggests that template-primer binding is accompanied by significant conformational changes of the YMDD motif that may be relevant for mechanisms of both polymerization and inhibition by non-nucleoside inhibitors. Interactions of the "primer grip" (the beta12-beta13 hairpin) with the 3' terminus of the primer strand primarily involve the main-chain atoms of Met230 and Gly231 and the primer terminal phosphate. Alternative positions of the primer grip observed in different HIV-1 RT structures may be related to conformational changes that normally occur during DNA polymerization and translocation. In the vicinity of the polymerase active site, there are a number of aromatic residues that are involved in energetically favorable pi-pi interactions and may be involved in the transitions between different stages of the catalytic process. The protein structural elements primarily responsible for precise positioning of the template-primer (including the primer grip, template grip, and helices alphaH and alphaI of the p66 thumb) can be thought of functioning as a "translocation track" that guides the relative movement of nucleic acid and protein during polymerization.
11914073	Crystallographic evidence of a transglycosylation reaction: ternary complexes of a psychrophilic alpha-amylase.	The psychrophilic Pseudoalteromonas haloplanctis alpha-amylase is shown to form ternary complexes with two alpha-amylase inhibitors present in the active site region, namely, a molecule of Tris and a trisaccharide inhibitor or heptasaccharide inhibitor, respectively. The crystal structures of these complexes have been determined by X-ray crystallography to 1.80 and 1.74 A resolution, respectively. In both cases, the prebound inhibitor Tris is expelled from the active site by the incoming oligosaccharide inhibitor substrate analogue, but stays linked to it, forming well-defined ternary complexes with the enzyme. These results illustrate competition in the crystalline state between two inhibitors, an oligosaccharide substrate analogue and a Tris molecule, bound at the same time in the active site region. Taken together, these structures show that the enzyme performs transglycosylation in the complex with the pseudotetrasaccharide acarbose (confirmed by a mutant structure), leading to a well-defined heptasaccharide, considered as a more potent inhibitor. Furthermore, the substrate-induced ordering of water molecules within a channel highlights a possible pathway used for hydrolysis of starch and related poly- and oligosaccharides.
7929197	Fine tuning the specificity of the periplasmic phosphate transport receptor. Site-directed mutagenesis, ligand binding, and crystallographic studies.	Phosphorous, primarily in the form of phosphate, is a critical nutrient for the life of a cell. We have previously determined the 1.7-A resolution structure of the phosphate-binding protein, an initial receptor for the high-affinity phosphate active transport system or permease in Escherichia coli (Luecke, H., and Quiocho, F.A. (1990) Nature 347, 402-406). This structure is the first to reveal the key role of hydrogen bonding interactions in conferring the high specificity of the permease, a specificity also shared by other phosphate transport systems. Both monobasic and dibasic phosphates are recognized by the phosphate-binding protein with Asp56 playing a key role. Here we report site-directed mutagenesis, ligand binding, and crystallographic studies of the binding protein which show that introduction of one additional Asp by mutagenesis of the Thr141 in the ligand-binding site restricts binding to only the monobasic phosphate.
1522592	Crystal structure of glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase from Escherichia coli at 3.0 A resolution. A target enzyme for chemotherapy.	The atomic structure of glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase, an essential enzyme in purine biosynthesis, has been determined at 3.0 A resolution. The last three C-terminal residues and a sequence stretch of 18 residues (residues 113 to 130) are not visible in the electron density map. The enzyme forms a dimer in the crystal structure. Each monomer is divided into two domains, which are connected by a central mainly parallel seven-stranded beta-sheet. The N-terminal domain contains a Rossmann type mononucleotide fold with a phosphate ion bound to the C-terminal end of the first beta-strand. A long narrow cleft stretches from the phosphate to a conserved aspartic acid, Asp144, which has been suggested as an active-site residue. The cleft is lined by a cluster of residues, which are conserved between bacterial, yeast, avian and human enzymes, and likely represents the binding pocket and active site of the enzyme. GAR Tfase binds a reduced folate cofactor and glycinamide ribonucleotide for the catalysis of one of the initial steps in purine biosynthesis. Folate analogs and multi-substrate inhibitors of the enzyme have antineoplastic effects and the structure determination of the unliganded enzyme and enzyme-inhibitor complexes will aid the development of anti-cancer drugs.
1324167	X-ray structure of nucleoside diphosphate kinase.	The X-ray structure of a point mutant of nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDP kinase) from Dictyostelium discoideum has been determined to 2.2 A resolution. The enzyme is a hexamer made of identical subunits with a novel mononucleotide binding fold. Each subunit contains an alpha/beta domain with a four stranded, antiparallel beta-sheet. The topology is different from adenylate kinase, but identical to the allosteric domain of Escherichia coli ATCase regulatory subunits, which bind mononucleotides at an equivalent position. Dimer contacts between NDP kinase subunits within the hexamer are similar to those in ATCase. Trimer contacts involve a large loop of polypeptide chain that bears the site of the Pro----Ser substitution in Killer of prune (K-pn) mutants of the highly homologous Drosophila enzyme. Properties of Drosophila NDP kinase, the product of the awd developmental gene, and of the human enzyme, the product of the nm23 genes in tumorigenesis, are discussed in view of the three-dimensional structure and of possible interactions of NDP kinase with other nucleotide binding proteins.
12575936	A novel protein fold and extreme domain swapping in the dimeric TorD chaperone from Shewanella massilia.	TorD is the cytoplasmic chaperone involved in the maturation of the molybdoenzyme TorA prior to the translocation of the folded protein into the periplasm. The X-ray structure at 2.4 A resolution of the TorD dimer reveals extreme domain swapping between the two subunits. The all-helical architecture of the globular domains within the intertwined molecular dimer shows no similarity with known protein structures. According to sequence similarities, this new fold probably represents the architecture of the chaperones associated with the bacterial DMSO/TMAO reductases and also that of proteins of yet unknown functions. The occurrence of multiple oligomeric forms and the chaperone activity of both monomeric and dimeric TorD raise questions about the possible biological role of domain swapping in this protein.
8906788	Structure of the complex between human T-cell receptor, viral peptide and HLA-A2.	Recognition by a T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) of peptide complexed with a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule occurs through variable loops in the TCR structure which bury almost all the available peptide and a much larger area of the MHC molecule. The TCR fits diagonally across the MHC peptide-binding site in a surface feature common to all class I and class II MHC molecules, providing evidence that the nature of binding is general. A broadly applicable binding mode has implications for the mechanism of repertoire selection and the magnitude of alloreactions.
10091652	The solution structure of a superpotent B-chain-shortened single-replacement insulin analogue.	This paper reports on an insulin analogue with 12.5-fold receptor affinity, the highest increase observed for a single replacement, and on its solution structure, determined by NMR spectroscopy. The analogue is [D-AlaB26]des-(B27-B30)-tetrapeptide-insulin-B26-amide. C-terminal truncation of the B-chain by four (or five) residues is known not to affect the functional properties of insulin, provided the new carboxylate charge is neutralized. As opposed to the dramatic increase in receptor affinity caused by the substitution of D-Ala for the wild-type residue TyrB26 in the truncated molecule, this very substitution reduces it to only 18% of that of the wild-type hormone when the B-chain is present in full length. The insulin molecule in solution is visualized as an ensemble of conformers interrelated by a dynamic equilibrium. The question is whether the "active" conformation of the hormone, sought after in innumerable structure/function studies, is or is not included in the accessible conformational space, so that it could be adopted also in the absence of the receptor. If there were any chance for the active conformation, or at least a predisposed state to be populated to a detectable extent, this chance should be best in the case of a superpotent analogue. This was the motivation for the determination of the three-dimensional structure of [D-AlaB26]des-(B27-B30)-tetrapeptide-insulin-B26-amide. However, neither the NMR data nor CD spectroscopic comparison of a number of related analogues provided a clue concerning structural features predisposing insulin to high receptor affinity. After the present study it seems more likely than before that insulin will adopt its active conformation only when exposed to the force field of the receptor surface.
8706862	A covalently bound catalytic intermediate in Escherichia coli asparaginase: crystal structure of a Thr-89-Val mutant.	Escherichia coli asparaginase II catalyzes the hydrolysis of L-asparagine to L-aspartate via a threonine-bound acyl-enzyme intermediate. A nearly inactive mutant in which one of the active site threonines, Thr-89, was replaced by valine was constructed, expressed, and crystallized. Its structure, solved at 2.2 A resolution, shows high overall similarity to the wild-type enzyme, but an aspartyl moiety is covalently bound to Thr-12, resembling a reaction intermediate. Kinetic analysis confirms the deacylation deficiency, which is also explained on a structural basis. The previously identified oxyanion hole is described in more detail.
15805589	Structure of pyrR (Rv1379) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis: a persistence gene and protein drug target.	The Mycobacterium tuberculosis pyrR gene (Rv1379) encodes a protein that regulates the expression of pyrimidine-nucleotide biosynthesis (pyr) genes in a UMP-dependent manner. Because pyrimidine biosynthesis is an essential step in the progression of TB, the gene product pyrR is an attractive antitubercular drug target. The 1.9 A native structure of Mtb pyrR determined by the TB Structural Genomics Consortium facilities in trigonal space group P3(1)21 is reported, with unit-cell parameters a = 66.64, c = 154.72 A at 120 K and two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The three-dimensional structure and residual uracil phosphoribosyltransferase activity point to a common PRTase ancestor for pyrR. However, while PRPP- and UMP-binding sites have been retained in Mtb pyrR, a distinct dimer interaction among subunits creates a deep positively charged cleft capable of binding pyr mRNA. In silico screening of pyrimidine-nucleoside analogs has revealed a number of potential lead compounds that, if bound to Mtb pyrR, could facilitate transcriptional attenuation, particularly cyclopentenyl nucleosides.
9918723	The crystal structure of the sevenfold mutant of barley beta-amylase with increased thermostability at 2.5 A resolution.	The three-dimensional structure of the sevenfold mutant of barley beta-amylase (BBA-7s) with increased thermostability was determined by X-ray crystallography. The enzyme was purified as a single component and crystallized by a hanging drop method in the presence of 14 % PEG 6000. The crystals belong to space group P43212 with cell dimensions a=b=72.11 A, c=250.51 A. The diffraction data up to 2.5 A were collected after soaking the crystal in 100 mM maltose with Rsym of 8.6 %. The structure was determined by a molecular replacement method using soybean beta-amylase (SBA) as a search model and refined to an R-factor of 18.7 %. The final model included 500 amino acid residues, 141 water molecules and three glucose residues, which were located at subsites 1-2 and 4 in the active site. The r.m.s. distance of 485 Calpha atoms between BBA-7s and SBA was 0.62 A. Out of the seven mutated amino acids, four (Ser295Ala, Ile297Val, Ser351Pro and Ala376Ser) were substitutions from the common residues with SBA to the thermostable forms. A comparison of the structures of BBA-7s and SBA indicated that the side-chain of Ser376 makes new hydrogen bonds to the main-chain of an adjacent beta-strand, and that the side-chains of Val297 reduce an unfavorable interaction between the side-chains of Ala314. The mutation of Ser295Ala breaks the hydrogen bond between Ser295 OG and Tyr195 OH, which seems to be the reason for the unoccupied glucose residue at subsite 3. The tandem mutations at 350-352 including substitutions to two Pro residues suggested the reduction of main-chain entropy in the unfolded structure of this solvent-exposed protruded loop.
9174360	Glutathione reductase turned into trypanothione reductase: structural analysis of an engineered change in substrate specificity.	Trypanosoma and Leishmania, pathogens responsible for diseases such as African sleeping sickness, Chagas' heart disease, or Oriental sore, are two of the very few genera that do not use the ubiquitous glutathione/glutathione reductase system to keep a stable cellular redox balance. Instead, they rely on trypanothione and trypanothione reductase to protect them from oxidative stress. Trypanothione reductase (TR) and the corresponding host enzyme, human red blood cell glutathione reductase (GR), belong to the same flavoprotein family. Despite their closely related three-dimensional structures and although their natural substrates share the common structural glutathione core, the two enzymes are mutually exclusive with respect to their disulfide substrates. This makes the parasite enzyme a potential target for antitrypanosomal drug design. While a large body of structural data on GR complexes is available, information on TR-ligand interactions is very limited. When the two amino acid changes Ala34Glu and Arg37Trp are introduced into human GR, the resulting mutant enzyme (GRTR) prefers trypanothione 700-fold over its original substrate, effectively converting a GR into a TR [Bradley, M., B|cheler, U. S., & Walsh, C. T. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 6124-6127]. The crystal structure of GRTR has been determined at 2.3 A resolution and refined to a crystallographic R factor of 20.9%. We have taken advantage of the ease with which ligand complexes can be produced in GR crystals, a property that extends to the isomorphous GRTR crystals, and have produced and analyzed crystals of GRTR complexes with glutathione, trypanothione, glutathionylspermidine and of a true catalytic intermediate, the mixed disulfide between trypanothione and the enzyme. The corresponding molecular structures have been characterized at resolutions between 2.3 and 2.8 A with R factors ranging from 17.1 to 19.7%. The results indicate that the Ala34Glu mutation causes steric hindrance leading to a large displacement of the side chain of Arg347. This movement combined with the change in charge introduced by the mutations modifies the binding cavity, forcing glutathione to adopt a nonproductive binding mode and permitting trypanothione and to a certain degree also the weak substrate glutathionylspermidine to assume a productive mode.
16134930	4-Aryl-1,2,3-triazole: a novel template for a reversible methionine aminopeptidase 2 inhibitor, optimized to inhibit angiogenesis in vivo.	Inhibitors of human methionine aminopeptidase type 2 (hMetAP2) are of interest as potential treatments for cancer. A new class of small molecule reversible inhibitors of hMetAP2 was discovered and optimized, the 4-aryl-1,2,3-triazoles. Compound 24, a potent inhibitor of cobalt-activated hMetAP2, also inhibits human and mouse endothelial cell growth. Using a mouse matrigel model, this reversible hMetAP2 inhibitor was also shown to inhibit angiogenesis in vivo.
8383239	WIN 52035-2 inhibits both attachment and eclipse of human rhinovirus 14.	WIN compounds inhibit attachment of human rhinovirus 14 by binding to a hydrophobic pocket within the capsid and inducing conformational changes in the canyon floor, the region that binds the cellular receptor. To study the basis of drug resistance, we isolated and characterized a family of human rhinovirus 14 mutants resistant to WIN 52035-2. Thermostabilization data and single-cycle growth curves provided evidence for two classes of resistant mutants. One class, here called exclusion mutants, showed a marked decrease in drug-binding affinity and was characterized by substitution to bulkier amino acid side chains at two sites lining the hydrophobic pocket. The other class, called compensation mutants, displayed single-amino-acid substitutions in the drug-deformable regions of the canyon; these mutants were able to attach to cells despite the presence of bound drug. A delay in the rise period of the growth curves of compensation mutants indicated a second locus of drug action. WIN 52035-2 was found to inhibit the first step of uncoating, release of VP4. Attempts to identify this site of drug action by using single-step growth curves were obscured by abortive elution of a major fraction of cell-attached virus. The drug had no effect on the rate of this process but did affect the spectrum of particles produced.
12578369	Structural and biochemical exploration of a critical amino acid in human 8-oxoguanine glycosylase.	Members of the HhH-GPD superfamily of DNA glycosylases are responsible for the recognition and removal of damaged nucleobases from DNA. The hallmark of these proteins is a motif comprising a helix-hairpin-helix followed by a Gly/Pro-rich loop and terminating in an invariant, catalytically essential aspartic acid residue. In this study, we have probed the role of this Asp in human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (hOgg1) by mutating it to Asn (D268N), Glu (D268E), and Gln (D268Q). We show that this aspartate plays a dual role, acting both as an N-terminal alpha-helix cap and as a critical residue for catalysis of both base excision and DNA strand cleavage by hOgg1. Mutation of this residue to asparagine, another helix-capping residue, preserves stability of the protein while drastically reducing enzymatic activity. A crystal structure of this mutant is the first to reveal the active site nucleophile Lys249 in the presence of lesion-containing DNA; this structure offers a tantalizing suggestion that base excision may occur by cleavage of the glycosidic bond and then attachment of Lys249. Mutation of the aspartic acid to glutamine and glutamic acid destabilizes the protein fold to a significant extent but, surprisingly, preserves catalytic activity. Crystal structures of these mutants complexed with an unreactive abasic site in DNA reveal these residues to adopt a sterically disfavored helix-capping conformation.
12820884	Structural and functional importance of first-shell metal ligands in the binuclear manganese cluster of arginase I.	Arginase is a binuclear manganese metalloenzyme that hydrolyzes l-arginine to form l-ornithine and urea. The three-dimensional structures of D128E, D128N, D232A, D232C, D234E, H101N, and H101E arginases I have been determined by X-ray crystallographic methods to elucidate the roles of the first-shell metal ligands in the stability and catalytic activity of the enzyme. This work represents the first structure-based dissection of the binuclear manganese cluster using site-directed mutagenesis and X-ray crystallography. Substitution of the metal ligands compromises the catalytic activity of the enzyme, either by the loss or disruption of the metal cluster or the nucleophilic metal-bridging hydroxide ion. However, the substitution of the metal ligands or the reduction of Mn(2+)(A) or Mn(2+)(B) occupancy does not compromise enzyme-substrate affinity as reflected by K(M), which remains relatively invariant across this series of arginase variants. This implicates a nonmetal binding site for substrate l-arginine in the precatalytic Michaelis complex, as proposed based on analysis of the native enzyme structure (Kanyo, Z. F., Scolnick, L. R., Ash, D. E., and Christianson, D. W. (1996) Nature 383, 554-557).
11080143	Crystal structure of the Xrcc4 DNA repair protein and implications for end joining.	XRCC4 is essential for carrying out non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ) in all eukaryotes and, in particular, V(D)J recombination in vertebrates. Xrcc4 protein forms a complex with DNA ligase IV that rejoins two DNA ends in the last step of V(D)J recombination and NHEJ to repair double strand breaks. XRCC4-defective cells are extremely sensitive to ionizing radiation, and disruption of the XRCC4 gene results in embryonic lethality in mice. Here we report the crystal structure of a functional fragment of Xrcc4 at 2.7 A resolution. Xrcc4 protein forms a strikingly elongated dumb-bell-like tetramer. Each of the N-terminal globular head domains consists of a beta-sandwich and a potentially DNA-binding helix- turn-helix motif. The C-terminal stalk comprising a single alpha-helix >120 A in length is partly incorporated into a four-helix bundle in the Xrcc4 tetramer and partly involved in interacting with ligase IV. The Xrcc4 structure suggests a possible mode of coupling ligase IV association with DNA binding for effective ligation of DNA ends.
15819891	Small exterior hydrophobic cluster contributes to conformational stability and steroid binding in ketosteroid isomerase from Pseudomonas putida biotype B.	A structural motif called the small exterior hydrophobic cluster (SEHC) has been proposed to explain the stabilizing effect mediated by solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues; however, little is known about its biological roles. Unusually, in Delta(5)-3-ketosteroid isomerase from Pseudomonas putida biotype B (KSI-PI) Trp92 is exposed to solvent on the protein surface, forming a SEHC with the side-chains of Leu125 and Val127. In order to identify the role of the SEHC in KSI-PI, mutants of those amino acids associated with the SEHC were prepared. The W92A, L125A/V127A, and W92A/L125A/V127A mutations largely decreased the conformational stability, while the L125F/V127F mutation slightly increased the stability, indicating that hydrophobic packing by the SEHC is important in maintaining stability. The crystal structure of W92A revealed that the decreased stability caused by the removal of the bulky side-chain of Trp92 could be attributed to the destabilization of the surface hydrophobic layer consisting of a solvent-exposed beta-sheet. Consistent with the structural data, the binding affinities for three different steroids showed that the surface hydrophobic layer stabilized by SEHC is required for KSI-PI to efficiently recognize hydrophobic steroids. Unfolding kinetics based on analysis of the Phi(U) value also indicated that the SEHC in the native state was resistant to the unfolding process, despite its solvent-exposed site. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the SEHC plays a key role in the structural integrity that is needed for KSI-PI to stabilize the hydrophobic surface conformation and thereby contributes both to the overall conformational stability and to the binding of hydrophobic steroids in water solution.
10545177	Role of disulfide bonds in the structure and potassium channel blocking activity of ShK toxin.	ShK toxin, a potassium channel blocker from the sea anemone Stichodactyla helianthus, is a 35 residue polypeptide cross-linked by three disulfide bridges: Cys3-Cys35, Cys12-Cys28, and Cys17-Cys32. To investigate the role of these disulfides in the structure and channel-blocking activity of ShK toxin, a series of analogues was synthesized by selective replacement of each pair of half-cystines with two alpha-amino-butyrate (Abu) residues. The remaining two disulfide pairs were formed unambiguously using an orthogonal protecting group strategy of Cys(Trt) or Cys(Acm) at the appropriate position. The peptides were tested in vitro for their ability to block Kv1.1 and Kv1.3 potassium channels and their ability to displace [(125)I]dendrotoxin binding to rat brain synaptosomal membranes. The monocyclic peptides showed no activity in these assays. Of the dicyclic peptides, [Abu12,28]ShK(3-35,17)(-)(32) (where the subscript indicates disulfide connectivities) had weak activity on Kv1.3 and Kv1.1. [Abu17,32]ShK(3-35,12)(-)(28) blocked Kv1.3 with low nanomolar potency, but was less effective (being comparable to [Abu12,28]ShK(3-35,17)(-)(32)) against Kv1.1. [Abu3, 35]ShK(12-28,17)(-)(32), retained high picomolar affinity against both channels. Corroborating these results, [Abu3,35]ShK(12-28, 17)(-)(32) had an IC(50) ratio relative to native toxin of 18 in the displacement assay, whereas [Abu17,32]ShK(3-35,12)(-)(28) and [Abu12, 28]ShK(3-35,17)(-)(32) had ratios of 69 and 390, respectively. Thus, the disulfide bond linking the N- and C-terminal regions is less important for activity than the internal disulfides. NMR analysis of the [Abu12,28] and [Abu17,32] analogues indicated that they had little residual structure, consistent with their significantly reduced activities. By contrast, [Abu3,35]ShK(12-28,17)(-)(32) had a moderately well-defined solution structure, with a mean pairwise root-mean-square deviation of 1.33 A over the backbone heavy atoms. This structure nevertheless showed significant differences from that of native ShK toxin. The possible interactions of this analogue with the channel and the distinction between native secondary and tertiary structure on one hand and global topology imposed by the disulfide bridges on the other are discussed.
11875520	The crystal structure of class II ribonucleotide reductase reveals how an allosterically regulated monomer mimics a dimer.	Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) catalyze the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides, an essential step in DNA biosynthesis and repair. Here we present the crystal structure of class II (coenzyme B12-dependent) ribonucleoside triphosphate reductase (RTPR) from Lactobacillus leichmannii in the apo enzyme form and in complex with the B12 analog adeninylpentylcobalamin at 1.75 and 2.0 A resolution, respectively. This monomeric, allosterically regulated class II RNR retains all the key structural features associated with the catalytic and regulatory machinery of oligomeric RNRs. Surprisingly, the dimer interface responsible for effector binding in class I RNR is preserved through a single 130-residue insertion in the class II structure. Thus, L. leichmannii RNR is a paradigm for the simplest structural entity capable of ribonucleotide reduction, a reaction linking the RNA and DNA worlds.
7788295	Solution structure of human thioredoxin in a mixed disulfide intermediate complex with its target peptide from the transcription factor NF kappa B.	BACKGROUND: Human thioredoxin is a 12 kDa cellular redox protein that plays a key role in maintaining the redox environment of the cell. It has recently been shown to be responsible for activating the DNA-binding properties of the cellular transcription factor, NF kappa B, by reducing a disulfide bond involving Cys62 of the p50 subunit. Using multidimensional heteronuclear-edited and hetero-nuclear-filtered NMR spectroscopy, we have solved the solution structure of a complex of human thioredoxin and a 13-residue peptide extending from residues 56-68 of p50, representing a kinetically stable mixed disulfide intermediate along the reaction pathway. RESULTS: The NF kappa B peptide is located in a long boot-shaped cleft on the surface of human thioredoxin delineated by the active-site loop, helices alpha 2, alpha 3 and alpha 4, and strands beta 3 and beta 4. The peptide adopts a crescent-like conformation with a smooth 110 degrees bend centered around residue 60 which permits it to follow the path of the cleft. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the intermolecular disulfide bridge between Cys32 of human thioredoxin and Cys62 of the peptide, the complex is stabilized by numerous hydrogen-bonding, electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions which involve residues 57-65 of the NF kappa B peptide and confer substrate specificity. These structural features permit one to suggest the specificity requirements for human thioredoxin-catalyzed disulfide bond reduction of proteins.
9632735	TorD, a cytoplasmic chaperone that interacts with the unfolded trimethylamine N-oxide reductase enzyme (TorA) in Escherichia coli.	Reduction of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in Escherichia coli involves the terminal molybdoreductase TorA, located in the periplasm, and the membrane anchored c type cytochrome TorC. In this study, the role of the TorD protein, encoded by the third gene of torCAD operon, is investigated. Construction of a mutant, in which the torD gene is interrupted, showed that the absence of TorD protein leads to a two times decrease of the final amount of TorA enzyme. However, specific activity and biochemical properties of TorA enzyme were similar to those of the enzyme produced in the wild type. Excess of TorD protein restores the normal level of TorA enzyme, and also, leads to the appearance of a new cytoplasmic form of TorA on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using gentle conditions. This probably indicates a new folding state of the cytoplasmic TorA protein when TorD is overexpressed. BIAcore techniques demonstrated direct specific interaction between the TorA and TorD proteins. This interaction was enhanced when TorA was previously unfolded by heating. Finally, as TorA is a molybdoenzyme, we demonstrated that TorD can interact with TorA before the molybdenum cofactor has been inserted. As TorD homologue encoding genes are found in various TMAO reductase loci, we propose that TorD is a chaperone protein specific for the TorA enzyme. It belongs to a family of TorD-like chaperones present in several bacteria, and, probably, involved in TMAO reductase folding.
15654077	Solution structure of enzyme IIA(Chitobiose) from the N,N'-diacetylchitobiose branch of the Escherichia coli phosphotransferase system.	The solution structure of trimeric Escherichia coli enzyme IIA(Chb) (34 kDa), a component of the N,N'-diacetylchitobiose/lactose branch of the phosphotransferase signal transduction system, has been determined by NMR spectroscopy. Backbone residual dipolar couplings were used to provide long range orientational restraints, and long range (|i - j| > or = 5 residues) nuclear Overhauser enhancement restraints were derived exclusively from samples in which at least one subunit was 15N/13C/2H/(Val-Leu-Ile)-methyl-protonated. Each subunit consists of a three-helix bundle. Hydrophobic residues lining helix 3 of each subunit are largely responsible for the formation of a parallel coiled-coil trimer. The active site histidines (His-89 from each subunit) are located in three symmetrically placed deep crevices located at the interface of two adjacent subunits (A and C, C and B, and B and A). Partially shielded from bulk solvent, structural modeling suggests that phosphorylated His-89 is stabilized by electrostatic interactions with the side chains of His-93 from the same subunit and Gln-91 from the adjacent subunit. Comparison with the x-ray structure of Lactobacillus lactis IIA(Lac) reveals some substantial structural differences, particularly in regard to helix 3, which exhibits a 40 degrees kink in IIA(Lac) versus a 7 degrees bend in IIA(Chb). This is associated with the presence of an unusually large (230-angstroms3) buried hydrophobic cavity at the trimer interface in IIA(Lac) that is reduced to only 45 angstroms3) in IIA(Chb).
7568230	Structures of the apo- and the metal ion-activated forms of the diphtheria tox repressor from Corynebacterium diphtheriae.	The diphtheria tox repressor (DtxR) of Corynebacterium diphtheriae plays a critical role in the regulation of diphtheria toxin expression and the control of other iron-sensitive genes. The crystal structures of apo-DtxR and of the metal ion-activated form of the repressor have been solved and used to identify motifs involved in DNA and metal ion binding. Residues involved in binding of the activated repressor to the diphtheria tox operator, glutamine 43, arginine 47, and arginine 50, were located and confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. Previous biochemical and genetic data can be explained in terms of these structures. Conformational differences between apo- and Ni-DtxR are discussed with regard to the mechanism of action of this repressor.
2499260	S-adenosyl-L-methionine:trans-caffeoyl-coenzyme A 3-O-methyltransferase from elicitor-treated parsley cell suspension cultures.	An S-adenosyl-L-methionine:caffeoyl-CoA 3-O-methyltransferase was purified 82-fold from elicitor-induced parsley cell suspension cultures by ammonium sulfate fractionation, anionic exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatographies, and chromatofocusing. The enzyme has an apparent pI of 5.7 and a molecular weight of approx 48,000 determined by gel filtration chromatography. Maximal activity was observed at pH 7.5 in 50 mM phosphate or Tris-HCl buffers and the additional presence of 0.5 M NaCl. The methyltransferase activity was dependent on Mg2+, whereas EDTA, Mn2+, and Ca2+ inhibited the reaction. The partially purified enzyme efficiently catalyzed the methylation of caffeoyl-CoA, but also accepted with low affinity various other caffeic esters as substrates. Dark-grown parsley cells contained considerable methyltransferase activity which was nevertheless increased approx threefold within 12 h following the addition of a crude fungal elicitor to the cell suspensions. We propose that the O-methyltransferase activity is an important component in the rapid resistance response of the cells, which depends on the formation of cell wall-bound ferulic polymers.
12679341	Roles of calcium ions in the activation and activity of the transglutaminase 3 enzyme.	The transglutaminase 3 enzyme is widely expressed in many tissues including epithelia. We have shown previously that it can bind three Ca2+ ions, which in site one is constitutively bound, while those in sites two and three are acquired during activation and are required for activity. In particular, binding at site three opens a channel through the enzyme and exposes two tryptophan residues near the active site that are thought to be important for enzyme reaction. In this study, we have solved the structures of three more forms of this enzyme by x-ray crystallography in the presence of Ca2+ and/or Mg2+, which provide new insights on the precise contribution of each Ca2+ ion to activation and activity. First, we found that Ca2+ ion in site one can be exchanged with difficulty, and it has a binding affinity of Kd = 0.3 microm (DeltaH = -6.70 +/- 0.52 kcal/mol), which suggests it is important for the stabilization of the enzyme. Site two can be occupied by some lanthanides but only Ca2+ of the Group 2 family of alkali earth metals, and its occupancy are required for activity. Site three can be occupied by some lanthanides, Ca2+,or Mg2+; however, when Mg2+ is present, the enzyme is inactive, and the channel is closed. Thus Ca2+ binding in both sites two and three cooperate in opening the channel. We speculate that manipulation of the channel opening could be controlled by intracellular cation levels. Together, these data have important implications for reaction mechanism of the enzyme: the opening of a channel perhaps controls access to and manipulation of substrates at the active site.
7592925	Mechanism of regulation in yeast glycogen phosphorylase.	The mechanism of yeast glycogen phosphorylase activation by covalent phosphorylation involves structural elements distinct from the mammalian homologs. To understand the role of the amino-terminal 39-residue extension in the phosphorylation control mechanism, mutants with 22 and 42 amino-terminal residues removed were expressed in Escherichia coli, and their properties were compared with the wild-type (WT) enzyme. The unphosphorylated WT enzyme had a specific activity of 0.1 unit/mg and was not activated significantly by the substrate, glucose 1-phosphate. Phosphorylation by protein kinase resulted in a 1300-fold activation. Glucose 6-phosphate inhibited the unphosphorylated enzyme more effectively than the phosphorylated form, and inhibition of the latter was cooperative. Glucose was a poor inhibitor for both the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated WT enzyme with Ki > 300 mM. The rate of phosphorylation by protein kinase depended on substrates and interactions of the amino terminus. Maltoheptaose increased the rate of phosphorylation of the WT enzyme by yeast phosphorylase kinase 5-fold. The 22-residue deletion mutant (Nd22) had overall kinetic properties similar to the WT enzyme, except that Nd22 was a better substrate for the protein kinase and the rate of phosphorylation was unaffected by maltoheptaose. The 42-residue deletion mutant (Nd42), which lacks the phosphorylation site, was measurably active, although much less active than phosphorylated WT. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis indicated that the WT, Nd22, and Nd42 exist as tetramer, partially dissociated tetramer, and dimer, respectively. Phosphorylation of the WT and Nd22 converted both to dimer. The results indicated that the amino terminus affects quaternary structure and mediates activity regulation through conformational transition.
11916385	Solution structure of protein SRP19 of Archaeoglobus fulgidus signal recognition particle.	Protein SRP19 is an essential RNA-binding component of the signal recognition particle (SRP) in Archaea and Eucarya. A three-dimensional solution structure of the 104 residue SRP19 from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus, designated as Af19, was determined by NMR spectroscopy. Af19 contains three beta-strands, two alpha-helical regions, arranged in a betaalphabetabetaalpha topology, a 3(10) helix, and a disordered C-terminal tail. This fold is similar to the betaalphabetabetaalphabeta RNP motif present in numerous other RNA-binding proteins, which engage their cognate RNAs using conserved sequence motifs present within beta-strands 1 and 3. Mutagenesis studies of human SRP19, however, reveal the major contact sites with SRP RNA reside within loops 1, 3, and 4. These contacts were verified by the crystal structure of human SRP19 complexed to SRP RNA helix 6 reported subsequent to the submission of the manuscript. The crystal structure also reveals that, unlike canonical RNP motifs, SRP19 does not engage specific RNA bases through conserved sequence motifs present within beta-strands 1 and 3. Instead, SRP19 uses residues both within and flanking beta-strand 1 to stabilize the complex through direct and indirect contacts to the phosphate backbone of the tetraloop, leaving the bases of the tetraloop exposed. This, coupled with the fact that SRP19 appears relatively rigid and undergoes only minor changes in structure upon RNA binding, may underlie the molecular basis by which SRP19 functions to initiate SRP assembly.
15731407	Crystal structure of the malaria vaccine candidate apical membrane antigen 1.	Apical membrane antigen 1 from Plasmodium is a leading malaria vaccine candidate. The protein is essential for host-cell invasion, but its molecular function is unknown. The crystal structure of the three domains comprising the ectoplasmic region of the antigen from P. vivax, solved at 1.8 angstrom resolution, shows that domains I and II belong to the PAN motif, which defines a superfamily of protein folds implicated in receptor binding. We also mapped the epitope of an invasion-inhibitory monoclonal antibody specific for the P. falciparum ortholog and modeled this to the structure. The location of the epitope and current knowledge on structure-function correlations for PAN domains together suggest a receptor-binding role during invasion in which domain II plays a critical part. These results are likely to aid vaccine and drug design.
2092358	The cellobiose permease of Escherichia coli consists of three proteins and is homologous to the lactose permease of Staphylococcus aureus.	The cellobiose (cel) operon of Escherichia coli was recently sequenced and shown to consist of five genes, celABCDF (Parker and Hall, 1990). We have shown that the CelA, CelB and CelC proteins possess amino acid sequences which are homologous to different domains of the lactose permease of Staphylococcus aureus. CelB corresponds to the integral membrane portion of the permease (IIcel) while CelC (IIIcel) and CelA (IVcel) correspond to the two cytoplasmic domains which appear to comprise the first and second phosphorylation sites in the permease, respectively. The cellobiose permease is the only one of several homologous sequenced permeases of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system which has its three known functional domains residing on distinct polypeptide chains.
11306569	Amylosucrase, a glucan-synthesizing enzyme from the alpha-amylase family.	Amylosucrase (E.C. 2.4.1.4) is a member of Family 13 of the glycoside hydrolases (the alpha-amylases), although its biological function is the synthesis of amylose-like polymers from sucrose. The structure of amylosucrase from Neisseria polysaccharea is divided into five domains: an all helical N-terminal domain that is not similar to any known fold, a (beta/alpha)(8)-barrel A-domain, B- and B'-domains displaying alpha/beta-structure, and a C-terminal eight-stranded beta-sheet domain. In contrast to other Family 13 hydrolases that have the active site in the bottom of a large cleft, the active site of amylosucrase is at the bottom of a pocket at the molecular surface. A substrate binding site resembling the amylase 2 subsite is not found in amylosucrase. The site is blocked by a salt bridge between residues in the second and eight loops of the (beta/alpha)(8)-barrel. The result is an exo-acting enzyme. Loop 7 in the amylosucrase barrel is prolonged compared with the loop structure found in other hydrolases, and this insertion (forming domain B') is suggested to be important for the polymer synthase activity of the enzyme. The topology of the B'-domain creates an active site entrance with several ravines in the molecular surface that could be used specifically by the substrates/products (sucrose, glucan polymer, and fructose) that have to get in and out of the active site pocket.
7545077	Structure of HIV-1 RT/TIBO R 86183 complex reveals similarity in the binding of diverse nonnucleoside inhibitors.	We report the structure of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) complexed with the nonnucleoside inhibitor TIBO R 86183 at 3.0 A resolution. Comparing this structure with those of complexes of HIV-1 RT/alpha-APA R 95845 and HIV-1 RT/nevirapine provides a basis for understanding the nature of nonnucleoside inhibitor binding, the structure of the binding site and the interactions between the bound inhibitors and surrounding amino acid residues as well as for understanding mechanisms of inhibition by and resistance to nonnucleoside inhibitors. All three inhibitors considered assume a similar butterfly-like shape and bind to HIV-1 RT in a very similar way. Important differences occur in the conformation of amino acid residues that form the binding pocket.
15644204	Tracking the evolution of porphobilinogen synthase metal dependence in vitro.	Metal ions are indispensable cofactors for chemical catalysis by a plethora of enzymes. Porphobilinogen synthases (PBGSs), which catalyse the second step of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis, are grouped according to their dependence on Zn(2+). Using site-directed mutagenesis, we embarked on transforming Zn(2+)-independent Pseudomonas aeruginosa PBGS into a Zn(2+)-dependent enzyme. Nine PBGS variants were generated by permutationally introducing three cysteine residues and a further two residues into the active site of the enzyme to match the homologous Zn(2+)-containing PBGS from Escherichia coli. Crystal structures of seven enzyme variants were solved to elucidate the nature of Zn(2+) coordination at high resolution. The three single-cysteine variants were invariably found to be enzymatically inactive and only one (D139C) was found to bind detectable amounts of Zn(2+). The double mutant A129C/D139C is enzymatically active and binds Zn(2+) in a tetrahedral coordination. Structurally and functionally it mimics mycobacterial PBGS, which bears an equivalent Zn(2+)-coordination site. The remaining two double mutants, without known natural equivalents, reveal strongly distorted tetrahedral Zn(2+)-binding sites. Variant A129C/D131C possesses weak PBGS activity while D131C/D139C is inactive. The triple mutant A129C/D131C/D139C, finally, displays an almost ideal tetrahedral Zn(2+)-binding geometry and a significant Zn(2+)-dependent enzymatic activity. Two additional amino acid exchanges further optimize the active site architecture towards the E.coli enzyme with an additional increase in activity. Our study delineates the potential evolutionary path between Zn(2+)-free and Zn(2+)-dependent PBGS enyzmes showing that the rigid backbone of PBGS enzymes is an ideal framework to create or eliminate metal dependence through a limited number of amino acid exchanges.
15501821	Crystal structure of human maspin, a serpin with antitumor properties: reactive center loop of maspin is exposed but constrained.	Maspin, a member of the serpin superfamily, has tumor suppressing activity against breast and prostate cancer. Maspin inhibits tumor growth by blocking cell invasion, and its reactive center loop (RCL) is thought to mediate this activity. To understand this function on the molecular level, we have solved the three-dimensional structure of Maspin to 3.1 A resolution. The molecular structure shows the characteristic features of the serpin fold, but the RCL of Maspin is unique in length, composition, and placement. Although the RCL of Maspin is accessible and cleavable by some proteinases, it functions in the uncleaved, constrained conformation observed here. These structural results will contribute to our understanding of the mechanism by which Maspin suppresses tumors.
10207002	Quantitative and qualitative analysis of type III antifreeze protein structure and function.	Some cold water marine fishes avoid cellular damage because of freezing by expressing antifreeze proteins (AFPs) that bind to ice and inhibit its growth; one such protein is the globular type III AFP from eel pout. Despite several studies, the mechanism of ice binding remains unclear because of the difficulty in modeling the AFP-ice interaction. To further explore the mechanism, we have determined the x-ray crystallographic structure of 10 type III AFP mutants and combined that information with 7 previously determined structures to mainly analyze specific AFP-ice interactions such as hydrogen bonds. Quantitative assessment of binding was performed using a neural network with properties of the structure as input and predicted antifreeze activity as output. Using the cross-validation method, a correlation coefficient of 0.60 was obtained between measured and predicted activity, indicating successful learning and good predictive power. A large loss in the predictive power of the neural network occurred after properties related to the hydrophobic surface were left out, suggesting that van der Waal's interactions make a significant contribution to ice binding. By combining the analysis of the neural network with antifreeze activity and x-ray crystallographic structures of the mutants, we extend the existing ice-binding model to a two-step process: 1) probing of the surface for the correct ice-binding plane by hydrogen-bonding side chains and 2) attractive van der Waal's interactions between the other residues of the ice-binding surface and the ice, which increases the strength of the protein-ice interaction.
14514675	Electrostatic environment at the active site of prolyl oligopeptidase is highly influential during substrate binding.	The positive electrostatic environment of the active site of prolyl oligopeptidase was investigated by using substrates with glutamic acid at positions P2, P3, P4, and P5, respectively. The different substrates gave various pH rate profiles. The pKa values extracted from the curves are apparent parameters, presumably affected by the nearby charged residues, and do not reflect the ionization of a simple catalytic histidine as found in the classic serine peptidases like chymotrypsin and subtilisin. The temperature dependence of kcat/Km did not produce linear Arrhenius plots, indicating different changes in the individual rate constants with the increase in temperature. This rendered it possible to calculate these constants, i.e. the formation (k1) and decomposition (k-1) of the enzyme-substrate complex and the acylation constant (k2), as well as the corresponding activation energies. The results have revealed the relationship between the complex Michaelis parameters and the individual rate constants. Structure determination of the enzyme-substrate complexes has shown that the different substrates display a uniform binding mode. None of the glutamic acids interacts with a charged group. We conclude that the specific rate constant is controlled by k1 rather than k2 and that the charged residues from the substrate and the enzyme can markedly affect the formation but not the structure of the enzyme-substrate complexes.
11827530	Exploring the role and the binding affinity of a second zinc equivalent in B. cereus metallo-beta-lactamase.	Metallo-beta-lactamases are a newly characterized family of zinc enzymes present in several pathogenic strains that represent an emerging clinical threat. Enzymes from different organisms exhibit an outstanding functional diversity, particularly in the metal ion requirements for activity. We have investigated the effect of the second zinc(II) equivalent in the enzyme betaLII from Bacillus cereus, naturally active in the mono-zinc(II) form. The enzyme is reversibly inactivated at low pH, due to dissociation of the two zinc(II) equivalents. The pH profile indicates that zinc-bound water in the mono-zinc(II) enzyme possesses a pK(a) below 4.9, indicating that a second zinc(II) equivalent is not needed for nucleophile activation. Instead, the second zinc(II) may contribute to properly anchor Asp120, that ultimately orients the attacking nucleophile in binuclear enzymes. This role may be fulfilled by Arg121 in mono-zinc enzymes, as suggested by the kinetic study of the R121C mutant in betaLII. In addition, it is demonstrated that Arg121 is not responsible for the low binding affinity of betaLII toward a second zinc(II) equivalent.
2061330	The crystal structure of a mutant human lysozyme C77/95A with increased secretion efficiency in yeast.	The three-dimensional structure of a mutant human lysozyme, C77/95A, in which residues Cys77 and Cys95 were replaced by alanine, was determined at 1.8-A resolution by x-ray crystallography. The properties of this mutant protein have been well characterized with respect to its thermal stability and secretion efficiency in a yeast expression system. The overall three-dimensional structure of C77/95A was found to be essentially identical to that of the wild-type human lysozyme, although the coordinates were shifted by more than 0.5 A and the thermal factors of the main-chain atoms were increased in the vicinity of residue 77. The reduction in thermal stability of this mutant has been previously explained by an increase in entropy of the unfolded state. In addition, a packing defect (cavity) produced by the removal of the disulfide bond was detected in the three-dimensional structure of C77/95A. This cavity can also be a reason why the stability of the protein is reduced because the free energy of the folded state could be expected to increase. The increased secretion efficiency cannot be due mainly to the three-dimensional structure, but may possibly be related to some event in the pathway of protein secretion. One of the possibilities might involve molecular flexibilities in the secondary or tertiary structure for lack of one of the disulfide bonds.
15062092	X-Ray structure determination of three mutants of the bacterial photosynthetic reaction centers from Rb. sphaeroides; altered proton transfer pathways.	In the photosynthetic reaction center (RC) from Rhodobacter sphaeroides, the reduction of a bound quinone molecule Q(B) is coupled with proton uptake. When Asp-L213 is replaced by Asn, proton transfer is inhibited. Proton transfer was restored by two second-site revertant mutations, Arg-M233-->Cys and Arg-H177-->His. Kinetic effects of Cd(2+) on proton transfer showed that the entry point in revertant RCs to be the same as in the native RC. The structures of the parental and two revertant RCs were determined at resolutions of 2.10, 1.80, and 2.75 A. From the structures, we were able to delineate alternate proton transfer pathways in the revertants. The main changes occur near Glu-H173, which allow it to substitute for the missing Asp-L213. The electrostatic changes near Glu-H173 cause it to be a good proton donor and acceptor, and the structural changes create a cavity which accommodates water molecules that connect Glu-H173 to other proton transfer components.
10702294	Re-engineering of human urokinase provides a system for structure-based drug design at high resolution and reveals a novel structural subsite.	Inhibition of urokinase has been shown to slow tumor growth and metastasis. To utilize structure-based drug design, human urokinase was re-engineered to provide a more optimal crystal form. The redesigned protein consists of residues Ile(16)-Lys(243) (in the chymotrypsin numbering system; for the urokinase numbering system it is Ile(159)-Lys(404)) and two point mutations, C122A and N145Q (C279A and N302Q). The protein yields crystals that diffract to ultra-high resolution at a synchrotron source. The native structure has been refined to 1.5 A resolution. This new crystal form contains an accessible active site that facilitates compound soaking, which was used to determine the co-crystal structures of urokinase in complex with the small molecule inhibitors amiloride, 4-iodo-benzo(b)thiophene-2-carboxamidine and phenylguanidine at 2. 0-2.2 A resolution. All three inhibitors bind at the primary binding pocket of urokinase. The structures of amiloride and 4-iodo-benzo(b)thiophene-2-carboxamidine also reveal that each of their halogen atoms are bound at a novel structural subsite adjacent to the primary binding pocket. This site consists of residues Gly(218), Ser(146), and Cys(191)-Cys(220) and the side chain of Lys(143). This pocket could be utilized in future drug design efforts. Crystal structures of these three inhibitors in complex with urokinase reveal strategies for the design of more potent nonpeptidic urokinase inhibitors.
11124036	Structure-activity relationships in a peptidic alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist.	alpha-Conotoxins are small disulfide-constrained peptide toxins which act as antagonists at specific subtypes of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nACh receptors). In this study, we analyzed the structures and activities of three mutants of alpha-conotoxin ImI, a 12 amino acid peptide active at alpha7 nACh receptors, in order to gain insight into the primary and tertiary structural requirements of neuronal alpha-conotoxin specificity. NMR solution structures were determined for mutants R11E, R7L, and D5N, resulting in representative ensembles of 20 conformers with average pairwise RMSD values of 0.46, 0.52, and 0.62 A from their mean structures, respectively, for the backbone atoms N, C(alpha), and C' of residues 2-11. The R11E mutant was found to have activity near that of wild-type ImI, while R7L and D5N demonstrated activities reduced by at least two orders of magnitude. Comparison of the structures reveals a common two-loop architecture, with variations observed in backbone and side-chain dihedral angles as well as surface electrostatic potentials upon mutation. Correlation of these structures and activities with those from previously published studies emphasizes that existing hypotheses regarding the molecular determinants of alpha-conotoxin specificity are not adequate for explaining peptide activity, and suggests that more subtle features, visualized here at the atomic level, are important for receptor binding. These data, in conjunction with reported characterizations of the acetylcholine binding site, support a model of toxin activity in which a single solvent-accessible toxin side-chain anchors the complex, with supporting weak interactions determining both the efficacy and the subtype specificity of the inhibitory activity.
7479879	Crystal structure of Pseudomonas aeruginosa catabolic ornithine transcarbamoylase at 3.0-A resolution: a different oligomeric organization in the transcarbamoylase family.	The crystal structure of the Glu-105-->Gly mutant of catabolic ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTCase; carbamoyl phosphate + L-ornithine = orthophosphate + L-citrulline, EC 2.1.3.3) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been determined at 3.0-A resolution. This mutant is blocked in the active R (relaxed) state. The structure was solved by the molecular replacement method, starting from a crude molecular model built from a trimer of the catalytic subunit of another transcarbamoylase, the extensively studied aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) from Escherichia coli. This model was used to generate initial low-resolution phases at 8-A resolution, which were extended to 3-A by noncrystallographic symmetry averaging. Four phase extensions were required to obtain an electron density map of very high quality from which the final model was built. The structure, including 4020 residues, has been refined to 3-A, and the current crystallographic R value is 0.216. No solvent molecules have been added to the model. The catabolic OTCase is a dodecamer composed of four trimers organized in a tetrahedral manner. Each monomer is composed of two domains. The carbamoyl phosphate binding domain shows a strong structural homology with the equivalent ATCase part. In contrast, the other domain, mainly implicated in the binding of the second substrate (ornithine for OTCase and aspartate for ATCase) is poorly conserved. The quaternary structures of these two allosteric transcarbamoylases are quite divergent: the E. coli ATCase has pseudo-32 point-group symmetry, with six catalytic and six regulatory chains; the catabolic OTCase has 23 point-group symmetry and only catalytic chains. However, both enzymes display homotropic and heterotropic cooperativity.

9546221	The crystal structure of Dps, a ferritin homolog that binds and protects DNA.	The crystal structure of Dps, a DNA-binding protein from starved E. coli that protects DNA from oxidative damage, has been solved at 1.6 A resolution. The Dps monomer has essentially the same fold as ferritin, which forms a 24-mer with 432 symmetry, a hollow core and pores at the three-fold axes. Dps forms a dodecamer with 23 (tetrahedral) point group symmetry which also has a hollow core and pores at the three-folds. The structure suggests a novel DNA-binding motif and a mechanism for DNA protection based on the sequestration of Fe ions.
10210191	Structural comparisons of TIM barrel proteins suggest functional and evolutionary relationships between beta-galactosidase and other glycohydrolases.	Beta-galactosidase (lacZ) from Escherichia coli is a 464 kDa homotetramer. Each subunit consists of five domains, the third being an alpha/beta barrel that contains most of the active site residues. A comparison is made between each of the domains and a large set of proteins representative of all structures from the protein data bank. Many structures include an alpha/beta barrel. Those that are most similar to the alpha/beta barrel of E. coli beta-galactosidase have similar catalytic residues and belong to the so-called "4/7 superfamily" of glycosyl hydrolases. The structure comparison suggests that beta-amylase should also be included in this family. Of three structure comparison methods tested, the "ProSup" procedure of Zu-Kang and Sippl and the "Superimpose" procedure of Diederichs were slightly superior in discriminating the members of this superfamily, although all procedures were very powerful in identifying related protein structures. Domains 1, 2, and 4 of E. coli beta-galactosidase have topologies related to "jelly-roll barrels" and "immunoglobulin constant" domains. This fold also occurs in the cellulose binding domains (CBDs) of a number of glycosyl hydrolases. The fold of domain 1 of E. coli beta-galactosidase is closely related to some CBDs, and the domain contributes to substrate binding, but in a manner unrelated to cellulose binding by the CBDs. This is typical of domains 1, 2, 4, and 5, which appear to have been recruited to play roles in beta-galactosidase that are unrelated to the functions that such domains provide in other contexts. It is proposed that beta-galactosidase arose from a prototypical single domain alpha/beta barrel with an extended active site cleft. The subsequent incorporation of elements from other domains could then have reduced the size of the active site from a cleft to a pocket to better hydrolyze the disaccharide lactose and, at the same time, to facilitate the production of inducer, allolactose.
2542566	Genetic and molecular analyses of spontaneous mutants of human rhinovirus 14 that are resistant to an antiviral compound.	Spontaneous mutants of human rhinovirus 14 resistant to WIN 52084, an antiviral compound that inhibits attachment to cells, were isolated by selecting plaques that developed when wild-type virus was plated in the presence of high (2 micrograms/ml) or low (0.1 to 0.4 micrograms/ml) concentrations of the compound. Two classes of drug resistance were observed: a high-resistance (HR) class with a frequency of about 4 x 10(-5), and a low-resistance (LR) class with a 10- to 30-fold-higher frequency. The RNA genomes of 56 HR mutants and 13 LR mutants were sequenced in regions encoding the drug-binding site. The HR mutations mapped to only 2 of the 16 amino acid residues that form the walls of the drug-binding pocket. The side chains of these two residues point directly into the pocket and were invariably replaced by bulkier groups. These findings, and patterns of resistance to related WIN compounds, support the concept that HR mutations may hinder the entry or seating of drug within the binding pocket. In contrast, all of the LR mutations mapped to portions of the polypeptide chain near the canyon floor that move when the drug is inserted. Because several LR mutations partially reverse the attachment-inhibiting effect of WIN compounds, these mutants provide useful tools for studying the regions of the capsid structure involved in attachment. This paper shows that the method of escape mutant analysis, previously used to identify antibody binding sites on human rhinovirus 14, is also applicable to analysis of antiviral drug activity.
8673607	A ligand-gated, hinged loop rearrangement opens a channel to a buried artificial protein cavity.	Conformational changes that gate the access of substrates or ligands to an active site are important features of enzyme function. In this report, we describe an unusual example of a structural rearrangement near a buried artificial cavity in cytochrome c peroxidase that occurs on binding protonated benzimidazole. A hinged main-chain rotation at two residues (Pro 190 and Asn 195) results in a surface loop rearrangement that opens a large solvent-accessible channel for the entry of ligands to an otherwise inaccessible binding site. The trapping of this alternate conformational state provides a unique view of the extent to which protein dynamics can allow small molecule penetration into buried protein cavities.
14744126	Tazobactam forms a stoichiometric trans-enamine intermediate in the E166A variant of SHV-1 beta-lactamase: 1.63 A crystal structure.	Many pathogenic bacteria develop antibiotic resistance by utilizing beta-lactamases to degrade penicillin-like antibiotics. A commonly prescribed mechanism-based inhibitor of beta-lactamases is tazobactam, which can function either irreversibly or in a transient manner. We have demonstrated previously that the reaction between tazobactam and a deacylation deficient variant of SHV-1 beta-lactamase, E166A, could be followed in single crystals using Raman microscopy [Helfand, M. S., et al. (2003) Biochemistry 42, 13386-13392]. The Raman data show that maximal populations of an enamine-like intermediate occur 20-30 min after "soaking in" has commenced. By flash-freezing crystals in this time frame, we were able to trap the enamine species. The resulting 1.63 A resolution crystal structure revealed tazobactam covalently bound in the trans-enamine intermediate state with close to 100% occupancy in the active site. The Raman data also indicated that tazobactam forms a larger population of enamine than sulbactam or clavulanic acid does and that tazobactam's intermediate is also the most long-lived. The crystal structure provides a rationale for this finding since only tazobactam is able to form favorable intra- and intermolecular interactions in the active site that stabilize this trans-enamine intermediate. These interactions involve both the sulfone and triazolyl groups that distinguish tazobactam from clavulanic acid and sulbactam, respectively. The observed stabilization of the transient intermediate of tazobactam is thought to contribute to tazobactam's superior in vitro and in vivo clinical efficacy. Understanding the structural details of differing inhibitor effectiveness can aid the design of improved mechanism-based beta-lactamase inhibitors.
10811642	Catalytic roles for two water bridged residues (Asp-98 and His-255) in the active site of copper-containing nitrite reductase.	Two active site residues, Asp-98 and His-255, of copper-containing nitrite reductase (NIR) from Alcaligenes faecalis have been mutated to probe the catalytic mechanism. Three mutations at these two sites (D98N, H255D, and H255N) result in large reductions in activity relative to native NIR, suggesting that both residues are involved intimately in the reaction mechanism. Crystal structures of these mutants have been determined using data collected to better than 1. 9-A resolution. In the native structure, His-255 Nepsilon2 forms a hydrogen bond through a bridging water molecule to the side chain of Asp-98, which also forms a hydrogen bond to a water or nitrite oxygen ligated to the active site copper. In the D98N mutant, reorientation of the Asn-98 side chain results in the loss of the hydrogen bond to the copper ligand water, consistent with a negatively charged Asp-98 directing the binding and protonation of nitrite in the native enzyme. An additional solvent molecule is situated between residues 255 and the bridging water in the H255N and H255D mutants and likely inhibits nitrite binding. The interaction of His-255 with the bridging water appears to be necessary for catalysis and may donate a proton to reaction intermediates in addition to Asp-98.
11023780	Increasing the thermostability of staphylococcal nuclease: implications for the origin of protein thermostability.	Seven hyper-stable multiple mutants have been constructed in staphylococcal nuclease by various combinations of eight different stabilizing single mutants. The stabilities of these multiple mutants determined by guanidine hydrochloride denaturation were 3.4 to 5.6 kcal/mol higher than that of the wild-type. Their thermal denaturation midpoint temperatures were 12.6 to 22.9 deg. C higher than that of the wild-type. These are among the greatest increases in protein stability and thermal denaturation midpoint temperature relative to the wild-type yet attained. There has been great interest in understanding how proteins found in thermophilic organisms are stabilized. One frequently cited theory is that the packing of hydrophobic side-chains is improved in the cores of proteins isolated from thermophiles when compared to proteins from mesophiles. The crystal structures of four single and five multiple stabilizing mutants of staphylococcal nuclease were solved to high resolution. No large overall structural change was found, with most changes localized around the sites of mutation. Rearrangements were observed in the packing of side-chains in the major hydrophobic core, although none of the mutations was in the core. It is surprising that detailed structural analysis showed that packing had improved, with the volume of the mutant protein's hydrophobic cores decreasing as protein stability increased. Further, the number of van der Waals interactions in the entire protein showed an experimentally significant increase correlated with increasing stability. These results indicate that optimization of packing follows as a natural consequence of increased protein thermostability and that good packing is not necessarily the proximate cause of high stability. Another popular theory is that thermostable proteins have more electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions and these are responsible for the high stabilities. The mutants here show that increased numbers of electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions are not obligatory for large increases in protein stability.
15576031	Structural and functional properties of the human notch-1 ligand binding region.	We present NMR structural and dynamics analysis of the putative ligand binding region of human Notch-1, comprising EGF-like domains 11-13. Functional integrity of an unglycosylated, recombinant fragment was confirmed by calcium-dependent binding of tetrameric complexes to ligand-expressing cells. EGF modules 11 and 12 adopt a well-defined, rod-like orientation rigidified by calcium. The interdomain tilt is similar to that found in previously studied calcium binding EGF pairs, but the angle of twist is significantly different. This leads to an extended double-stranded beta sheet structure, spanning the two EGF modules. Based on the conservation of residues involved in interdomain hydrophobic packing, we propose this arrangement to be prototypical of a distinct class of EGF linkages. On this premise, we have constructed a model of the 36 EGF modules of the Notch extracellular domain that enables predictions to be made about the general role of calcium binding to this region.
3122831	Serine protease mechanism: structure of an inhibitory complex of alpha-lytic protease and a tightly bound peptide boronic acid.	The structure of the complex formed between alpha-lytic protease, a serine protease secreted by Lysobacter enzymogenes, and N-tert-butyloxycarbonylalanylprolylvaline boronic acid (Ki = 0.35 nM) has been studied by X-ray crystallography to a resolution of 2.0 A. The active-site serine forms a covalent, nearly tetrahedral adduct with the boronic acid moiety of the inhibitor. The complex is stabilized by seven hydrogen bonds between the enzyme and inhibitor with additional stabilization arising from van der Waals interactions between enzyme and inhibitor side chains and the burying of 330 A2 of hydrophobic surface area. Hydrogen bonding between Asp-102 and His-57 remains intact in the enzyme-inhibitor complex, and His N epsilon 2 is well positioned to donate its hydrogen to the leaving group. Little change in the positions of protease residues was observed on complex formation (root mean square main chain deviation = 0.13 A), suggesting that in its native state the enzyme is complementary to tetrahedral reaction intermediates or to the nearly tetrahedral transition state for the reaction.
14507721	NMR solution structure and topological orientation of monomeric phospholamban in dodecylphosphocholine micelles.	Phospholamban is an integral membrane protein that regulates the contractility of cardiac muscle by maintaining cardiomyocyte calcium homeostasis. Abnormalities in association of protein kinase A with PLB have recently been linked to human heart failure, where a single mutation is responsible for dilated cardiomyopathy. To date, a high-resolution structure of phospholamban in a lipid environment has been elusive. Here, we describe the first structure of recombinant, monomeric, biologically active phospholamban in lipid-mimicking dodecylphosphocholine micelles as determined by multidimensional NMR experiments. The overall structure of phospholamban is "L-shaped" with the hydrophobic domain approximately perpendicular to the cytoplasmic portion. This is in agreement with our previously published solid-state NMR data. In addition, there are two striking discrepancies between our structure and those reported previously for synthetic phospholamban in organic solvents: a), in our structure, the orientation of the cytoplasmic helix is consistent with the amphipathic nature of these residues; and b), within the hydrophobic helix, residues are positioned on two discrete faces of the helix as consistent with their functional roles ascribed by mutagenesis. This topology renders the two phosphorylation sites, Ser-16 and Thr-17, more accessible to kinases.
10571059	The X-ray crystal structure of beta-ketoacyl [acyl carrier protein] synthase I.	The crystal structure of the fatty acid elongating enzyme beta-ketoacyl [acyl carrier protein] synthase I (KAS I) from Escherichia coli has been determined to 2.3 A resolution by molecular replacement using the recently solved crystal structure of KAS II as a search model. The crystal contains two independent dimers in the asymmetric unit. KAS I assumes the thiolase alpha(beta)alpha(beta)alpha fold. Electrostatic potential distribution reveals an acyl carrier protein docking site and a presumed substrate binding pocket was detected extending the active site.

12651121	HIV-1 protease variants from 100-fold drug resistant clinical isolates: expression, purification, and crystallization.	High-resolution X-ray crystallographic structures of HIV-1 protease clinical variants complexed with licensed inhibitors are essential to understanding the fundamental cause of protease drug resistance. There is a need for structures of naturally evolved HIV-1 proteases from patients failing antiretroviral therapy. Here, we report the expression, purification, and crystallization of clinical isolates of HIV-1 protease that have been characterized to be more than 100 times less susceptible to US FDA approved protease inhibitors.
11527705	Evolution of anti-HIV drug candidates. Part 3: Diarylpyrimidine (DAPY) analogues.	The synthesis and anti-HIV-1 activity of a series of diarylpyrimidines (DAPYs) are described. Several members of this novel class of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are extremely potent against both wild-type and a panel of clinically significant single- and double-mutant strains of HIV-1.
16281058	Structural basis for UTP specificity of RNA editing TUTases from Trypanosoma brucei.	Trypanosomatids are pathogenic protozoa that undergo a unique form of post-transcriptional RNA editing that inserts or deletes uridine nucleotides in many mitochondrial pre-mRNAs. Editing is catalyzed by a large multiprotein complex, the editosome. A key editosome enzyme, RNA editing terminal uridylyl transferase 2 (TUTase 2; RET2) catalyzes the uridylate addition reaction. Here, we report the 1.8 A crystal structure of the Trypanosoma brucei RET2 apoenzyme and its complexes with uridine nucleotides. This structure reveals that the specificity of the TUTase for UTP is determined by a crucial water molecule that is exquisitely positioned by the conserved carboxylates D421 and E424 to sense a hydrogen atom on the N3 position of the uridine base. The three-domain structure also unveils a unique domain arrangement not seen before in the nucleotidyltansferase superfamily, with a large domain insertion between the catalytic aspartates. This insertion is present in all trypanosomatid TUTases. We also show that TbRET2 is essential for survival of the bloodstream form of the parasite and therefore is a potential target for drug therapy.
9546396	The unusual active site of Gal6/bleomycin hydrolase can act as a carboxypeptidase, aminopeptidase, and peptide ligase.	The Gal6 protease is in a class of cysteine peptidases identified by their ability to inactivate the anti-cancer drug bleomycin. The protein forms a barrel structure with the active sites embedded in a channel as in the proteasome. In Gal6 the C termini lie in the active site clefts. We show that Gal6 acts as a carboxypeptidase on its C terminus to convert itself to an aminopeptidase and peptide ligase. The substrate specificity of the peptidase activity is determined by the position of the C terminus of Gal6 rather than the sequence of the substrate. We propose a model to explain these diverse activities and Gal6's singular ability to inactivate bleomycin.
12044159	Interhelical interactions in the gp41 core: implications for activation of HIV-1 membrane fusion.	The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein complex (gp120-gp41) promotes viral entry by mediating the fusion of viral and cellular membranes. Formation of a stable trimer-of-hairpins structure in the gp41 ectodomain brings the two membranes into proximity, leading to membrane fusion. The core of this hairpin structure is a six-helix bundle in which three carboxyl-terminal outer helices pack against an inner trimeric coiled coil. Here we investigate the role of these conserved interhelical interactions on the structure and function of both the envelope glycoprotein and the gp41 core. We have replaced each of the eight amino acids at the buried face of the carboxyl-terminal helix with a representative amino acid, alanine. Structural and physicochemical characterization of the alanine mutants shows that hydrophobic interactions are a dominant factor in the stabilization of the six-helix bundle. Alanine substitutions at the Trp628, Trp631, Ile635, and Ile642 residues also affected envelope processing and/or gp120-gp41 association and abrogated the ability of the envelope glycoprotein to mediate cell-cell fusion. These results suggest that the amino-terminal region of the gp41 outer-layer alpha-helix plays a key role in the sequence of events associated with HIV-1 entry and have implications for the development of antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors of this conserved element.
11382747	Crystal structure of mannanase 26A from Pseudomonas cellulosa and analysis of residues involved in substrate binding.	The crystal structure of Pseudomonas cellulosa mannanase 26A has been solved by multiple isomorphous replacement and refined at 1.85 A resolution to an R-factor of 0.182 (R-free = 0.211). The enzyme comprises (beta/alpha)(8)-barrel architecture with two catalytic glutamates at the ends of beta-strands 4 and 7 in precisely the same location as the corresponding glutamates in other 4/7-superfamily glycoside hydrolase enzymes (clan GH-A glycoside hydrolases). The family 26 glycoside hydrolases are therefore members of clan GH-A. Functional analyses of mannanase 26A, informed by the crystal structure of the enzyme, provided important insights into the role of residues close to the catalytic glutamates. These data showed that Trp-360 played a critical role in binding substrate at the -1 subsite, whereas Tyr-285 was important to the function of the nucleophile catalyst. His-211 in mannanase 26A does not have the same function as the equivalent asparagine in the other GH-A enzymes. The data also suggest that Trp-217 and Trp-162 are important for the activity of mannanase 26A against mannooligosaccharides but are less important for activity against polysaccharides.
6876163	Comparison of the three-dimensional protein and nucleotide structure of the FAD-binding domain of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase with the FAD- as well as NADPH-binding domains of glutathione reductase.	The chain fold of the FAD-binding domain of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase resembles the chain folds of the two nucleotide-binding domains of glutathione reductase. This fold consists of a four-stranded parallel beta-sheet sandwiched between a three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet and alpha-helices. The nucleotides bind in similar positions relative to this chain fold. The best superposition of the folds has been established and geometrically quantified, giving rise to an equivalencing scheme for 110 residue positions, of which only four residues are identical in all three domains. It is discussed whether this chain fold is also present in a number of other FAD-binding proteins with known sequence. After the second strand of the parallel beta-sheet both FAD-binding domains contain long chain excursions, which make intimate contacts to rather distant parts of the respective molecules. In the environment of the isoalloxazine rings we observe interesting similarities. In both enzymes the si-face of this ring is covered by polypeptide, and only the re-face is accessible for the cofactor NADPH. Furthermore, there is a long alpha-helix in each enzyme, which points with its N-terminal start to the O-2 alpha region of isoalloxazine. These helices are spatially in the same position with respect to the isoalloxazine ring but are at quite different positions along the polypeptide chain. Since they can stabilize a negative charge around O-2 alpha, they may be important for the catalytic processes.
9578477	Lys42 and Ser42 variants of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase from Pseudomonas fluorescens reveal that Arg42 is essential for NADPH binding.	The conserved Arg42 of the flavoprotein p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase is located at the entrance of the active site in a loop between helix H2 and sheet E1 of the FAD-binding domain. Replacement of Arg42 by Lys or Ser decreases the turnover rate of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase from Pseudomonas fluorescens by more than two orders of magnitude. Rapid reaction kinetics show that the low activity of the Arg42 variants results from impaired binding of NADPH. In contrast to an earlier conclusion drawn for p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, substitution of Arg42 with Ser42 in the enzyme from P. fluorescens hardly disturbs the binding of FAD. Crystals of [Lys42]p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase complexed with 4-hydroxybenzoate diffract to 0.22-nm resolution. The structure of the Lys42 variant is virtually indistinguishable from the native enzyme with the flavin ring occupying the interior position within the active site. Lys42 in the mutant structure interacts indirectly via a solvent molecule with the 3-OH of the adenosine ribose moiety of FAD. Substrate perturbation difference spectra suggest that the Arg42 replacements influence the solvent accessibility of the flavin ring in the oxidized enzyme. In spite of this, the Arg42 variants fully couple enzyme reduction to substrate hydroxylation. Sequence-comparison studies suggest that Arg42 is involved in binding of the 2'-phosphoadenosine moiety of NADPH.
15247245	Crystal structure of the endonuclease domain encoded by the telomere-specific long interspersed nuclear element, TRAS1.	The telomere-specific long interspersed nuclear element, TRAS1, encodes an endonuclease domain, TRAS1-EN, which specifically cleaves the telomeric repeat targets (TTAGG)n of insects and (TTAGGG)n of vertebrates. To elucidate the sequence-specific recognition properties of TRAS1-EN, we determined the crystal structure at 2.4-A resolution. TRAS1-EN has a four-layered alpha/beta sandwich structure; its topology is similar to apurinic/apyrimidinic endonucleases, but the beta-hairpin (beta10-beta11) at the edge of the DNA-binding surface makes an extra loop that distinguishes TRAS1-EN from cellular apurinic/apyrimidinic endonucleases. A protein-DNA complex model suggests that the beta10-beta11 hairpin fits into the minor groove, enabling interaction with the telomeric repeats. Mutational studies of TRAS1-EN also indicated that the Asp-130 and beta10-beta11 hairpin structure are involved in specific recognition of telomeric repeats.
12206666	Crystallographic investigation of the role of aspartate 95 in the modulation of the redox potentials of Desulfovibrio vulgaris flavodoxin.	The side chain of aspartate 95 in flavodoxin from Desulfovibrio vulgaris provides the closest negative charge to N(1) of the bound FMN in the protein. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to substitute alanine, asparagine, or glutamate for this amino acid to assess the effect of this charge on the semiquinone/hydroquinone redox potential (E(1)) of the FMN cofactor. The D95A mutation shifts the E(1) redox potential positively by 16 mV, while a negative shift of 23 mV occurs in the oxidized/semiquinone midpoint redox potential (E(2)). The crystal structures of the oxidized and semiquinone forms of this mutant are similar to the corresponding states of the wild-type protein. In contrast to the wild-type protein, a further change in structure occurs in the D95A mutant in the hydroquinone form. The side chain of Y98 flips into an energetically more favorable edge-to-face interaction with the bound FMN. Analysis of the structural changes in the D95A mutant, taking into account electrostatic interactions at the FMN binding site, suggests that the pi-pi electrostatic repulsions have only a minor contribution to the very low E(1) redox potential of the FMN cofactor when bound to apoflavodoxin. Substitution of D95 with glutamate causes only a slight perturbation of the two one-electron redox potentials of the FMN cofactor. The structure of the D95E mutant reveals a large movement of the 60-loop (residues 60-64) away from the flavin in the oxidized structure. Reduction of this mutant to the hydroquinone causes the conformation of the 60-loop to revert back to that occurring in the structures of the wild-type protein. The crystal structures of the D95E mutant imply that electrostatic repulsion between a carboxylate on the side chain at position 95 and the phenol ring of Y98 prevents rotation of the Y98 side chain to a more energetically favorable conformation as occurs in the D95A mutant. Replacement of D95 with asparagine has no effect on E(2) but causes E(1) to change by 45 mV. The D95N mutant failed to crystallize. The K(d) values of the protein FMN complex in all three oxidation-reduction states differ from those of the wild-type complexes. Molecular modeling showed that the conformational energy of the protein changes with the redox state, in qualitative agreement with the observed changes in K(d), and allowed the electrostatic interactions between the FMN and the surrounding groups on the protein to be quantified.
11327835	Structural and kinetic analysis of the chemical rescue of the proton transfer function of carbonic anhydrase II.	Histidine 64 in human carbonic anhydrase II (HCA II) functions in the catalytic pathway of CO(2) hydration as a shuttle to transfer protons between the zinc-bound water and bulk water. Catalysis of the exchange of (18)O between CO(2) and water, measured by mass spectrometry, is dependent on this proton transfer and was decreased more than 10-fold for H64A HCA II compared with wild-type HCA II. The loss of catalytic activity of H64A HCA II could be rescued by 4-methylimidazole (4-MI), an exogenous proton donor, in a saturable process with a maximum activity of 40% of wild-type HCA II. The crystal structure of the rescued complex at 1.6 A resolution shows 4-MI bound in the active-site cavity of H64A HCA II, through pi stacking interactions with Trp 5 and H-bonding interactions with water molecules. In this location, 4-MI is about 12 A from the zinc and approximates the observed "out" position of His 64 in the structure of the wild-type enzyme. 4-MI appears to compensate for the absence of His 64 and rescues the catalytic activity of the H64A HCA II mutant. This result strongly suggests that the out conformation of His 64 is effective in the transfer of protons between the zinc-bound solvent molecule and solution.
807574	Crystallization and preliminary x-ray investigation of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase from Pseudomonas fluorescens.	P-Hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.2) can be crystallized from 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 39% saturated ammonium sulfate, and 1mM p-hydroxybenzoate. The space group is C2221 with 8 molecules/unit cell. When p-hydroxybenzoate is removed, the diffraction pattern and the cell dimensions change.
9865957	Probing the ligand binding domain of the GluR2 receptor by proteolysis and deletion mutagenesis defines domain boundaries and yields a crystallizable construct.	Ionotropic glutamate receptors constitute an important family of ligand-gated ion channels for which there is little biochemical or structural data. Here we probe the domain structure and boundaries of the ligand binding domain of the AMPA-sensitive GluR2 receptor by limited proteolysis and deletion mutagenesis. To identify the proteolytic fragments, Maldi mass spectrometry and N-terminal amino acid sequencing were employed. Trypsin digestion of HS1S2 (Chen GQ, Gouaux E. 1997. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 94:13431-13436) in the presence and absence of glutamate showed that the ligand stabilized the S1 and S2 fragments against complete digestion. Using limited proteolysis and multiple sequence alignments of glutamate receptors as guides, nine constructs were made, folded, and screened for ligand binding activity. From this screen, the S1S21 construct proved to be trypsin- and chymotrypsin-resistant, stable to storage at 4 degrees C, and amenable to three-dimensional crystal formation. The HS1S21 variant was readily prepared on a large scale, the His tag was easily removed by trypsin, and crystals were produced that diffracted to beyond 1.5 A resolution. These experiments, for the first time, pave the way to economical overproduction of the ligand binding domains of glutamate receptors and more accurately map the boundaries of the ligand binding domain.
15296742	Snapshot of protein structure evolution reveals conservation of functional dimerization through intertwined folding.	Protein-protein interactions govern a wide range of cellular processes. Molecular recognition responsible for homodimerization and heterodimerization in the rel/NF-kappaB family of eukaryotic transcription factors relies on a small cluster of hydrophobic residues. We have carried out a structural analysis of six NF-kappaB p50 dimer interface mutants; one of them revealed a remarkable alteration. One or possibly both its mutations cause a switch into an intertwined dimer, in which the molecular partners exchange nearly half of their fold. In spite of the extensive swapping of secondary structure elements, the topology within each counterpart is preserved, with a very similar overall structure and minimal changes at the interface. Thus intertwining rescues structure and function from a destabilizing mutation. Since the mutants originate from a directed evolution experiment and are functional, the data provide an evolutionary snapshot of how a protein structure can respond to mutations while maintaining a functional molecular architecture.
1374166	Structure of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase/DNA complex at 7 A resolution showing active site locations.	AIDS, caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is one of the world's most serious health problems, with current protocols being inadequate for either prevention or successful long-term treatment. In retroviruses such as HIV, the enzyme reverse transcriptase copies the single-stranded RNA genome into double-stranded DNA that is then integrated into the chromosomes of infected cells. Reverse transcriptase is the target of the most widely used treatments for AIDS, 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) and 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI), but resistant strains of HIV-1 arise in patients after a relatively short time. There are several nonnucleoside inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, but resistance to such agents also develops rapidly. We report here the structure at 7 A resolution of a ternary complex of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase heterodimer, a monoclonal antibody Fab fragment, and a duplex DNA template-primer. The double-stranded DNA binds in a groove on the surface of the enzyme. The electron density near one end of the DNA matches well with the known structure of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase RNase H domain. At the opposite end of the DNA, a mercurated derivative of UTP has been localized by difference Fourier methods, allowing tentative identification of the polymerase nucleoside triphosphate binding site. We also determined the structure of the reverse transcriptase/Fab complex in the absence of template-primer to compare the bound and free forms of the enzyme. The presence of DNA correlates with movement of protein electron density in the vicinity of the putative template-primer binding groove. These results have important implications for developing improved inhibitors of reverse transcriptase for the treatment of AIDS.
15182367	Human salivary alpha-amylase Trp58 situated at subsite -2 is critical for enzyme activity.	The nonreducing end of the substrate-binding site of human salivary alpha-amylase contains two residues Trp58 and Trp59, which belong to beta2-alpha2 loop of the catalytic (beta/alpha)(8) barrel. While Trp59 stacks onto the substrate, the exact role of Trp58 is unknown. To investigate its role in enzyme activity the residue Trp58 was mutated to Ala, Leu or Tyr. Kinetic analysis of the wild-type and mutant enzymes was carried out with starch and oligosaccharides as substrates. All three mutants exhibited a reduction in specific activity (150-180-fold lower than the wild type) with starch as substrate. With oligosaccharides as substrates, a reduction in k(cat), an increase in K(m) and distinct differences in the cleavage pattern were observed for the mutants W58A and W58L compared with the wild type. Glucose was the smallest product generated by these two mutants in the hydrolysis oligosaccharides; in contrast, wild-type enzyme generated maltose as the smallest product. The production of glucose by W58L was confirmed from both reducing and nonreducing ends of CNP-labeled oligosaccharide substrates. The mutant W58L exhibited lower binding affinity at subsites -2, -3 and +2 and showed an increase in transglycosylation activity compared with the wild type. The lowered affinity at subsites -2 and -3 due to the mutation was also inferred from the electron density at these subsites in the structure of W58A in complex with acarbose-derived pseudooligosaccharide. Collectively, these results suggest that the residue Trp58 plays a critical role in substrate binding and hydrolytic activity of human salivary alpha-amylase.
3403560	Multiple genes provide the basis for antifreeze protein diversity and dosage in the ocean pout, Macrozoarces americanus.	The ocean pout (Macrozoarces americanus) produces a set of antifreeze proteins that depresses the freezing point of its blood by binding to, and inhibiting the growth of, ice crystals. The amino acid sequences of all the major components of the ocean pout antifreeze proteins, including the immunologically distinct QAE component, have been derived by Edman degradation. In addition, sequences of several minor components were deduced from DNA sequencing of cDNA and genomic clones. Fifty percent of the amino acids are perfectly conserved in all these proteins as well as in two homologous sequences from the distantly related wolffish. Several of the conserved residues are threonines and asparagines, amino acids that have been implicated in ice binding in the structurally unrelated antifreeze protein of the righteye flounders. Aside from minor differences in post-translational modifications, heterogeneity in antifreeze protein components stems from amino acid differences encoded by multiple genes. Based on genomic Southern blots and library cloning statistics there are 150 copies of the 0.7-kilobase-long antifreeze protein gene in the Newfoundland ocean pout, the majority of which are closely linked but irregularly spaced. A more southerly population of ocean pout from New Brunswick in which the circulating antifreeze protein levels are considerably lower has approximately one-quater as many antifreeze protein genes. Thus, there appears to be a correlation between gene dosage and antifreeze protein levels, and hence the ability to survive in ice-laden seawater. Southern blot comparison of the two populations indicates that the differences in gene dosage were not generated by a simple set of deletions/duplications. They are more likely to be the result of differential amplification.
8107143	Nucleotide sequence and X-ray structure of cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase from Bacillus circulans strain 251 in a maltose-dependent crystal form.	The cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase, EC 2.4.1.19) gene from Bacillus circulans strain 251 was cloned and sequenced. It was found to code for a mature protein of 686 amino acid residues, showing 75% identity to the CGTase from B. circulans strain 8. The X-ray structure of the CGTase was elucidated in a maltodextrin-dependent crystal form and refined against X-ray diffraction data to 2.0 A resolution. The structure of the enzyme is nearly identical to the CGTase from B. circulans strain 8. Three maltose binding sites are observed at the protein surface, two in domain E and one in domain C. The maltose-dependence of CGTase crystallization can be ascribed to the proximity of two of the maltose binding sites to intermolecular crystal contacts. The maltose molecules bound in the E domain interact with several residues implicated in a raw starch binding motif conserved among a diverse group of starch converting enzymes.
12456667	Structures of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase with pre- and post-translocation AZTMP-terminated DNA.	AZT (3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine) resistance involves the enhanced excision of AZTMP from the end of the primer strand by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. This reaction can occur when an AZTMP-terminated primer is bound at the nucleotide-binding site (pre-translocation complex N) but not at the 'priming' site (post-translocation complex P). We determined the crystal structures of N and P complexes at 3.0 and 3.1 A resolution. These structures provide insight into the structural basis of AZTMP excision and the mechanism of translocation. Docking of a dNTP in the P complex structure suggests steric crowding in forming a stable ternary complex that should increase the relative amount of the N complex, which is the substrate for excision. Structural differences between complexes N and P suggest that the conserved YMDD loop is involved in translocation, acting as a springboard that helps to propel the primer terminus from the N to the P site after dNMP incorporation.
12925786	Structural studies of hydrogen bonds in the high-affinity streptavidin-biotin complex: mutations of amino acids interacting with the ureido oxygen of biotin.	An elaborate hydrogen-bonding network contributes to the tight binding of biotin to streptavidin. The specific energetic contributions of hydrogen bonds to the biotin ureido oxygen have previously been investigated by mapping the equilibrium and activation thermodynamic signatures of N23A, N23E, S27A, Y43A and Y43F site-directed mutants [Klumb et al. (1998), Biochemistry, 37, 7657-7663]. The crystal structures of these variants in the unbound and biotin-bound states provide structural insight into the energetic alterations and are described here. High (1.5-2.2 A) to atomic resolution (1.14 A) structures were obtained and structural models were refined to R values ranging from 0.12 to 0.20. The overall folding of streptavidin as described previously has not changed in any of the mutant structures. Major deviations such as side-chain shifts of residues in the binding site are observed only for the N23A and Y43A mutations. In none of the mutants is a systematic shift of biotin observed when one of the hydrogen-bonding partners to the ureido oxygen of biotin is removed. Recent thermodynamic studies report increases of DeltaDeltaG(o) of 5.0-14.6 kJ mol(-1) for these mutants with respect to the wild-type protein. The decreasing stabilities of the complexes of the mutants are discussed in terms of their structures.

10681546	Phenylethylthiazolylthiourea (PETT) non-nucleoside inhibitors of HIV-1 and HIV-2 reverse transcriptases. Structural and biochemical analyses.	Most non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors are specific for HIV-1 RT and demonstrate minimal inhibition of HIV-2 RT. However, we report that members of the phenylethylthiazolylthiourea (PETT) series of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors showing high potency against HIV-1 RT have varying abilities to inhibit HIV-2 RT. Thus, PETT-1 inhibits HIV-1 RT with an IC(50) of 6 nM but shows only weak inhibition of HIV-2 RT, whereas PETT-2 retains similar potency against HIV-1 RT (IC(50) of 5 nM) and also inhibits HIV-2 RT (IC(50) of 2.2 microM). X-ray crystallographic structure determinations of PETT-1 and PETT-2 in complexes with HIV-1 RT reveal the compounds bind in an overall similar conformation albeit with some differences in their interactions with the protein. To investigate whether PETT-2 could be acting at a different site on HIV-2 RT (e.g. the dNTP or template primer binding site), we compared modes of inhibition for PETT-2 against HIV-1 and HIV-2 RT. PETT-2 was a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to the dGTP substrate for both HIV-1 and HIV-2 RTs. PETT-2 was also a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to a poly(rC).(dG) template primer for HIV-2 RT. These results are consistent with PETT-2 binding in corresponding pockets in both HIV-1 and HIV-2 RT with amino acid sequence differences in HIV-2 RT affecting the binding of PETT-2 compared with PETT-1.
8986758	Kinetic and structural analysis of mutant CD4 receptors that are defective in HIV gp120 binding.	The T-cell antigen coreceptor CD4 also serves as the receptor for the envelope glycoprotein gp120 of HIV. Extensive mutational analysis of CD4 has implicated residues from a portion of the extracellular amino-terminal domain (D1) in gp120 binding. However, none of these proteins has been fully characterized biophysically, and thus the precise effects on molecular structure and binding interactions are unknown. In the present study, we produced soluble versions of three mutant CD4 molecules (F43V, G47S, and A55F) and characterized their structural properties, thermostability, and ability to bind gp120. Crystallographic and thermodynamic analysis showed minimal structural alterations in the F43V and G47S mutant proteins, which have solvent-exposed mutant side chains. In contrast, some degree of disorder appears to exist in the folded state of A55F, as a result of mutating a buried side chain. Real time kinetic measurements of the interaction of the mutant proteins with gp120 showed affinity decreases of 5-fold for G47S, 50-fold for A55F, and 200-fold for F43V. Although both rate constants for the binding reaction were affected by these mutations, the loss in affinity was mainly due to a decrease in on rates, with less drastic changes occurring in the off rates. These observations suggest the involvement of conformational adaptation in the CD4-gp120 interaction. Together, the structural and kinetic data confirm that F43V is a critical residue in gp120 recognition site, which may also include main chain interactions at residue Gly-47.
1610820	Contributions of the polar, uncharged amino acids to the stability of staphylococcal nuclease: evidence for mutational effects on the free energy of the denatured state.	In order to quantitate the contributions of the polar, uncharged amino acids to the stability of the native state of staphylococcal nuclease, each of the 13 alanines, 9 glycines, 9 threonines, 6 prolines, 6 glutamines, 6 asparagines, and 3 serines was substituted, either with both alanine and glycine or with 1 of these 2 amino acids plus valine. For each mutant, the stability to reversible denaturation (delta GH2O) was quantitated by determining the Kapp for this reaction as a function of guanidine hydrochloride concentration. In addition, the parameter mGuHCl (= d(delta G)/d[GuHCl]) was calculated from the data. To identify the local structural features responsible for the relatively large and variable changes in delta GH2O and mGuHCl observed for the same type of substitution at different locations in nuclease, statistical correlations were sought between delta GH2O, mGuHCl, and a number of descriptors of the local structure. As with substitutions of the large hydrophobic amino acids [Shortle, D., Stites, W. E., & Meeker, A. K. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 8033-8041], mutation of polar, uncharged residues to Gly leads to a change in stability that, on average, correlates well with the degree to which the wild-type residue is buried. This correlation is especially significant for threonine, an amino acid with both polar and hydrophobic character, but is not demonstrated for the more typically hydrophobic residue alanine. As reported in the previous study of alanine/glycine substitutions of hydrophobic residues, a significant correlation between changes in stability and changes in the value of mGuHCl is again observed, strengthening the conclusion that the putative structural changes in the denatured state which lead to increases or decreases in mGuHCl are responsible for a significant fraction of the stability loss for an average mutant. The existence of this correlation is consistent with the denatured state of wild-type staphylococcal nuclease having evolved to a relatively high free energy via optimization of a balance between a maximal exposure of hydrophobic surface and a minimal gain in chain entropy. On average, mutations are less stable in proportion to the extent of which they perturb this balance. A new and puzzling correlation is reported between the extent of buriedness of a residue in the wild-type native state versus the difference in mGuHCl between the Ala mutation and the Gly mutation at that position.
9654070	Kinetic mechanism of vanillyl-alcohol oxidase with short-chain 4-alkylphenols.	The kinetic mechanism of vanillyl-alcohol oxidase with 4-methylphenol, 4-ethylphenol, 4-propylphenol and their C alpha-deuterated analogs has been studied at pH 7.5 and 25 degrees C. Conversion of 4-methylphenol is extremely slow (0.005 s(-1)) while the enzyme is largely in the reduced form during turnover. 4-Ethylphenol and 4-propylphenol are readily converted while the enzyme is mainly in the oxidized form during turnover. The deuterium kinetic isotope effect for overall catalysis ranges between 7-10 whereas the intrinsic deuterium kinetic isotope effect for flavin reduction ranges over 9-10. With all three 4-alkylphenols, flavin reduction appeared to be a reversible process with the rate of reduction being in the same range as the rate for the reverse reaction. During the reductive half-reaction of vanillyl-alcohol oxidase with 4-ethylphenol and 4-propylphenol, a transient intermediate is formed with an absorbance maximum at 330 nm. This intermediate has been tentatively identified as the p-quinone methide of the aromatic substrate in complex with reduced enzyme. It is concluded that vanillyl-alcohol oxidase catalysis with 4-ethylphenol and 4-propylphenol favors an ordered sequential binding mechanism in which the rate of flavin reduction determines the turnover rate while the reduced enzyme-p-quinone methide binary complex rapidly reacts with dioxygen. During the reaction of vanillyl-alcohol oxidase with 4-methylphenol, a fluorescent enzyme species is stabilized. Based on its spectal characteristics and crystallographic data [Mattevi, A., Fraaije, M. W., Mozzarelli, A., Olivi, L., Coda, A. & van Berkel, W. J. H. (1997) Structure 5, 907-920], it is proposed that this species represents a covalent 5-(4'-hydroxybenzyl)-FAD adduct. With 4-ethylphenol and 4-propylphenol, similar N5 flavin adducts may be formed but their rate of formation is too slow to be of catalytic relevance.
8986757	Chaperone activity and structure of monomeric polypeptide binding domains of GroEL.	The chaperonin GroEL is a large complex composed of 14 identical 57-kDa subunits that requires ATP and GroES for some of its activities. We find that a monomeric polypeptide corresponding to residues 191 to 345 has the activity of the tetradecamer both in facilitating the refolding of rhodanese and cyclophilin A in the absence of ATP and in catalyzing the unfolding of native barnase. Its crystal structure, solved at 2.5 A resolution, shows a well-ordered domain with the same fold as in intact GroEL. We have thus isolated the active site of the complex allosteric molecular chaperone, which functions as a "minichaperone." This has mechanistic implications: the presence of a central cavity in the GroEL complex is not essential for those representative activities in vitro, and neither are the allosteric properties. The function of the allosteric behavior on the binding of GroES and ATP must be to regulate the affinity of the protein for its various substrates in vivo, where the cavity may also be required for special functions.
7619809	Structural studies on the PH domains of Db1, Sos1, IRS-1, and beta ARK1 and their differential binding to G beta gamma subunits.	Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains are approximately 110 amino acid residues in length and are structurally conserved in a number of intracellular signaling proteins. A role for these domains has been postulated for beta ARK, which binds to G beta gamma subunits. We have quantified the binding of individual (His)6-tag PH domains of human Db1, human Sos1, rat IRS-1, human beta ARK, and human beta ARK with an extra 33-residue C-terminal extension (beta ARK + C) to G beta gamma subunits. Our in vitro binding studies show that all of the PH domains (apart from Sos1), bind G beta gamma subunits in a dose-dependent manner, but beta ARK + C binds 4 times as much G beta gamma at saturation as the others. The IRS-1 PH domain has a similar half-maximal concentration of G beta gamma binding (18 nM) to beta ARK + C (30 nM), suggesting that the IRS-1 PH domain has sufficient determinants for G beta gamma binding. The beta ARK PH domain alone has a half-maximal value of 45 nM but a drastically reduced extent of G beta gamma binding, suggesting that both the PH domain and the C-terminal 33 residues are necessary for maximal binding. Db1 has a half-maximum concentration of G beta gamma binding of 45 nM and a maximal extent of binding similar to that of beta ARK, but it is difficult to demonstrate saturable binding of G beta gamma to Sos1. Since it was previously predicted that the C-terminal PH domain of Pleckstrin [Tyers, M., et al. (1988) Nature 333, 470-473] contains a potential calcium binding site, we have tested the different PH domains for calcium binding. Only the PH domain of Db1 bound 45Ca2+ with a Kd of 10 microM. CD spectroscopy of the purified recombinant PH domains indicated that they are predominantly beta-sheet structures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
2819062	The coenzyme analogue adenosine 5-diphosphoribose displaces FAD in the active site of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase. An x-ray crystallographic investigation.	p-Hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (PHBH) is an NADPH-dependent enzyme. To locate the NADPH binding site, the enzyme was crystallized under anaerobic conditions in the presence of the substrate p-hydroxybenzoate, the coenzyme analogue adenosine 5-diphosphoribose (ADPR), and sodium dithionite. This yielded colorless crystals that were suitable for X-ray analysis. Diffraction data were collected up to 2.7-A resolution. A difference Fourier between data from these colorless crystals and data from yellow crystals of the enzyme-substrate complex showed that in the colorless crystals the flavin ring was absent. The adenosine 5'-diphosphate moiety, which is the common part between FAD and ADPR, was still present. After restrained least-squares refinement of the enzyme-substrate complex with the riboflavin omitted from the model, additional electron density appeared near the pyrophosphate, which indicated the presence of an ADPR molecule in the FAD binding site of PHBH. The complete ADPR molecule was fitted to the electron density, and subsequent least-squares refinement resulted in a final R factor of 16.8%. Replacement of bound FAD by ADPR was confirmed by equilibrium dialysis, where it was shown that ADPR can effectively remove FAD from the enzyme under mild conditions in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. The empty pocket left by the flavin ring is filled by solvent, leaving the architecture of the active site and the binding of the substrate largely unaffected.
11992127	The SAM domain of polyhomeotic forms a helical polymer.	The polycomb group (PcG) proteins are important in the maintenance of stable repression patterns during development. Several PcG members contain a protein protein interaction module called a SAM domain (also known as SPM, PNT and HLH). Here we report the high-resolution structure of the SAM domain of polyhomeotic (Ph). Ph-SAM forms a helical polymer structure, providing a likely mechanism for the extension of PcG complexes. The structure of the polymer resembles that formed by the SAM domain of another transcriptional repressor, TEL. The formation of these polymer structures by SAM domains in two divergent repressors suggests a conserved mode of repression involving a higher order chromatin structure.
2180938	Crystallization of recombinant rat cathepsin B.	A glycosylation-minus mutant of rat cathepsin B expressed in yeast has been purified and crystallized. X-ray diffraction data have been collected and molecular replacement for solving the structure is in progress. The space group for the recombinant rat cathepsin B was determined to be P2(1) with unit cell dimensions alpha = 62.2 A, b = 90.19 A, c = 47.07 A, and beta = 97.43 degrees. A unit cell contains 4 molecules and 2 molecules per asymmetric unit.
10748207	An open conformation of switch I revealed by the crystal structure of a Mg2+-free form of RHOA complexed with GDP. Implications for the GDP/GTP exchange mechanism.	Mg(2+) ions are essential for guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity and play key roles in guanine nucleotide binding and preserving the structural integrity of GTP-binding proteins. We determined the crystal structure of a small GTPase RHOA complexed with GDP in the absence of Mg(2+) at 2.0-A resolution. Elimination of a Mg(2+) ion induces significant conformational changes in the switch I region that opens up the nucleotide-binding site. Similar structural changes have been observed in the switch regions of Ha-Ras bound to its guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Sos. This RHOA-GDP structure reveals an important regulatory role for Mg(2+) and suggests that guanine nucleotide exchange factor may utilize this feature of switch I to produce an open conformation in GDP/GTP exchange.
2835768	Structural analysis of a series of antiviral agents complexed with human rhinovirus 14.	The binding to human rhinovirus 14 of a series of eight antiviral agents that inhibit picornaviral uncoating after entry into host cells has been characterized crystallographically. All of these bind into the same hydrophobic pocket within the viral protein VP1 beta-barrel structure, although the orientation and position of each compound within the pocket was found to differ. The compounds cause the protein shell to be less flexible, thereby inhibiting disassembly. Although the antiviral potency of these compounds varies by 120-fold, they all induce the same conformational changes on the virion. The interactions of these compounds with the viral capsid are consistent with their observed antiviral activities against human rhinovirus 14 drug-resistant mutants and other rhinovirus serotypes. Crystallographic studies of one of these mutants confirm the partial sequencing data and support the finding that this is a single mutation that occurs within the binding pocket.
16060669	Influence of the dimer interface on glutathione transferase structure and dynamics revealed by amide H/D exchange mass spectrometry.	Mammalian glutathione (GSH) transferases are dimeric proteins, many of which share a common hydrophobic interaction motif that is important for dimer stability. In the rGSTM1-1 enzyme this motif involves the side chain of F56, located on the 56 loop of the N-terminal domain, which is intercalated between the alpha4- and alpha5-helices of the C-terminal domain of the opposing subnuit. Disruption of the complementary interactions in this motif by mutation of F56 to serine, arginine, or glutamate is known to have deleterious effects on catalytic efficiency but remarkably different effects on the stability of the dimer [Hornby et al. (2002) Biochemistry 41, 14238-14247]. The structural basis for the behavior of the mutants by amide H/D exchange mass spectrometry is described. A substantial decrease in H/D exchange is observed in the GSH binding domain and in parts of the dimer interface upon substrate binding. The F56S and F56R mutants exhibit enhanced H/D exchange kinetics in the GSH binding domain and at the dimer interface. In contrast, the F56E mutant shows a decrease in the rate and extent of amide H/D exchange at the dimer interface and enhanced exchange kinetics in the GSH binding domain. The results suggest that the F56E mutant has a restructured dimer interface with decreased solvent accessibility and dynamics. Although all of the F56 mutations disrupt the GSH binding site, the effects of the mutations on the structure of the subunit interface and dimer stability are quite distinct.
9000632	Crystal structures of 8-Cl and 9-Cl TIBO complexed with wild-type HIV-1 RT and 8-Cl TIBO complexed with the Tyr181Cys HIV-1 RT drug-resistant mutant.	Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) is an important target for chemotherapeutic agents used in the treatment of AIDS; the TIBO compounds are potent non-nucleoside inhibitors of HIV-1 RT (NNRTIs). Crystal structures of HIV-1 RT complexed with 8-Cl TIBO (R86183, IC50 = 4.6 nM) and 9-Cl TIBO (R82913, IC50 = 33 nM) have been determined at 3.0 A resolution. Mutant HIV-1 RT, containing Cys in place of Tyr at position 181 (Tyrl81Cys), is highly resistant to many NNRTIs and HIV-1 variants containing this mutation have been selected in both cell culture and clinical trials. We also report the crystal structure of Tyrl81Cys HIV-1 RT in complex with 8-Cl TIBO (IC50 = 130 nM) determined at 3.2 A resolution. Averaging of the electron density maps computed for different HIV-1 RT/NNRTI complexes and from diffraction datasets obtained using a synchrotron source from frozen (-165 degrees C) and cooled (-10 degrees C) crystals of the same complex was employed to improve the quality of electron density maps and to reduce model bias. The overall locations and conformations of the bound inhibitors in the complexes containing wild-type HIV-1 RT and the two TIBO inhibitors are very similar, as are the overall shapes and volumes of the non-nucleoside inhibitor-binding pocket (NNIBP). The major differences between the two wild-type HIV-1 RT/TIBO complexes occur in the vicinity of the TIBO chlorine substituents and involve the polypeptide segments around the beta5-beta6 connecting loop (residues 95 to 105) and the beta13-beta14 hairpin (residues 235 and 236). In all known structures of HIV-1 RT/NNRTI complexes, including these two, the position of the beta12-beta13 hairpin or the "primer grip" is significantly displaced relative to the position in the structure of HIV-1 RT complexed with a double-stranded DNA and in unliganded HIV-1 RT structures. Since the primer grip helps to position the template-primer, this displacement suggests that binding of NNRTIs would affect the relative positions of the primer terminus and the polymerase active site. This could explain biochemical data showing that NNRTI binding to HIV-1 RT reduces efficiency of the chemical step of DNA polymerization, but does not prevent binding of either dNTPs or DNA. When the structure of the Tyr181Cys mutant HIV-1 RT in complex with 8-Cl TIBO is compared with the corresponding structure containing wild-type HIV-1 RT, the overall conformations of Tyr181Cys and wild-type HIV-1 RT and of the 8-Cl TIBO inhibitors are very similar. Some positional changes in the polypeptide backbone of the beta6-beta10-beta9 sheet containing residue 181 are observed when the Tyr181Cys and wild-type complexes are compared, particularlty near residue Val179 of beta9. In the p51 subunit, the Cys181 side-chain is oriented in a similar direction to the Tyr181 side-chain in the wild-type complex. However, the electron density corresponding to the sulfur of the Cys181 side-chain in the p66 subunit is very weak, indicating that the thiol group is disordered, presumably because there is no significant interaction with either 8-Cl TIBO or nearby amino acid residues. In the mutant complex, there are slight rearrangements of the side-chains of other amino acid residues in the NNIBP and of the flexible dimethylallyl group of 8-Cl TIBO; these conformational changes could potentially compensate for the interactions that were lost when the relatively large tyrosine at position 181 was replaced by a less bulky cysteine residue. In the corresponding wild-type complex, Tyr181 iin the p66 subunit has significant interactions with the bound inhibitor and the position of the Tyr181 side-chain is well defined in both subunits. Apparently the Tyr181 --> Cys mutation eliminates favorable contacts of the aromatic ring of the tyrosine and the bou
12379842	Core mutations switch monomeric protein GB1 into an intertwined tetramer.	The structure of a mutant immunoglobulin-binding B1 domain of streptococcal protein G (GB1), which comprises five conservative changes in hydrophobic core residues, was determined by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. The oligomeric state and quaternary structure of the mutant protein are drastically changed from the wild type protein. The mutant structure consists of a symmetric tetramer, with intermolecular strand exchange involving all four units. Four of the five secondary structure elements present in the monomeric wild type GB1 structure are retained in the tetrameric structure, although their intra- and intermolecular interactions are altered. Our results demonstrate that through the acquisition of a moderate number of pivotal point mutations, proteins such as GB1 are able to undergo drastic structural changes, overcoming reduced stability of the monomeric unit by multimerization. The present structure is an illustrative example of how proteins exploit the breadth of conformational space.
11254385	Structure and functionality of a designed p53 dimer.	P53 is a homotetrameric tumor suppressor protein involved in transcriptional control of genes that regulate cell proliferation and death. In order to probe the role that oligomerization plays in this capacity, we have previously designed and characterized a series of p53 proteins with altered oligomeric states through hydrophilc substitution of residues Met340 or Leu344 in the normally tetrameric oligomerization domain. Although such mutations have little effect on the overall secondary structural content of the oligomerization domain, both solubility and the resistance to thermal denaturation are substantially reduced relative to that of the wild-type domain. Here, we report the design and characterization of a double-mutant p53 with alterations of residues at positions Met340 and Leu344. The double-mutations Met340Glu/Leu344Lys and Met340Gln/Leu344Arg resulted in distinct dimeric forms of the protein. Furthermore, we have verified by NMR structure determination that the double-mutant Met340Gln/Leu344Arg is essentially a "half-tetramer". Analysis of the in vivo activities of full-length p53 oligomeric mutants reveals that while cell-cycle arrest requires tetrameric p53, transcriptional transactivation activity of monomers and dimers retain roughly background and half of the wild-type activity, respectively.
9398521	Contribution of water molecules in the interior of a protein to the conformational stability.	Water molecules frequently occur in the interior of globular proteins. To elucidate the contribution of buried water molecules to the conformational stability of a protein, we examined the crystal structures and the thermodynamic parameters of denaturation of six Ile to Ala/Gly mutant human lysozymes, in which a cavity is created at each mutation site by the substitution of a smaller side-chain for a larger one. One or two ordered water molecules were found in the cavities created in some mutants (I106A, I59A and I59G). The cavity volumes for these three mutants were bigger than those that remained empty in the other mutants. The stability of the mutant proteins with the newly introduced water molecules was about 8 kJ/mol higher than that expected from the change in hydrophobic surface area (DeltaDeltaASAHP) exposed upon denaturation. It was concluded that a water molecule in a cavity created in the interior of a protein contributes favorably to the stability.
12065401	Crystal structure of auxin-binding protein 1 in complex with auxin.	The structure of auxin-binding protein 1 (ABP1) from maize has been determined at 1.9 A resolution, revealing its auxin-binding site. The structure confirms that ABP1 belongs to the ancient and functionally diverse germin/seed storage 7S protein superfamily. The binding pocket of ABP1 is predominantly hydrophobic with a metal ion deep inside the pocket coordinated by three histidines and a glutamate. Auxin binds within this pocket, with its carboxylate binding the zinc and its aromatic ring binding hydrophobic residues including Trp151. There is a single disulfide between Cys2 and Cys155. No conformational rearrangement of ABP1 was observed when auxin bound to the protein in the crystal, but examination of the structure reveals a possible mechanism of signal transduction.
11054289	Structures of l-fuculose-1-phosphate aldolase mutants outlining motions during catalysis.	The crystal structures of l-fuculose-1-phosphate aldolase (FucA) with and without a ligated analogue of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and of a number of active center mutants have resulted in a model of the catalytic mechanism. This model has now been confirmed by structural analyses of further mutations at the zinc coordination sphere and at the phosphate site. In addition, these mutants have revealed new aspects of the catalysis: the hydroxyl group of Tyr113' (from a neighboring subunit), which sits just outside the zinc coordination sphere, steers DHAP towards a productive binding mode at the zinc ion; Glu73 contacts zinc in between the two ligand positions intended for the DHAP oxygen atoms and thus avoids blocking of these positions by a tetrahedrally coordinated hydroxy ion; the FucA polypeptide does not assume its minimum energy state but oscillates between two states of elevated energy as demonstrated by a mutant in a minimum energy state. The back and forth motion involves a mobile loop connecting the phosphate site with intersubunit motions and thus with the Brownian motion of the solvent. The phosphate group is bound strongly at a given distance to the zinc ion, which prevents the formation of too tight a DHAP:zinc complex. This observation explains our failure to find mutants that accept phosphate-free substitutes for DHAP. The FucA zinc coordination sphere is compared with that of carbonic anhydrase.
1992356	Solving the structure of human H ferritin by genetically engineering intermolecular crystal contacts.	Ferritin is important in iron homeostasis. Its twenty-four chains of two types, H and L, assemble as a hollow shell providing an iron-storage cavity. Ferritin molecules in cells containing high levels of iron tend to be rich in L chains, and may have a long-term storage function, whereas H-rich ferritins are more active in iron metabolism. The molecular basis for the greater activity of H-rich ferritins has until now been obscure, largely because the structure of H-chain ferritin has remained unknown owing to the difficulties in obtaining crystals ordered enough for X-ray crystallographic analysis. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of a human ferritin H-chain homopolymer. By genetically engineering a change in the sequence of the intermolecular contact region, we obtained crystals isomorphous with the homologous rat L ferritin and of high enough quality for X-ray diffraction analysis. The X-ray structure of human H ferritin shows a novel metal site embedded within each of its four-helix bundles and we suggest that ferroxidase activity associated with this site accounts for its rapid uptake of iron.
8072533	Crystal structure of an isoleucine-zipper trimer.	Subunit oligomerization in many proteins is mediated by short coiled-coil motifs. These motifs share a characteristic seven-amino-acid repeat containing hydrophobic residues at the first (a) and fourth (d) positions. Despite this common pattern, different sequences form two-, three- and four-stranded helical ropes. We have investigated the basis for oligomer choice by characterizing variants of the GCN4 leucine-zipper dimerization domain that adopt trimeric or tetrameric structures in response to mutations at the a and d positions. We now report the high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of an isoleucine-containing mutant that folds into a parallel three-stranded, alpha-helical coiled coil. In contrast to the dimer and tetramer structures, the interior packing of the trimer can accommodate beta-branched residues in the most preferred rotamer at both hydrophobic positions. Compatibility of the shape of the core amino acids with the distinct packing spaces in the two-, three- and four-stranded conformations appears to determine the oligomerization state of the GCN4 leucine-zipper variants.
11752789	Crystallization and preliminary crystallographic studies of five crystal forms of Escherichia coli L-asparaginase II (Asp90Glu mutant).	L-Asparaginase II from Escherichia coli with an Asp90Glu mutation in the active site has been crystallized in five polymorphic forms. Crystals of all polymorphs suitable for X-ray diffraction experiments were obtained by the vapour-diffusion method. Crystals of form I belong to the monoclinic system (space group C2), have unit-cell parameters a = 73.1, b = 133.1, c = 62.6 A, beta = 108.8 degrees and diffract to 2.27 A resolution. Three of the crystal forms are orthorhombic, with unit-cell parameters a = 225.4, b = 128.0, c = 62.6 A (form II, P2(1)2(1)2), a = 59.9, b = 71.2, c = 130.6 A (form III, primitive cell) and a = 73.8, b = 122.1, c = 124.2 A (form IV, P2(1)2(1)2(1) or P2(1)2(1)2); the crystals diffract to 2.33, 3.5 and 1.7 A, respectively. Polymorph V is trigonal, space group P3(1)21, with unit-cell parameters a = 123.1, c = 83.8 A; the crystals diffract to 2.65 A resolution.
15567410	Structural analysis of the group II intron splicing factor CRS2 yields insights into its protein and RNA interaction surfaces.	Chloroplast RNA splicing 2 (CRS2) is a nuclear-encoded protein required for the splicing of nine group II introns in maize chloroplasts. CRS2 functions in the context of splicing complexes that include one of two CRS2-associated factors (CAF1 and CAF2). The CRS2-CAF1 and CRS2-CAF2 complexes are required for the splicing of different subsets of CRS2-dependent introns, and they bind tightly and specifically to their genetically defined intron targets in vivo. The CRS2 amino acid sequence is closely related to those of bacterial peptidyl-tRNA hydrolases (PTHs). To identify the structural differences between CRS2 and bacterial PTHs responsible for CRS2's gains of CAF binding and intron splicing functions, we determined the structure of CRS2 by X-ray crystallography. The fold of CRS2 is the same as that of Escherichia coli PTH, but CRS2 has two surfaces that differ from the corresponding surfaces in PTH. One of these is more hydrophobic in CRS2 than in PTH. Site-directed mutagenesis of this surface blocked CRS2-CAF complex formation, indicating that it is the CAF binding site. The CRS2 surface corresponding to the putative tRNA binding face of PTH is considerably more basic than in PTH, suggesting that CRS2 interacts with group II intron substrates via this surface. Both the sequence and the structural context of the amino acid residues essential for peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase activity are conserved in CRS2, yet expression of CRS2 is incapable of rescuing a pth(ts)E.coli strain.
11927566	The large subunit of initiation factor aIF2 is a close structural homologue of elongation factors.	The heterotrimeric factor e/aIF2 plays a central role in eukaryotic/archaeal initiation of translation. By delivering the initiator methionyl-tRNA to the ribosome, e/aIF2 ensures specificity of initiation codon selection. The three subunits of aIF2 from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus abyssi could be overproduced in Escherichia coli. The beta and gamma subunits each contain a tightly bound zinc. The large gamma subunit is shown to form the structural core for trimer assembly. The crystal structures of aIF2gamma, free or complexed to GDP-Mg(2+) or GDPNP-Mg(2+), were resolved at resolutions better than 2 A. aIF2gamma displays marked similarities to elongation factors. A distinctive feature of e/aIF2gamma is a subdomain containing a zinc-binding knuckle. Examination of the nucleotide-complexed aIF2gamma structures suggests mechanisms of action and tRNA binding properties similar to those of an elongation factor. Implications for the mechanism of translation initiation in both eukarya and archaea are discussed. In particular, positioning of the initiator tRNA in the ribosomal A site during the search for the initiation codon is envisaged.
9837995	NMR solution structures of [d(GCGAAT-3'-3'-alphaT-5'-5'-CGC)2] and its unmodified control.	We present the high-resolution solution structures of a self-complementary DNA decamer duplex featuring a single alpha-anomeric nucleotide per strand encompassed by a set of 3'-3' and 5'-5' phosphodiester linkages, d(GCGAAT-3'-3'-alphaT-5'-5'-CGC)2, alphaT, and its unmodified control, d(GCGAATTCGC)2, obtained by restrained molecular dynamics. Interproton distance and deoxyribose ring torsion angle restraints were deduced from homonuclear NOESY and DQF-COSY data, respectively. For both the control and alphaT duplexes, excellent global convergence was observed from two different (A- and B-) starting models. The final average structures of the two duplexes are highly homologous, and overall possess the traits characteristic of right-handed B-DNA duplexes. However, localized differences between the two structures stem from the enhanced conformational exchange in the deoxyribose ring of the cytidine following the 5'-5' linkage, the C3'- exo pseudorotation phase angle of the alpha-nucleotide, and unusual backbone torsions in the 3'-3' and 5'-5' phosphodiester linkages. The structural data reported here are relevant to the design of antisense therapeutics comprised of these modifications.
10737931	Plasticity and steric strain in a parallel beta-helix: rational mutations in the P22 tailspike protein.	By means of genetic screens, a great number of mutations that affect the folding and stability of the tailspike protein from Salmonella phage P22 have been identified. Temperature-sensitive folding (tsf) mutations decrease folding yields at high temperature, but hardly affect thermal stability of the native trimeric structure when assembled at low temperature. Global suppressor (su) mutations mitigate this phenotype. Virtually all of these mutations are located in the central domain of tailspike, a large parallel beta-helix. We modified tailspike by rational single amino acid replacements at three sites in order to investigate the influence of mutations of two types: (1) mutations expected to cause a tsf phenotype by increasing the side-chain volume of a core residue, and (2) mutations in a similar structural context as two of the four known su mutations, which have been suggested to stabilize folding intermediates and the native structure by the release of backbone strain, an effect well known for residues that are primarily evolved for function and not for stability or folding of the protein. Analysis of folding yields, refolding kinetics and thermal denaturation kinetics in vitro show that the tsf phenotype can indeed be produced rationally by increasing the volume of side chains in the beta-helix core. The high-resolution crystal structure of mutant T326F proves that structural rearrangements only take place in the remarkably plastic lumen of the beta-helix, leaving the arrangement of the hydrogen-bonded backbone and thus the surface of the protein unaffected. This supports the notion that changes in the stability of an intermediate, in which the beta-helix domain is largely formed, are the essential mechanism by which tsf mutations affect tailspike folding. A rational design of su mutants, on the other hand, appears to be more difficult. The exchange of two residues in the active site expected to lead to a drastic release of steric strain neither enhanced the folding properties nor the stability of tailspike. Apparently, side-chain interactions in these cases overcompensate for backbone strain, illustrating the extreme optimization of the tailspike protein for conformational stability. The result exemplifies the view arising from the statistical analysis of the distribution of backbone dihedral angles in known three-dimensional protein structures that the adoption of straight phi/psi angles other than the most favorable ones is often caused by side-chain interactions. Proteins 2000;39:89-101.
15273307	Solution structure of the RWD domain of the mouse GCN2 protein.	GCN2 is the alpha-subunit of the only translation initiation factor (eIF2alpha) kinase that appears in all eukaryotes. Its function requires an interaction with GCN1 via the domain at its N-terminus, which is termed the RWD domain after three major RWD-containing proteins: RING finger-containing proteins, WD-repeat-containing proteins, and yeast DEAD (DEXD)-like helicases. In this study, we determined the solution structure of the mouse GCN2 RWD domain using NMR spectroscopy. The structure forms an alpha + beta sandwich fold consisting of two layers: a four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet, and three side-by-side alpha-helices, with an alphabetabetabetabetaalphaalpha topology. A characteristic YPXXXP motif, which always occurs in RWD domains, forms a stable loop including three consecutive beta-turns that overlap with each other by two residues (triple beta-turn). As putative binding sites with GCN1, a structure-based alignment allowed the identification of several surface residues in alpha-helix 3 that are characteristic of the GCN2 RWD domains. Despite the apparent absence of sequence similarity, the RWD structure significantly resembles that of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s), with most of the structural differences in the region connecting beta-strand 4 and alpha-helix 3. The structural architecture, including the triple beta-turn, is fundamentally common among various RWD domains and E2s, but most of the surface residues on the structure vary. Thus, it appears that the RWD domain is a novel structural domain for protein-binding that plays specific roles in individual RWD-containing proteins.
9811833	A streptavidin mutant with altered ligand-binding specificity.	The biotin-binding site of streptavidin was modified to alter its ligand-binding specificity. In natural streptavidin, the side chains of N23 and S27 make two of the three hydrogen bonds with the ureido oxygen of biotin. These two residues were mutated to severely weaken biotin binding while attempting to maintain the affinity for two biotin analogs, 2-iminobiotin and diaminobiotin. Redesigning of the biotin-binding site used the difference in local electrostatic charge distribution between biotin and these biotin analogs. Free energy calculations predicted that the introduction of a negative charge at the position of S27 plus the mutation N23A should disrupt two of the three hydrogen bonds between natural streptavidin and the ureido oxygen of biotin. In contrast, the imino hydrogen of 2-iminobiotin should form a hydrogen bond with the side chain of an acidic amino acid at position 27. This should reduce the biotin-binding affinity by approximately eight orders of magnitude, while leaving the affinities for these biotin analogs virtually unaffected. In good agreement with these predictions, a streptavidin mutant with the N23A and S27D substitutions binds 2-iminobiotin with an affinity (Ka) of 1 x 10(6) M-1, two orders of magnitude higher than that for biotin (1 x 10(4) M-1). In contrast, the binding affinity of this streptavidin mutant for diaminobiotin (2.7 x 10(4) M-1) was lower than predicted (2.9 x 10(5) M-1), suggesting the position of the diaminobiotin in the biotin-binding site was not accurately determined by modeling.
8355275	Refined X-ray structures of haloalkane dehalogenase at pH 6.2 and pH 8.2 and implications for the reaction mechanism.	The crystal structure of haloalkane dehalogenase from Xanthobacter autotrophicus GJ10 has been refined at 1.9 A resolution at two different pH values, the pH of crystallization (pH 6.2) and the pH of optimal activity (pH 8.2), to final R-factors of 16.8% and 16.4%, respectively. Both models show good stereochemical quality. Two non-glycine residues have main-chain torsion angles that are located outside the "allowed" regions in a Ramachandran plot. One of them is the nucleophilic residue Asp124, which, together with the two other active site residues His289 and Asp260, is situated in an internal, predominantly hydrophobic cavity. The other residue, Asn148, helps stabilize the conformations of two of these active-site residues, Asp124 and Asp260. Comparison of the models at pH 6.2 and pH 8.2 revealed one major structural difference. At pH 6.2, a salt-bridge is present between the N epsilon 2 atom of His289 and the O delta 1 atom of Asp124, while at pH 8.2, this salt-bridge is absent, indicating that the N epsilon 2 atom of the histidine residue is mostly deprotonated at the pH of optimum activity. This is in agreement with the putative reaction mechanism in which the O delta 1 atom of Asp124 performs a nucleophilic attack on the substrate, resulting in an intermediate ester. This ester is subsequently cleaved by a hydrolytic water molecule. The high-resolution data sets clearly show the exact position of this water molecule. It is in an ideal position for donating a proton to the N epsilon 2 atom of His289 and subsequently cleaving the covalently bound intermediate ester, releasing the alcohol product. Detailed investigation of both refined models showed a number of unusual structural features. Four out of 11 helices contain an internal proline residue other than in the first turn. Two other alpha-helices have adopted in their central part a 3(10) conformation. A novel four-residue turn between a helix and a strand, the alpha beta 4 turn, is located at the site of the bend in the central eight-stranded beta-sheet of the dehalogenase structure.
12962479	Structure and catalytic mechanism of L-rhamnulose-1-phosphate aldolase.	The structure of L-rhamnulose-1-phosphate aldolase has been established at 1.35 A resolution in a crystal form that was obtained by a surface mutation and has one subunit of the C(4)-symmetric tetramer in the asymmetric unit. It confirms an earlier 2.7 A resolution structure which was determined in a complicated crystal form with 20 subunits per asymmetric unit. The chain fold and the active center are similar to those of L-fuculose-1-phosphate aldolase and L-ribulose-5-phosphate 4-epimerase. The active center similarity is supported by a structural comparison of all three enzymes and by the binding mode of the inhibitor phosphoglycolohydroxamate at the site of the product dihydroxyacetone phosphate for the two aldolases. The sensitivity of the catalytic rate to several mutations and a comparison with the established mechanism of the related aldolase give rise to a putative catalytic mechanism. This mechanism involves the same binding mode of the second product L-lactaldehyde in both aldolases, except for a 180 degrees flip of the aldehyde group distinguishing between the two epimers rhamnulose and fuculose. The N-terminal domain exhibits a correlated anisotropic mobility that channels the isotropic Brownian motion into a directed movement of the catalytic base and the substrate phosphate on the N-domain toward the zinc ion and the lactaldehyde on the C-terminal domain. We suggest that this movement supports the catalysis mechanically.
11513591	Hydrophobic core manipulations in ribonuclease T1.	Differential scanning calorimetry, urea denaturation, and X-ray crystallography were combined to study the structural and energetic consequences of refilling an engineered cavity in the hydrophobic core of RNase T1 with CH(3), SH, and OH groups. Three valines that cluster together in the major hydrophobic core of T1 were each replaced with Ala, Ser, Thr, and Cys. Compared to the wild-type protein, all these mutants reduce the thermodynamic stability of the enzyme considerably. The relative order of stability at all three positions is as follows: Val > Ala approximately equal to Thr > Ser. The effect of introducing a sulfhydryl group is more variable. Surprisingly, a Val --> Cys mutation in a hydrophobic environment can be as or even more destabilizing than a Val --> Ser mutation. Furthermore, our results reveal that the penalty for introducing an OH group into a hydrophobic cavity is roughly the same as the gain obtained from filling the cavity with a CH(3) group. The inverse equivalence of the behavior of hydroxyl and methyl groups seems to be crucial for the unique three-dimensional structure of the proteins. The importance of negative design elements in this context is highlighted.
12499545	The refined atomic structure of carbonic anhydrase II at 1.05 A resolution: implications of chemical rescue of proton transfer.	Using synchrotron radiation and a CCD detector, X-ray data have been collected at 100 K for the His64Ala mutant of human carbonic anhydrase II complexed with 4-methylimidazole (4-MI) to a maximal 1.05 A resolution, allowing full anisotropic least-squares refinement. The refined model has a conventional R factor of 15.7% for all reflections. The C(alpha) coordinates of the model presented here have an r.m.s. deviation of 0.10 A relative to the previously determined structure at 1.6 A resolution. Several amino-acid residues (six of the 255 observed) have been identified with multiple rotamer side-chain conformations. C, N and O atoms can be differentiated with selective electron-density map contouring. The estimated standard deviations for all main-chain non-H atom bond lengths and angles are 0.013 and 0.030 A, respectively, based on unrestrained full-matrix least-squares refinement. This structure gives detailed information about the tetrahedrally arranged zinc ion coordinated by three histidine N atoms (His94 N(epsilon 2), His96 N(epsilon2) and His119 N(delta1)) and a water/hydroxide, the multiple binding sites of the proton chemical rescue molecule 4-MI and the solvent networks linking the zinc-bound water/hydroxide and 4-MI molecules. This structure presents the highest resolution structure of a carbonic anhydrase isozyme so far determined and adds to the understanding of proton-transfer processes.
16364919	The role of docking interactions in mediating signaling input, output, and discrimination in the yeast MAPK network.	Cells use a network of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) to coordinate responses to diverse extracellular signals. Here, we examine the role of docking interactions in determining connectivity of the yeast MAPKs Fus3 and Kss1. These closely related kinases are activated by the common upstream MAPK kinase Ste7 yet generate distinct output responses, mating and filamentous growth, respectively. We find that docking interactions are necessary for communication with the kinases and that they can encode subtle differences in pathway-specific input and output. The cell cycle arrest mediator Far1, a mating-specific substrate, has a docking motif that selectively binds Fus3. In contrast, the shared partner Ste7 has a promiscuous motif that binds both Fus3 and Kss1. Structural analysis reveals that Fus3 interacts with specific and promiscuous peptides in conformationally distinct modes. Induced fit recognition may allow docking peptides to achieve discrimination by exploiting subtle differences in kinase flexibility.
11856322	Engineering of a monomeric and low-glycosylated form of human butyrylcholinesterase: expression, purification, characterization and crystallization.	Human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE; EC 3.1.1.8) is of particular interest because it hydrolyzes or scavenges a wide range of toxic compounds including cocaine, organophosphorus pesticides and nerve agents. The relative contribution of each N-linked glycan for the solubility, the stability and the secretion of the enzyme was investigated. A recombinant monomeric BChE lacking four out of nine N-glycosylation sites and the C-terminal oligomerization domain was stably expressed as a monomer in CHO cells. The purified recombinant BChE showed catalytic properties similar to those of the native enzyme. Tetragonal crystals suitable for X-ray crystallography studies were obtained; they were improved by recrystallization and found to diffract to 2.0 A resolution using synchrotron radiation. The crystals belong to the tetragonal space group I422 with unit cell dimensions a = b = 154.7 A, c = 124.9 A, giving a Vm of 2.73 A3 per Da (estimated 60% solvent) for a single molecule of recombinant BChE in the asymmetric unit. The crystal structure of butyrylcholinesterase will help elucidate unsolved issues concerning cholinesterase mechanisms in general.
9041653	Importance of van der Waals contact between Glu 35 and Trp 109 to the catalytic action of human lysozyme.	The importance of van der Waals contact between Glu 35 and Trp 109 to the active-site structure and the catalytic properties of human lysozyme (HL) has been investigated by site-directed mutagenesis. The X-ray analysis of mutant HLs revealed that both the replacement of Glu 35 by Asp or Ala, and the replacement of Trp 109 by Phe or Ala resulted in a significant but localized change in the active-site cleft geometry. A prominent movement of the backbone structure was detected in the region of residues 110 to 120 and in the region of residues 100 to 115 for the mutations concerning Glu 35 and Trp 109, respectively. Accompanied by the displacement of the main-chain atoms with a maximal deviation of C alpha atom position ranging from 0.7 A to 1.0 A, the mutant HLs showed a remarkable change in the catalytic properties against Micrococcus luteus cell substrate as compared with native HL. Although the replacement of Glu 35 by Ala completely abolished the lytic activity, HL-Asp 35 mutant retained a weak but a certain lytic activity, showing the possible involvement of the side-chain carboxylate group of Asp 35 in the catalytic action. The kinetic consequence derived from the replacement of Trp 109 by Phe or Ala together with the result of the structural change suggested that the structural detail of the cleft lobe composed of the residues 100 to 115 centered at Ala 108 was responsible for the turnover in the reaction of HL against the bacterial cell wall substrate. The results revealed that the van der Waals contact between Glu 35 and Trp 109 was an essential determinant in the catalytic action of HL.
11336709	Crystal structure at 2.8 A of an FcRn/heterodimeric Fc complex: mechanism of pH-dependent binding.	The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) transports immunoglobulin G (IgG) across epithelia, binding IgG in acidic vesicles (pH < or = 6.5) and releasing IgG in the blood at pH 7.4. Well-ordered FcRn/Fc crystals are prevented by the formation of "oligomeric ribbons" of FcRn dimers bridged by Fc homodimers, thus we crystallized a 1:1 complex between rat FcRn and a heterodimeric Fc containing only one FcRn binding site. The 2.8 A complex structure demonstrates that FcRn uses its alpha2 and beta2-microglobulin domains and carbohydrate to interact with the Fc C(gamma)2-C(gamma)3 interface. The structure reveals conformational changes in Fc and three titratable salt bridges that confer pH-dependent binding, and can be used to guide rational design of therapeutic IgGs with longer serum half-lives.
15049684	Crystal structures of an intrinsically active cholera toxin mutant yield insight into the toxin activation mechanism.	Cholera toxin (CT) is a heterohexameric bacterial protein toxin belonging to a larger family of A/B ADP-ribosylating toxins. Each of these toxins undergoes limited proteolysis and/or disulfide bond reduction to form the enzymatically active toxic fragment. Nicking and reduction render both CT and the closely related heat-labile enterotoxin from Escherichia coli (LT) unstable in solution, thus far preventing a full structural understanding of the conformational changes resulting from toxin activation. We present the first structural glimpse of an active CT in structures from three crystal forms of a single-site A-subunit CT variant, Y30S, which requires no activational modifications for full activity. We also redetermined the structure of the wild-type, proenzyme CT from two crystal forms, both of which exhibit (i) better geometry and (ii) a different A2 "tail" conformation than the previously determined structure [Zhang et al. (1995) J. Mol. Biol. 251, 563-573]. Differences between wild-type CT and active CTY30S are observed in A-subunit loop regions that had been previously implicated in activation by analysis of the structure of an LT A-subunit R7K variant [van den Akker et al. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 10996-11004]. The 25-36 activation loop is disordered in CTY30S, while the 47-56 active site loop displays varying degrees of order in the three CTY30S structures, suggesting that disorder in the activation loop predisposes the active site loop to a greater degree of flexibility than that found in unactivated wild-type CT. On the basis of these six new views of the CT holotoxin, we propose a model for how the activational modifications experienced by wild-type CT are communicated to the active site.
9755858	SKAP-HOM, a novel adaptor protein homologous to the FYN-associated protein SKAP55.	A recombinant GST-Fyn-SH2 domain was used to purify proteins from lysates of pervanadate treated EL4 cells. N-terminal sequencing and molecular cloning of one of the purified polypeptides resulted in the identification of a novel adaptor protein that shares strong structural homology to the recently cloned Fyn-associated adaptor protein SKAP55. This protein was termed SKAP-HOM (SKAP55 homologue). Despite their striking homology, SKAP55 and SKAP-HOM have distinct characteristics. Thus, unlike SKAP55, which is exclusively expressed in T lymphocytes, SKAP-HOM expression is ubiquitous. Furthermore, while SKAP55 is constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated in resting human T cells, SKAP-HOM is expressed as a non-phosphorylated protein in the absence of external stimulus but becomes phosphorylated following T cell activation. In addition, SKAP-HOM does not associate with p59fyn in T cells although it represents a specific substrate for the kinase in COS cells. Finally, we demonstrate that, as previously shown for SKAP55, SKAP-HOM interacts with the recently identified polypeptide SLAP-130.
10926520	Crystal structure of glycosyltrehalose trehalohydrolase from the hyperthermophilic archaeum Sulfolobus solfataricus.	The crystal structure of glycosyltrehalose trehalohydrolase from the hyperthermophilic archaeum Sulfolobus solfataricus KM1 has been solved by multiple isomorphous replacement. The enzyme is an alpha-amylase (family 13) with unique exo-amylolytic activity for glycosyltrehalosides. It cleaves the alpha-1,4 glycosidic bond adjacent to the trehalose moiety to release trehalose and maltooligo saccharide. Unlike most other family 13 glycosidases, the enzyme does not require Ca(2+) for activity, and it contains an N-terminal extension of approximately 100 amino acid residues that is homologous to N-terminal domains found in many glycosidases that recognize branched oligosaccharides. Crystallography revealed the enzyme to exist as a homodimer covalently linked by an intermolecular disulfide bond at residue C298. The existence of the intermolecular disulfide bond was confirmed by biochemical analysis and mutagenesis. The N-terminal extension forms an independent domain connected to the catalytic domain by an extended linker. The functionally essential Ca(2+) binding site found in the B domain of alpha-amylases and many other family 13 glycosidases was found to be replaced by hydrophobic packing interactions. The enzyme also contains a very unusual excursion in the (beta/alpha)(8) barrel structure of the catalytic domain. This excursion originates from the bottom of the (beta/alpha)(8) barrel between helix 6 and strand 7, but folds upward in a distorted alpha-hairpin structure to form a part of the substrate binding cleft wall that is possibly critical for the enzyme's unique substrate selectivity. Participation of an alpha-beta loop in the formation of the substrate binding cleft is a novel feature that is not observed in other known (beta/alpha)(8) enzymes.
2548847	Structural factors that control conformational transitions and serotype specificity in type 3 poliovirus.	The three-dimensional structure of the Sabin strain of type 3 poliovirus has been determined at 2.4 A resolution. Significant structural differences with the Mahoney strain of type 1 poliovirus are confined to loops and terminal extensions of the capsid proteins, occur in all of the major antigenic sites of the virion and typically involve insertions, deletions or the replacement of prolines. Several newly identified components of the structure participate in assembly-dependent interactions which are relevant to the biologically important processes of viral assembly and uncoating. These include two sites of lipid substitution, two putative nucleotides and a beta sheet formed by the N-termini of capsid proteins VP4 and VP1. The structure provides an explanation for the temperature sensitive phenotype of the P3/Sabin strain. Amino acids that regulate temperature sensitivity in type 3 poliovirus are located in the interfaces between promoters, in the binding site for a lipid substituent and in an assembly-dependent extended beta sheet that stabilizes the association of pentamers. Several lines of evidence indicate that these structural components also control conformational transitions at various stages of the viral life cycle.
15201273	Structure--activity relationships of hainantoxin-IV and structure determination of active and inactive sodium channel blockers.	Hainantoxin-IV (HNTX-IV) can specifically inhibit the neuronal tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium channels and defines a new class of depressant spider toxin. The sequence of native HNTX-IV is ECLGFGKGCNPSNDQCCKSSNLVCSRKHRWCKYEI-NH(2). In the present study, to obtain further insight into the primary and tertiary structural requirements of neuronal sodium channel blockers, we determined the solution structure of HNTX-IV as a typical inhibitor cystine knot motif and synthesized four mutants designed based on the predicted sites followed by structural elucidation of two inactive mutants. Pharmacological studies indicated that the S12A and R26A mutants had activities near that of native HNTX-IV, while K27A and R29A demonstrated activities reduced by 2 orders of magnitude. (1)H MR analysis showed the similar molecular conformations for native HNTX-IV and four synthetic mutants. Furthermore, in the determined structures of K27A and R29A, the side chains of residues 27 and 29 were located in the identical spatial position to those of native HNTX-IV. These results suggested that residues Ser(12), Arg(26), Lys(27), and Arg(29) were not responsible for stabilizing the distinct conformation of HNTX-IV, but Lys(27) and Arg(29) were critical for the bioactivities. The potency reductions produced by Ala substitutions were primarily due to the direct interaction of the essential residues Lys(27) and Arg(29) with sodium channels rather than to a conformational change. After comparison of these structures and activities with correlated toxins, we hypothesized that residues Lys(27), Arg(29), His(28), Lys(32), Phe(5), and Trp(30) clustered on one face of HNTX-IV were responsible for ligand binding.
11866509	Chiral mutagenesis of insulin's hidden receptor-binding surface: structure of an allo-isoleucine(A2) analogue.	The hydrophobic core of vertebrate insulins contains an invariant isoleucine residue at position A2. Lack of variation may reflect this side-chain's dual contribution to structure and function: Ile(A2) is proposed both to stabilize the A1-A8 alpha-helix and to contribute to a "hidden" functional surface exposed on receptor binding. Substitution of Ile(A2) by alanine results in segmental unfolding of the A1-A8 alpha-helix, lower thermodynamic stability and impaired receptor binding. Such a spectrum of perturbations, although of biophysical interest, confounds interpretation of structure-activity relationships. To investigate the specific contribution of Ile(A2) to insulin's functional surface, we have employed non-standard mutagenesis: inversion of side-chain chirality in engineered monomer allo-Ile(A2)-DKP-insulin. Although the analogue retains native structure and stability, its affinity for the insulin receptor is impaired by 50-fold. Thus, whereas insulin's core readily accommodates allo-isoleucine at A2, its activity is exquisitely sensitive to chiral inversion. We propose that the Ile(A2) side-chain inserts within a chiral pocket of the receptor as part of insulin's hidden functional surface.
11800562	Crystal structures of mutant forms of the Bacillus caldolyticus cold shock protein differing in thermal stability.	The cold shock proteins Bc-Csp from the thermophile Bacillus caldolyticus and Bs-CspB from the mesophile Bacillus subtilis differ significantly in their conformational stability, although the two proteins differ by only 12 out of 67 amino acid residues. The three-dimensional structure of these small and compact beta-barrel proteins without disulfide bonds, cis-proline residues or tightly bound cofactors is very similar. Previous work has shown that Bc-Csp displays a twofold increase in the free energy of stabilization relative to its homolog Bs-CspB, and indicated that electrostatic interactions are, in part, responsible for this effect. It was further described that the stability difference is almost exclusively due to surface-exposed charged residues at sequence positions 3 and 66 of Bc-Csp and Bs-CspB, whereas all other amino acid changes between both proteins have no net effect on stability. To investigate how two surface residues determine the stability of Bc-Csp, Arg3 and Leu66 were replaced by glutamic acid, corresponding to the Bs-CspB sequence. The crystal structures of the resultant protein variants, Bc-Csp R3E and Bc-Csp L66E, were determined at 1.4 A and 1.27 A resolution, and refined to R values of 13.9 % and 15.8 %, respectively. Both structures closely resemble Bc-Csp in their global fold and show different hydrogen bonding and salt-bridge patterns when two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit of the crystal are compared. To extend the study to neighbored residues that help determine the surface charge around Arg3 and Leu66, the mutant proteins Bc-Csp E46A, Bc-Csp R3E/E46A/L66E and Bc-Csp V64T/L66E/67A were crystallized. Their structures were determined at resolutions of 1.8 A, 1.32 A and 1.8 A and refined to R values of 18.5 %, 13.8 % and 19.3 %, respectively. A systematic comparison of the crystal structures of all forms of the B. caldolyticus cold shock protein shows varying patterns of hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions around residues 3 and 66. Thermal destabilization of the protein by mutation appears to correlate with the extent of an acidic surface patch near the C-terminal carboxylate group.
10545326	Metal-ion affinity and specificity in EF-hand proteins: coordination geometry and domain plasticity in parvalbumin.	BACKGROUND: The EF-hand family is a large set of Ca(2+)-binding proteins that contain characteristic helix-loop-helix binding motifs that are highly conserved in sequence. Members of this family include parvalbumin and many prominent regulatory proteins such as calmodulin and troponin C. EF-hand proteins are involved in a variety of physiological processes including cell-cycle regulation, second messenger production, muscle contraction, microtubule organization and vision. RESULTS: We have determined the structures of parvalbumin mutants designed to explore the role of the last coordinating residue of the Ca(2+)-binding loop. An E101D substitution has been made in the parvalbumin EF site. The substitution decreases the Ca(2+)-binding affinity 100-fold and increases the Mg(2+)-binding affinity 10-fold. Both the Ca(2+)- and Mg(2+)-bound structures have been determined, and a structural basis has been proposed for the metal-ion-binding properties. CONCLUSIONS: The E101D mutation does not affect the Mg(2+) coordination geometry of the binding loop, but it does pull the F helix 1.1 A towards the loop. The E101D-Ca(2+) structure reveals that this mutant cannot obtain the sevenfold coordination preferred by Ca(2+), presumably because of strain limits imposed by tertiary structure. Analysis of these results relative to previously reported structural information supports a model wherein the characteristics of the last coordinating residue and the plasticity of the Ca(2+)-binding loop delimit the allowable geometries for the coordinating sphere.
15610023	Toward the insulin-IGF-I intermediate structures: functional and structural properties of the [TyrB25NMePheB26] insulin mutant.	The origins of differentiation of insulin from insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) are still unknown. To address the problem of a structural and biological switch from the mostly metabolic hormonal activity of insulin to the predominant growth factor activities of IGF-I, an insulin analogue with IGF-I-like structural features has been synthesized. Insulin residues Phe(B25) and Tyr(B26) have been swapped with the IGF-I-like Tyr(24) and Phe(25) sequence with a simultaneous methylation of the peptide nitrogen of residue Phe(B26). These modifications were expected to introduce a substantial kink in the main chain, as observed at residue Phe(25) in the IGF-I crystal structure. These alterations should provide insight into the structural origins of insulin-IGF-I structural and functional divergence. The [Tyr(B25)NMePhe(B26)] mutant has been characterized, and its crystal structure has been determined. Surprisingly, all of these changes are well accommodated within an insulin R6 hexamer. Only one molecule of each dimer in the hexamer responds to the structural alterations, the other remaining very similar to wild-type insulin. All alterations, modest in their scale, cumulate in the C-terminal part of the B-chain (residues B23-B30), which moves toward the core of the insulin molecule and is associated with a significant shift of the A1 helix toward the C-terminus of the B-chain. These changes do not produce the expected bend of the main chain, but the fold of the mutant does reflect some structural characteristics of IGF-1, and in addition establishes the CO(A19)-NH(B25) hydrogen bond, which is normally characteristic of T-state insulin.
15128738	Atomic resolution structures and solution behavior of enzyme-substrate complexes of Enterobacter cloacae PB2 pentaerythritol tetranitrate reductase. Multiple conformational states and implications for the mechanism of nitroaromatic explosive degradation.	The structure of pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) reductase in complex with the nitroaromatic substrate picric acid determined previously at 1.55 A resolution indicated additional electron density between the indole ring of residue Trp-102 and the nitro group at C-6 of picrate. The data suggested the presence of an unusual bond between substrate and the tryptophan side chain. Herein, we have extended the resolution of the PETN reductase-picric acid complex to 0.9 A. This high-resolution analysis indicates that the active site is partially occupied with picric acid and that the anomalous density seen in the original study is attributed to the population of multiple conformational states of Trp-102 and not a formal covalent bond between the indole ring of Trp-102 and picric acid. The significance of any interaction between Trp-102 and nitroaromatic substrates was probed further in solution and crystal complexes with wild-type and mutant (W102Y and W102F) enzymes. Unlike with wild-type enzyme, in the crystalline form picric acid was bound at full occupancy in the mutant enzymes, and there was no evidence for multiple conformations of active site residues. Solution studies indicate tighter binding of picric acid in the active sites of the W102Y and W102F enzymes. Mutation of Trp-102 does not impair significantly enzyme reduction by NADPH, but the kinetics of decay of the hydride-Meisenheimer complex are accelerated in the mutant enzymes. The data reveal that decay of the hydride-Meisenheimer complex is enzyme catalyzed and that the final distribution of reaction products for the mutant enzymes is substantially different from wild-type enzyme. Implications for the mechanism of high explosive degradation by PETN reductase are discussed.
10964705	Crystal structures of the ribonuclease MC1 from bitter gourd seeds, complexed with 2'-UMP or 3'-UMP, reveal structural basis for uridine specificity.	Ribonuclease MC1 (RNase MC1) isolated from seeds of bitter gourd (Momordica charantia) consists of 190 amino acids and is characterized by a preferential cleavage at the 5'-side of uridine. This uridine specificity distinguishes RNase MC1 from other enzymes belonging to the RNase T2 family. The three-dimensional structures of RNase MC1, in a complex with either 2'-UMP or 3'-UMP, were determined at 1.48 and 1.77 A resolutions, respectively. The side chains of Gln9 and Asn71 interact with O4 and N3, respectively, of the uracil base by hydrogen bondings. In addition, the uracil base is sandwiched by the hydrophobic side chains of Leu73 and Phe80. Compared with these amino acid residues and corresponding residues in RNases in the RNase T2 family, Gln9 and Phe80 are highly conserved in the RNases in T2 family, while Asn71 and Leu73 in RNase MC1 are variant in sequences. It is thus likely that interactions of the side chains of Asn71 and Leu73 with the uracil base are responsible for the absolute uridine specificity of RNase MC1. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments showed that replacement of Asn by Thr decreased both the catalytic efficiency and the binding affinity by 2.3- and 7.0-fold, respectively, and substitution of Leu73 for Ala predominantly decreased the binding affinity by 14. 5-fold, compared with findings in case of wild-type RNase MC1. It is thus demonstrated that Asn71 and Leu73 play an essential role in uridine preference for RNase MC1.
16229465	Crystal structure of Methanococcus voltae RadA in complex with ADP: hydrolysis-induced conformational change.	Members of a superfamily of RecA-like recombinases facilitate a central strand exchange reaction in the DNA repair process. Archaeal RadA and Rad51 and eukaryal Rad51 and meiosis-specific DMC1 form a closely related group of recombinases distinct from bacterial RecA. Nevertheless, all such recombinases share a conserved core domain which carries the ATPase site and putative DNA-binding sites. Here we present the crystal structure of an archaeal RadA from Methanococcus voltae (MvRadA) in complex with ADP and Mg2+ at 2.1 A resolution. The crystallized RadA-ADP filament has an extended helical pitch similar to those of previously determined structures in the presence of nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue AMP-PNP. Structural comparison reveals two recurrent conformations with an extensive allosteric effect spanning the ATPase site and the putative DNA-binding L2 region. Varied conformations of the L2 region also imply a dynamic nature of recombinase-bound DNA.
10490031	Structures of a histone deacetylase homologue bound to the TSA and SAHA inhibitors.	Histone deacetylases (HDACs) mediate changes in nucleosome conformation and are important in the regulation of gene expression. HDACs are involved in cell-cycle progression and differentiation, and their deregulation is associated with several cancers. HDAC inhibitors, such as trichostatin A (TSA) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), have anti-tumour effects, as they can inhibit cell growth, induce terminal differentiation and prevent the formation of tumours in mice models, and they are effective in the treatment of promyelocytic leukemia. Here we describe the structure of the histone deacetylase catalytic core, as revealed by the crystal structure of a homologue from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus, that shares 35.2% identity with human HDAC1 over 375 residues, deacetylates histones in vitro and is inhibited by TSA and SAHA. The deacetylase, deacetylase-TSA and deacetylase-SAHA structures reveal an active site consisting of a tubular pocket, a zinc-binding site and two Asp-His charge-relay systems, and establish the mechanism of HDAC inhibition. The residues that make up the active site and contact the inhibitors are conserved across the HDAC family. These structures also suggest a mechanism for the deacetylation reaction and provide a framework for the further development of HDAC inhibitors as antitumour agents.
15272161	The role of substrate-binding groups in the mechanism of aspartate-beta-semialdehyde dehydrogenase.	The reversible dephosphorylation of beta-aspartyl phosphate to L-aspartate-beta-semialdehyde (ASA) in the aspartate biosynthetic pathway is catalyzed by aspartate-beta-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (ASADH). The product of this reaction is a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of diaminopimelic acid, an integral component of bacterial cell walls and a metabolic precursor of lysine and also a precursor in the biosynthesis of threonine, isoleucine and methionine. The structures of selected Haemophilus influenzae ASADH mutants were determined in order to evaluate the residues that are proposed to interact with the substrates ASA or phosphate. The substrate Km values are not altered by replacement of either an active-site arginine (Arg270) with a lysine or a putative phosphate-binding group (Lys246) with an arginine. However, the interaction of phosphate with the enzyme is adversely affected by replacement of Arg103 with lysine and is significantly altered when a neutral leucine is substituted at this position. A conservative Glu243 to aspartate mutant does not alter either ASA or phosphate binding, but instead results in an eightfold increase in the Km for the coenzyme NADP. Each of the mutations is shown to cause specific subtle active-site structural alterations and each of these changes results in decreases in catalytic efficiency ranging from significant (approximately 3% native activity) to substantial (<0.1% native activity).
12554829	Structure and allosteric regulation of the alpha X beta 2 integrin I domain.	The integrin alpha X beta 2 (CD11c/CD18, p150,95) binds ligands through the I domain of the alpha X subunit. Ligands include the complement factor fragment iC3b, a key component in the innate immune defense, which, together with the expression of alpha X beta 2 on dendritic cells and on other leukocytes, suggests a role in the immune response. We now report the structure of the alpha X I domain resolved at 1.65 A by x-ray crystallography. To analyze structural requirements for ligand binding we made a mutation in the alpha X I domain C-terminal helix, which increased the affinity for iC3b approximately 200-fold to 2.4 microM compared with the wild-type domain affinity of approximately 400 microM. Gel permeation chromatography supported a conformational change between the wild-type and mutated domains. Conservation of allosteric regulation in the alpha X I domain points to the functional importance of this phenomenon.
9032381	The refined crystal structure of the 3C gene product from hepatitis A virus: specific proteinase activity and RNA recognition.	The virally encoded 3C proteinases of picornaviruses process the polyprotein produced by the translation of polycistronic viral mRNA. The X-ray crystallographic structure of a catalytically active mutant of the hepatitis A virus (HAV) 3C proteinase (C24S) has been determined. Crystals of this mutant of HAV 3C are triclinic with unit cell dimensions a = 53.6 A, b = 53.5 A, c = 53.2 A, alpha = 99.1 degrees, beta = 129.0 degrees, and gamma = 103.3 degrees. There are two molecules of HAV 3C in the unit cell of this crystal form. The structure has been refined to an R factor of 0.211 (Rfree = 0.265) at 2.0-A resolution. Both molecules fold into the characteristic two-domain structure of the chymotrypsin-like serine proteinases. The active-site and substrate-binding regions are located in a surface groove between the two beta-barrel domains. The catalytic Cys 172 S(gamma) and His 44 N(epsilon2) are separated by 3.9 A; the oxyanion hole adopts the same conformation as that seen in the serine proteinases. The side chain of Asp 84, the residue expected to form the third member of the catalytic triad, is pointed away from the side chain of His 44 and is locked in an ion pair interaction with the epsilon-amino group of Lys 202. A water molecule is hydrogen bonded to His 44 N(delta1). The side-chain phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr 143 is close to this water and to His 44 N(delta1) and may be negatively charged. The glutamine specificity for P1 residues of substrate cleavage sites is attributed to the presence of a highly conserved His 191 in the S1 pocket. A very unusual environment of two water molecules and a buried glutamate contribute to the imidazole tautomer believed to be important in the P1 specificity. HAV 3C proteinase has the conserved RNA recognition sequence KFRDI located in the interdomain connection loop on the side of the molecule diametrically opposite the proteolytic site. This segment of polypeptide is located between the N- and C-terminal helices, and its conformation results in the formation of a well-defined surface with a strongly charged electrostatic potential. Presumably, this surface of HAV 3C participates in the recognition of the 5' and 3' nontranslated regions of the RNA genome during viral replication.
15273277	Identification of important chemical groups of the hut mRNA for HutP interactions that regulate the hut operon in Bacillus subtilis.	HutP is an RNA binding protein that regulates the expression of the histidine utilization (hut) operon in Bacillus species by binding to cis-acting regulatory sequences on hut mRNA. We recently solved the HutP crystal structure, which revealed a novel fold where three dimers are arranged in a 3-fold axis to form the hexamer. We also identified a minimal RNA binding element sufficient for HutP binding: three UAG trinucleotide motifs, each separated by 4 nt, located just upstream of the terminator. In the present study we have identified important RNA chemical groups essential for HutP interactions, by combining an in vitro selection strategy and analyses by site-specific base substitutions. These analyses suggest that each HutP molecule recognizes one UAG motif, where the first base (U) can be substituted with other bases, while the second and third bases (A and G) are required for the interactions. Further analyses of the chemical groups of the A and G bases in the UAG motif by modified base analogs suggested the importance of the exocyclic NH2 group in these bases. Also, in this motif, only the 2'-OH group of A is important for HutP recognition. Considering the important chemical groups identified here, as well as the electrostatic potential analysis of HutP, we propose that Glu137 is one of the important residues for the HutP-RNA interactions.
8555209	Contribution of cutinase serine 42 side chain to the stabilization of the oxyanion transition state.	Cutinase from the fungus Fusarium solani pisi is a lipolytic enzyme able to hydrolyze both aggregated and soluble substrates. It therefore provides a powerful tool for probing the mechanisms underlying lipid hydrolysis. Lipolytic enzymes have a catalytic machinery similar to those present in serine proteinases. It is characterized by the triad Ser, His, and Asp (Glu) residues, by an oxyanion binding site that stabilizes the transition state via hydrogen bonds with two main chain amide groups, and possibly by other determinants. It has been suggested on the basis of a covalently bond inhibitor that the cutinase oxyanion hole may consist not only of two main chain amide groups but also of the Ser42 O gamma side chain. Among the esterases and the serine and the cysteine proteases, only Streptomyces scabies esterase, subtilisin, and papain, respectively, have a side chain residue which is involved in the oxyanion hole formation. The position of the cutinase Ser42 side chain is structurally conserved in Rhizomucor miehei lipase with Ser82 O gamma, in Rhizopus delemar lipase with Thr83 O gamma 1, and in Candida antartica B lipase with Thr40 O gamma 1. To evaluate the increase in the tetrahedral intermediate stability provided by Ser42 O gamma, we mutated Ser42 into Ala. Furthermore, since the proper orientation of Ser42 O gamma is directed by Asn84, we mutated Asn84 into Ala, Leu, Asp, and Trp, respectively, to investigate the contribution of this indirect interaction to the stabilization of the oxyanion hole. The S42A mutation resulted in a drastic decrease in the activity (450-fold) without significantly perturbing the three-dimensional structure. The N84A and N84L mutations had milder kinetic effects and did not disrupt the structure of the active site, whereas the N84W and N84D mutations abolished the enzymatic activity due to drastic steric and electrostatic effects, respectively.
9030762	NMR solution structure of an oxidised thioredoxin h from the eukaryotic green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.	NMR solution structures of a cytosolic plant thioredoxin h (112 amino acids, 11.7 kDa) from the green alga Chlamydonmonas reinhardtii have been calculated on the basis of 1904 NMR distance restraints, which include 90 distances used to restrain 45 hydrogen bonds, and 44 phi dihedral restraints. The structure of C. reinhardtii thioredoxin h was solved in its oxidised form, and the ensemble of 23 converged structures superpose to the geometric average structure with an atomic rmsd of 0.080 nm +/- 0.016 for the (N, C(alpha), C) backbone atoms of residues 4-110. Comparisons with other thioredoxins, such as thioredoxin from the bacterium Escherichia coli, thioredoxin 2 from a cyanobacterium of the Anabaena genus, and human thioredoxin, showed that thioredoxin h models share more structural features with human thioredoxin than with other bacterial thioredoxins. Examination of the accessible surface around the redoxactive peptide sequence indicates that a potent thioredoxin-h-substrate interaction could be similar to the vertebrate thioredoxin-substrate interactions.
7473760	Contribution of hydrophobic residues to the stability of human lysozyme: calorimetric studies and X-ray structural analysis of the five isoleucine to valine mutants.	In order to understand the contribution of hydrophobic residues to the conformational stability of human lysozyme, five Ile mutants (Ile --> Val) in the interior of the protein were constructed. The thermodynamic parameters characterizing the denaturation of these mutant proteins were determined by scanning calorimetry, and the three-dimensional structure of each mutant protein was solved at high resolution by X-ray crystallography. The thermodynamic analyses at 64.9 degrees C and at pH 2.7 revealed the following. (1) The stabilities of all the mutant proteins were decreased as compared with that of the wild-type protein. (2) The changes in the calorimetric enthalpies were larger than those in the Gibbs energies, and were compensated by entropy changes. (3) The destabilization mechanism of the mutant proteins differs, depending on the location of the mutation sites. X-ray analyses showed that the overall structures of all the mutant human lysozymes examined were identical to that of the wild-type protein, and only small structural rearrangements were observed locally around some of the mutation sites. The most striking change among the mutant proteins was found in the mutant protein, 159V, which contains a new water molecule in the cavity created by the mutation. The thermodynamic stabilities of the mutant proteins are discussed in light of the high-resolution X-ray structures of the wild-type and five mutant human lysozymes examined.
11353825	Strong DNA binding by covalently linked dimeric Lac headpiece: evidence for the crucial role of the hinge helices.	The combined structural and biochemical studies on Lac repressor bound to operator DNA have demonstrated the central role of the hinge helices in operator bending and the induction mechanism. We have constructed a covalently linked dimeric Lac-headpiece that binds DNA with four orders of magnitude higher affinity as compared with the monomeric form. This enabled a detailed biochemical and structural study of Lac binding to its cognate wild-type and selected DNA operators. The results indicate a profound contribution of hinge helices to the stability of the protein-DNA complex and highlight their central role in operator recognition. Furthermore, protein-DNA interactions in the minor groove appear to modulate hinge helix stability, thus accounting for affinity differences and protein-induced DNA bending among the various operator sites. Interestingly, the in vitro DNA-binding affinity of the reported dimeric Lac construct can de readily modulated by simple adjustment of redox conditions, thus rendering it a potential artificial gene regulator.
7556224	Changing the reaction specificity of a pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme.	The electron distribution in the coenzyme-substrate adduct of aspartate aminotransferase was changed by replacing active-site Arg386 with alanine and introducing a new arginine residue nearby. [Y225R, R386A]Aspartate aminotransferase decarboxylates L-aspartate to L-alanine (kcat = 0.04 s-1), while its transaminase activity towards dicarboxylic amino acids is decreased by three orders of magnitude (kcat = 0.19 s-1). Molecular-dynamics simulations based on the crystal structure of the mutant enzyme suggest that a new hydrogen bond to the imine N atom of the pyridoxal-5'-phosphate- aspartate adduct and an altered electrostatic potential around its beta-carboxylate group underlie the 650,000-fold increase in the ratio of beta-decarboxylase/transaminase activity.
8142383	Small molecule binding to an artificially created cavity at the active site of cytochrome c peroxidase.	In the oxidized "ES" state of cytochrome c peroxidase, Trp-191 is reversibly oxidized to a stable cation free radical by the hypervalent heme. To explore the potential for engineering a binding site for heterocyclic compounds at this site, the mutant W191G was constructed. Two independent crystal structures of W191G at 2.1- and 2.3-A resolution show that W191G contains a well-defined, approximately 180-A3 cavity at the Trp-191 site. The cavity is occupied by five ordered water molecules which participate in an extensive hydrogen-bonding network with each other, with polar main-chain atoms, and with the carboxylate of Asp-235. After a number of heterocyclic compounds were screened, evidence was obtained that substituted imidazoles bind to the cavity of W191G. Titration of W191G with imidazole resulted in a perturbation of the Soret absorption band that was not observed for W191H, W191F, or the native enzyme. The dissociation constants for binding of benzimidazole, imidazole, 2-ethylimidazole, 1-methylimidazole, 2-methylimidazole, and 1,2-dimethylimidazole to W191G were respectively 2.58, 0.70, 0.36, 0.057, 0.047, and 0.027 mM at pH 6.0. The highest binding affinity was exhibited by 1,2-dimethylimidazole, indicating that steric interactions and the efficiency of filling the cavity are important determinants for specificity. The Kd for imidazole binding increased from 0.7 mM at pH 6 to 3.0 mM at pH 8 and could be fit to a single proton ionization curve with a pKa of 7.4, demonstrating the preferential binding by the imidazolium ion (pKa = 7.3). The binding of a number of substituted imidazoles to the cavity of W191G was verified by X-ray crystallographic analysis. The most clearly defined density was observed for W191G crystals soaked in 1 mM 1,2-dimethylimidazole and was consistent with an oriented occupation in which the unsubstituted nitrogen forms a hydrogen bond or ion pair interaction with Asp-235. Thus, enhanced binding of positively charged molecules may be the result of interactions with this carboxylate. An analogous interaction may stabilize the developing positive charge on the Trp-191 radical of the wild-type enzyme. While the oxidation of imidazoles by the ferryl intermediate of W191G was neither expected nor observed, this study has defined the structural determinants for small molecule binding to an artificially created cavity near a heme center which is capable of generating oxidized species at a potential of over 1 V, and these results will guide future attempts for novel substrate oxidation by CCP.
14718923	Structural basis for dipeptide amide isoform-selective inhibition of neuronal nitric oxide synthase.	Three nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms, eNOS, nNOS and iNOS, generate nitric oxide (NO) crucial to the cardiovascular, nervous and host defense systems, respectively. Development of isoform-selective NOS inhibitors is of considerable therapeutic importance. Crystal structures of nNOS-selective dipeptide inhibitors in complex with both nNOS and eNOS were solved and the inhibitors were found to adopt a curled conformation in nNOS but an extended conformation in eNOS. We hypothesized that a single-residue difference in the active site, Asp597 (nNOS) versus Asn368 (eNOS), is responsible for the favored binding in nNOS. In the D597N nNOS mutant crystal structure, a bound inhibitor switches to the extended conformation and its inhibition of nNOS decreases >200-fold. Therefore, a single-residue difference is responsible for more than two orders of magnitude selectivity in inhibition of nNOS over eNOS by L-N(omega)-nitroarginine-containing dipeptide inhibitors.
11851415	Cation-induced stabilization of the engineered cation-binding loop in cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP).	We have previously shown that the K(+) site found in the proximal heme pocket of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) could be successfully engineered into the closely homologous cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP) [Bonagura et al., (1996) Biochemistry 35, 6107-6115; Bonagura et al. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 5538-5545]. In addition, specificity could be switched to binding Ca(2+) as found in other peroxidases [Bonagura et al. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 37827-37833]. The introduction of a proximal cation-binding site also promotes conversion of the Trp191 containing cation-binding loop from a "closed" to an "open" conformer. In the present study we have changed a crucial hinge residue of the cation-binding loop, Asn195, to Pro which stabilizes the loop, albeit, only in the presence of bound K(+). The crystal structure of this mutant, N195PK2, has been refined to 1.9 A. As predicted, introduction of this crucial hinge residue stabilizes the cation-binding loop in the presence of the bound K(+). As in earlier work, the characteristic EPR signal of Trp191 cation radical becomes progressively weaker with increasing [K(+)] and the lifetime of the Trp191 radical also has been considerably shortened in this mutant. This mutant CcP exhibits reduced enzyme activity, which could be titrated to lower levels with increasing [K(+)] when horse heart cytochrome c is the substrate. However, with yeast cytochrome c as the substrate, the mutant was as active as wild-type at low ionic strength, but 40-fold lower at high ionic strength. We attribute this difference to a change in the rate-limiting step as a function of ionic strength when yeast cytochrome c is the substrate.
11021969	Three-dimensional structure of a human pancreatic ribonuclease variant, a step forward in the design of cytotoxic ribonucleases.	We have determined the crystal structure of a human pancreatic ribonuclease or RNase 1 variant at 1.65 A resolution. Five residues in the N-terminal region were substituted by the corresponding amino acids of the bovine seminal RNase. In addition, a Pro to Ser mutation was present at position 50. The substitution of part of the N terminus has been critical both in improving the expression of this enzyme as a recombinant protein and in achieving its crystallisation. The determination of the crystal structure revealed the characteristic RNase fold including a V-shaped beta-sheet and three alpha-helices. It differs from its bovine RNase orthologue mainly in the loop regions. The active-site cleft shows a similar architecture to that of its bovine counterpart, with the essential residues occupying equivalent positions. In the present structure, however, His119 is displaced as it is in the structure of RNase A at high pH. An interaction model of human ribonuclease with the ribonuclease inhibitor, together with inhibition assays, indicate that, in contrast to RNase A, the modification of the loop beta4beta5 is not enough to avoid inhibition. This study represents the first crystallographic approach to the human enzyme, and should constitute an invaluable tool for the design of ribonuclease variants with acquired cytotoxic properties.
8003964	Enzyme IIBcellobiose of the phosphoenol-pyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system of Escherichia coli: backbone assignment and secondary structure determined by three-dimensional NMR spectroscopy.	The assignment of backbone resonances and the secondary structure determination of the Cys 10 Ser mutant of enzyme IIBcellobiose of the Escherichia coli cellobiose-specific phosphoenol-pyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system are presented. The backbone resonances were assigned using 4 triple resonance experiments, the HNCA and HN(CO)CA experiments, correlating backbone 1H, 15N, and 13C alpha resonances, and the HN(CA)CO and HNCO experiments, correlating backbone 1H,15N and 13CO resonances. Heteronuclear 1H-NOE 1H-15N single quantum coherence (15N-NOESY-HSQC) spectroscopy and heteronuclear 1H total correlation 1H-15N single quantum coherence (15N-TOCSY-HSQC) spectroscopy were used to resolve ambiguities arising from overlapping 13C alpha and 13CO frequencies and to check the assignments from the triple resonance experiments. This procedure, together with a 3-dimensional 1H alpha-13C alpha-13CO experiment (COCAH), yielded the assignment for all observed backbone resonances. The secondary structure was determined using information both from the deviation of observed 1H alpha and 13C alpha chemical shifts from their random coil values and 1H-NOE information from the 15N-NOESY-HSQC. These data show that enzyme IIBcellobiose consists of a 4-stranded parallel beta-sheet and 5 alpha-helices. In the wild-type enzyme IIBcellobiose, the catalytic residue appears to be located at the end of a beta-strand.
2163605	Disulphide bond assignment in human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP).	Disulphide bonds in human recombinant tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) were assigned by resolving proteolytic digests of TIMP on reverse-phase h.p.l.c. and sequencing those peaks judged to contain disulphide bonds by virtue of a change in retention time on reduction. This procedure allowed the direct assignment of Cys-145-Cys-166 and the isolation of two other peptides containing two disulphide bonds each. Further peptide cleavage in conjunction with fast-atom-bombardment m.s. analysis permitted the assignments Cys-1-Cys-70, Cys-3-Cys-99, Cys-13-Cys-124 and Cys-127-Cys-174 from these peptides. The sixth bond Cys-132-Cys-137 was assigned by inference, as the native protein has no detectable free thiol groups.
16157350	Oligosaccharide preferences of beta1,4-galactosyltransferase-I: crystal structures of Met340His mutant of human beta1,4-galactosyltransferase-I with a pentasaccharide and trisaccharides of the N-glycan moiety.	beta-1,4-Galactosyltransferase-I (beta4Gal-T1) transfers galactose from UDP-galactose to N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues of the branched N-linked oligosaccharide chains of glycoproteins. In an N-linked biantennary oligosaccharide chain, one antenna is attached to the 3-hydroxyl-(1,3-arm), and the other to the 6-hydroxyl-(1,6-arm) group of mannose, which is beta-1,4-linked to an N-linked chitobiose, attached to the aspargine residue of a protein. For a better understanding of the branch specificity of beta4Gal-T1 towards the GlcNAc residues of N-glycans, we have carried out kinetic and crystallographic studies with the wild-type human beta4Gal-T1 (h-beta4Gal-T1) and the mutant Met340His-beta4Gal-T1 (h-M340H-beta4Gal-T1) in complex with a GlcNAc-containing pentasaccharide and several GlcNAc-containing trisaccharides present in N-glycans. The oligosaccharides used were: pentasaccharide GlcNAcbeta1,2-Manalpha1,6 (GlcNAcbeta1,2-Manalpha1,3)Man; the 1,6-arm trisaccharide, GlcNAcbeta1,2-Manalpha1,6-Manbeta-OR (1,2-1,6-arm); the 1,3-arm trisaccharides, GlcNAcbeta1,2-Manalpha1,3-Manbeta-OR (1,2-1,3-arm) and GlcNAcbeta1,4-Manalpha1,3-Manbeta-OR (1,4-1,3-arm); and the trisaccharide GlcNAcbeta1,4-GlcNAcbeta1,4-GlcNAc (chitotriose). With the wild-type h-beta4Gal-T1, the K(m) of 1,2-1,6-arm is approximately tenfold lower than for 1,2-1,3-arm and 1,4-1,3-arm, and 22-fold lower than for chitotriose. Crystal structures of h-M340H-beta4Gal-T1 in complex with the pentasaccharide and various trisaccharides at 1.9-2.0A resolution showed that beta4Gal-T1 is in a closed conformation with the oligosaccharide bound to the enzyme, and the 1,2-1,6-arm trisaccharide makes the maximum number of interactions with the enzyme, which is in concurrence with the lowest K(m) for the trisaccharide. Present studies suggest that beta4Gal-T1 interacts preferentially with the 1,2-1,6-arm trisaccharide rather than with the 1,2-1,3-arm or 1,4-1,3-arm of a bi- or tri-antennary oligosaccharide chain of N-glycan.
15784976	A series of crystal structures of a meta-cleavage product hydrolase from Pseudomonas fluorescens IP01 (CumD) complexed with various cleavage products.	Meta-cleavage product hydrolase (MCP-hydrolase) is one of the key enzymes in the microbial degradation of aromatic compounds. MCP-hydrolase produces 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate and various organic acids, according to the C6 substituent of the substrate. Comprehensive analysis of the substrate specificity of the MCP-hydrolase from Pseudomonas fluorescens IP01 (CumD) was carried out by determining the kinetic parameters for nine substrates and crystal structures complexed with eight cleavage products. CumD preferred substrates with long non-branched C6 substituents, but did not effectively hydrolyze a substrate with a phenyl group. Superimposition of the complex structures indicated that benzoate was bound in a significantly different direction than other aliphatic cleavage products. The directions of the bound organic acids appeared to be related with the k(cat) values of the corresponding substrates. The Ile139 and Trp143 residues on helix alpha4 appeared to cause steric hindrance with the aromatic ring of the substrate, which hampers base-catalyzed attack by water.
6310508	The nucleotide sequence of poliovirus type 3 leon 12 a1b: comparison with poliovirus type 1.	The complete nucleotide sequence of the genome of the Sabin vaccine strain of poliovirus type 3 (P3/Leon 12 a1 b) has been determined from cDNA cloned in E. coli. The genome comprises a 5' non-coding region of 742 nucleotides, a large open reading frame of 6618 nucleotides (89% of the sequence) and a 3' non-coding region of 72 nucleotides. There is 77.4% base-sequence homology and 89.6% predicted amino-acid homology between types 1 and 3. Conservation of all glutamine-glycine and tyrosine-glycine cleavage sites suggests a mechanism of polyprotein processing similar to that established for poliovirus type 1.
12902323	Roles of His291-alpha and His146-beta' in the reductive acylation reaction catalyzed by human branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase: refined phosphorylation loop structure in the active site.	We report here that alterations of either His291-alpha or His146-beta' in the active site of human branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (E1b) impede both the decarboxylation and the reductive acylation reactions catalyzed by E1b as well as the binding of cofactor thiamin diphosphate (ThDP). In a refined human E1b active-site structure, His291-alpha, which aligns with His407 in Escherichia coli pyruvate dehydrogenase and His263 in yeast transketolase, is on a largely ordered phosphorylation loop. The imidazole ring of His291-alpha in E1b coordinates to the terminal phosphate oxygen atoms of bound ThDP. The N3 atom of wild-type His146-beta', which can be protonated, binds a water molecule and points toward the aminopyrimidine ring of ThDP. Remarkably, the H291A-alpha mutation results in a complete order-to-disorder transition of the loop region, which precludes the binding of the substrate lipoyl-bearing domain to E1b. The H146A-beta' mutation, on the other hand, does not alter the loop structure, but nullifies the reductive acylation activity of E1b. Our results suggest that: 1) His291-alpha plays a structural rather than a catalytic role in the binding of cofactor ThDP and the lipoyl-bearing domain to E1b, and 2) His146-beta' is an essential catalytic residue, probably functioning as a proton donor in the reductive acylation of lipoamide on the lipoyl-bearing domain.
10669610	Structural basis for the higher Ca(2+)-activation of the regulated actin-activated myosin ATPase observed with Dictyostelium/Tetrahymena actin chimeras.	Replacement of residues 228-230 or 228-232 of subdomain 4 in Dictyostelium actin with the corresponding Tetrahymena sequence (QTA to KAY replacement: half chimera-1; QTAAS to KAYKE replacement: full chimera) leads to a higher Ca(2+)-activation of the regulated acto-myosin subfragment-1 ATPase activity. The ratio of ATPase activation in the presence of tropomyosin-troponin and Ca(2+) to that without tropomyosin-troponin becomes about four times as large as the ratio for the wild-type actin. To understand the structural basis of this higher Ca(2+)-activation, we have determined the crystal structures of the 1:1 complex of Dictyostelium mutant actins (half chimera-1 and full chimera) with gelsolin segment-1 to 2.0 A and 2.4 A resolution, respectively, together with the structure of wild-type actin as a control. Although there were local changes on the surface of the subdomain 4 and the phenolic side-chain of Tyr230 displaced the side-chain of Leu236 from a non-polar pocket to a more solvent-accessible position, the structures of the actin chimeras showed that the mutations in the 228-232 region did not introduce large changes in the overall actin structure. This suggests that residues near position 230 formed part of the tropomyosin binding site on actin in actively contracting muscle. The higher Ca(2+)-activation observed with A230Y-containing mutants can be understood in terms of a three-state model for thin filament regulation in which, in the presence of both Ca(2+) and myosin heads, the local changes of actin generated by the mutation (especially its phenolic side-chain) facilitate the transition of thin filaments from a "closed" state to an "open" state. Between 394 and 469 water molecules were identified in the different structures and it was found that actin recognizes hydrated forms of the adenine base and the Ca ion in the nucleotide binding site.
10899999	NMR structure of the bovine prion protein.	The NMR structures of the recombinant 217-residue polypeptide chain of the mature bovine prion protein, bPrP(23-230), and a C-terminal fragment, bPrP(121-230), include a globular domain extending from residue 125 to residue 227, a short flexible chain end of residues 228-230, and an N-terminal flexibly disordered "tail" comprising 108 residues for the intact protein and 4 residues for bPrP(121-230), respectively. The globular domain contains three alpha-helices comprising the residues 144-154, 173-194, and 200-226, and a short antiparallel beta-sheet comprising the residues 128-131 and 161-164. The best-defined parts of the globular domain are the central portions of the helices 2 and 3, which are linked by the only disulfide bond in bPrP. Significantly increased disorder and mobility is observed for helix 1, the loop 166-172 leading from the beta-strand 2 to helix 2, the end of helix 2 and the following loop, and the last turn of helix 3. Although there are characteristic local differences relative to the conformations of the murine and Syrian hamster prion proteins, the bPrP structure is essentially identical to that of the human prion protein. On the other hand, there are differences between bovine and human PrP in the surface distribution of electrostatic charges, which then appears to be the principal structural feature of the "healthy" PrP form that might affect the stringency of the species barrier for transmission of prion diseases between humans and cattle.
1380671	Crystal structures explain functional properties of two E. coli porins.	Porins form aqueous channels that aid the diffusion of small hydrophilic molecules across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. The crystal structures of matrix porin and phosphoporin both reveal trimers of identical subunits, each subunit consisting of a 16-stranded anti-parallel beta-barrel containing a pore. A long loop inside the barrel contributes to a constriction of the channel where the charge distribution affects ion selectivity. The structures explain at the molecular level functional characteristics and their alterations by known mutations.
12717027	The catalytic mechanism of galactose mutarotase.	Galactose mutarotase catalyzes the first step in normal galactose metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of beta-D-galactose to alpha-D-galactose. The structure of the enzyme from Lactococcus lactis was recently solved in this laboratory and shown to be topologically similar to domain 5 of beta-galactosidase. From this initial X-ray analysis, four amino acid residues were demonstrated to be intimately involved in sugar binding to the protein: His 96, His 170, Asp 243, and Glu 304. Here we present a combined X-ray crystallographic and kinetic analysis designed to examine the role of these residues in the reaction mechanism of the enzyme. For this investigation, the following site-directed mutant proteins were prepared: H96N, H170N, D243N, D243A, E304Q, and E304A. All of the structures of these proteins, complexed with either glucose or galactose, were solved to a nominal resolution of 1.95 A or better, and their kinetic parameters were measured against D-galactose, D-glucose, L-arabinose, or D-xylose. From these studies, it can be concluded that Glu 304 and His 170 are critical for catalysis and that His 96 and Asp 243 are important for proper substrate positioning within the active site. Specifically, Glu 304 serves as the active site base to initiate the reaction by removing the proton from the C-1 hydroxyl group of the sugar substrate and His 170 functions as the active site acid to protonate the C-5 ring oxygen.

2026135	Crystal structure of haloalkane dehalogenase: an enzyme to detoxify halogenated alkanes.	Haloalkane dehalogenase from Xanthobacter autotrophicus GJ10 converts 1-haloalkanes to the corresponding alcohols and halide ions with water as the sole cosubstrate and without any need for oxygen or cofactors. The three-dimensional structure has been determined by multiple isomorphous replacement techniques using three heavy atom derivatives. The structure has been refined at 2.4 A resolution to an R-factor of 17.9%. The monomeric enzyme is a spherical molecule and is composed to two domains: domain I has an alpha/beta type structure with a central eight-stranded mainly parallel beta-sheet. Domain II lies like a cap on top of domain I and consists of alpha-helices connected by loops. Except for the cap domain the structure resembles that of the dienelactone hydrolase in spite of any significant sequence homology. The putative active site is completely buried in an internal hydrophobic cavity which is located between the two domains. From the analysis of the structure it is suggested that Asp124 is the nucleophilic residue essential for the catalysis. It interacts with His289 which is hydrogen-bonded to Asp260.

7857935	X-ray structure of cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase complexed with acarbose. Implications for the catalytic mechanism of glycosidases.	Crystals of cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase) from Bacillus circulans strain 251 were soaked in buffer solutions containing the pseudotetrasaccharide acarbose, a strong amylase- and CGTase inhibitor. The X-ray structure of the complex was elucidated at 2.5-A resolution with a final crystallographic R value of 15.8% for all data between 8.0 and 2.5 A. Acarbose is bound near the catalytic residues Asp229, Glu257, and Asp328. The carboxylic group of Glu257 is at hydrogen bonding distance from the glycosidic oxygen in the scissile bond between the B and C sugars (residue A is at the nonreducing end of the inhibitor). Asp328 makes hydrogen bonds with the 4-amino-4,6-dideoxyglucose (residue B), and Asp229 is in a close van der Waals contact with the C1 atom of this sugar. From this we conclude that in CGTase Glu257 acts as the proton donor and Asp229 serves as the general base or nucleophile, while Asp328 is involved in substrate binding and may be important for elevating the pKa of Glu257. On the basis of these results it appears that the absence of the C6-hydroxyl group in the B sugar is responsible for the inhibitory properties of acarbose on CGTase. This suggests that the C6-hydroxyl group of this sugar plays an essential role in the catalytic mechanism of CGTase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
10051558	Unexpected crucial role of residue 225 in serine proteases.	Residue 225 in serine proteases of the chymotrypsin family is Pro or Tyr in more than 95% of nearly 300 available sequences. Proteases with Y225 (like some blood coagulation and complement factors) are almost exclusively found in vertebrates, whereas proteases with P225 (like degradative enzymes) are present from bacteria to human. Saturation mutagenesis of Y225 in thrombin shows that residue 225 affects ligand recognition up to 60,000-fold. With the exception of Tyr and Phe, all residues are associated with comparable or greatly reduced catalytic activity relative to Pro. The crystal structures of three mutants that differ widely in catalytic activity (Y225F, Y225P, and Y225I) show that although residue 225 makes no contact with substrate, it drastically influences the shape of the water channel around the primary specificity site. The activity profiles obtained for thrombin also suggest that the conversion of Pro to Tyr or Phe documented in the vertebrates occurred through Ser and was driven by a significant gain (up to 50-fold) in catalytic activity. In fact, Ser and Phe are documented in 4% of serine proteases, which together with Pro and Tyr account for almost the entire distribution of residues at position 225. The unexpected crucial role of residue 225 in serine proteases explains the evolutionary selection of residues at this position and shows that the structural determinants of protease activity and specificity are more complex than currently believed. These findings have broad implications in the rational design of enzymes with enhanced catalytic properties.
12705909	Coral bleaching--how and why?	Bleaching refers to the loss of colour in symbioses between dinoflagellate algae of the genus Symbiodinium and marine benthic animals, e.g. corals. Bleaching generally results in depressed growth and increased mortality, and it can be considered as a deleterious physiological response or ailment. An explanatory framework for the causes of bleaching comprises three elements: the external factors or triggers of bleaching, e.g. elevated temperature; the symptoms, including elimination of algal cells and loss of algal pigment; and the mechanisms, which define the response of the symbiosis to the triggers, resulting in the observed symptoms. The extent to which bleaching in different symbioses and in response to different triggers involves common mechanisms is currently unknown, but a contribution of interactions between the algal and animal partners to bleaching is predicted. Symbioses vary in their susceptibility to bleaching as a result of genetic variation in Symbiodinium and acclimatory responses of the animal. The evolutionary explanation for bleaching is obscure. Perhaps, bleaching was of selective advantage to the animal hosts under different (more benign?) environmental conditions than the present, or bleaching may be a negative by-product of an otherwise advantageous symbiotic trait, such as the elimination of damaged algal cells.
7473717	Structural studies on human rhinovirus 14 drug-resistant compensation mutants.	Structures have been determined of three human rhinovirus 14 (HRV14) compensation mutants that have resistance to the antiviral capsid binding compounds WIN 52035 and WIN 52084. In addition, the structure of HRV14 is reported, with a site-directed mutation at residue 1219 in VP1. A spontaneous mutation occurs at the same site in one of the compensation mutants. Some of the mutations are on the viral surface in the canyon and some lie within the hydrophobic binding pocket in VP1 below the ICAM footprint. Those mutant virus strains with mutations on the surface bind better to cells than does wild-type virus. The antiviral compounds bind to the mutant viruses in a manner similar to their binding to wild-type virus. The receptor and WIN compound binding sites overlap, causing competition between receptor attachment and antiviral compound binding. The compensation mutants probably function by shifting the equilibrium in favor of receptor binding. The mutations in the canyon increase the affinity of the virus for the receptor, while the mutations in the pocket probably decrease the affinity of the WIN compounds for the virus by reducing favorable hydrophobic contacts and constricting the pore through which the antiviral compounds are thought to enter the pocket. This is in contrast to the resistant exclusion mutants that block compounds from binding by increasing the bulk of residues within the hydrophobic pocket in VP1.
12904027	Structural aspects for evolution of beta-lactamases from penicillin-binding proteins.	Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), biosynthetic enzymes of bacterial cell wall assembly, and beta-lactamases, resistance enzymes to beta-lactam antibiotics, are related to each other from an evolutionary point of view. Massova and Mobashery (Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998, 42, 1-17) have proposed that for beta-lactamases to have become effective at their function as antibiotic resistance enzymes, they would have had to undergo structure alterations such that they would not interact with the peptidoglycan, which is the substrate for PBPs. A cephalosporin analogue, 7beta-[N-Acetyl-L-alanyl-gamma-D-glutamyl-L-lysine]-3-acetoxymethyl-3-cephem-carboxylic acid (compound 6), was conceived and synthesized to test this notion. The X-ray structure of the complex of this cephalosporin bound to the active site of the deacylation-deficient Q120L/Y150E variant of the class C AmpC beta-lactamase from Escherichia coli was solved at 1.71 A resolution. This complex revealed that the surface for interaction with the strand of peptidoglycan that acylates the active site, which is present in PBPs, is absent in the -lactamase active site. Furthermore, insertion of a peptide in the beta-lactamase active site at a location where the second strand of peptidoglycan in some PBPs binds has effectively abolished the possibility for such interaction with the beta-lactamase. A 2.6 ns dynamics simulation was carried out for the complex, which revealed that the peptidoglycan surrogate (i.e., the active-site-bound ligand) undergoes substantial motion and is not stabilized for binding within the active site. These factors taken together disclose the set of structure modifications in the antibiotic resistance enzyme that prevent it from interacting with the peptidoglycan, en route to achieving catalytic proficiency for their intended function.
10556244	Contribution of amino acid substitutions at two different interior positions to the conformational stability of human lysozyme.	To elucidate correlative relationships between structural change and thermodynamic stability in proteins, a series of mutant human lysozymes modified at two buried positions (Ile56 and Ile59) were examined. Their thermodynamic parameters of denaturation and crystal structures were studied by calorimetry and X-ray crystallography. The mutants at positions 56 and 59 exhibited different responses to a series of amino acid substitutions. The changes in stability due to substitutions showed a linear correlation with changes in hydrophobicity of substituted residues, having different slopes at each mutation site. However, the stability of each mutant was found to be represented by a unique equation involving physical properties calculated from mutant structures. By fitting present and previous stability data for mutant human lysozymes substituted at various positions to the equation, the magnitudes of the hydrophobicity of a carbon atom and the hydrophobicity of nitrogen and neutral oxygen atoms were found to be 0.178 and -0.013 kJ/mol.A(2), respectively. It was also found that the contribution of a hydrogen bond with a length of 3.0 A to protein stability was 5.1 kJ/mol and the entropy loss of newly introduction of a water molecules was 7.8 kJ/mol.
8634253	An engineered cation site in cytochrome c peroxidase alters the reactivity of the redox active tryptophan.	The crystal structures of cytochrome c peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase are very similar, including the active site architecture. Both peroxidases have a tryptophan residue, designated the proximal Trp, located directly adjacent to the proximal histidine heme ligand. During the catalytic cycle, the proximal Trp in cytochrome c peroxidase is oxidized to a cation radical. However, in ascorbate peroxidase, the porphyrin is oxidized, not the proximal Trp, despite the close similarity between the two peroxidase active site structures. A cation located approximately 8 A from the proximal Trp in ascorbate peroxidase but absent in cytochrome c peroxidase is thought to be one reason why ascorbate peroxidase does not form a Trp radical. Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to introduce the ascorbate peroxidase cation binding site into cytochrome c peroxidase. Crystal structures show that mutants now bind a cation. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy shows that the cation-containing mutants of cytochrome c peroxidase no longer form a stable Trp radical. The activity of the cation mutants using ferrocytochrome c as a substrate is < 1% of wild type levels, while the activity toward a small molecule substrate, guaiacol, increases. These results demonstrate that long range electrostatic effects can control the reactivity of a redox active amino acid side chain and that oxidation/reduction of the proximal Trp is important in the oxidation of ferrocytochrome c.
7890671	Crystal structures of recombinant rat cathepsin B and a cathepsin B-inhibitor complex. Implications for structure-based inhibitor design.	The lysosomal cysteine proteinase cathepsin B (EC 3.4.22.1) plays an important role in protein catabolism and has also been implicated in various disease states. The crystal structures of two forms of native recombinant rat cathepsin B have been determined. The overall folding of rat cathepsin B was shown to be very similar to that of the human liver enzyme. The structure of the native enzyme containing an underivatized active site cysteine (Cys29) showed the active enzyme conformation to be similar to that determined previously for the oxidized form. In a second structure Cys29 was derivatized with the reversible blocking reagent pyridyl disulfide. In this structure large side chain conformational changes were observed for the two key catalytic residues Cys29 and His199, demonstrating the potential flexibility of these side chains. In addition the structure of the complex between rat cathepsin B and the inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Arg-Ser(O-Bzl) chloromethylketone was determined. The complex structure showed that very little conformational change occurs in the enzyme upon inhibitor binding. It also allowed visualization of the interaction between the enzyme and inhibitor. In particular the interaction between Glu245 and the P2 Arg residue was clearly demonstrated, and it was found that the benzyl group of the P1 substrate residue occupies a large hydrophobic pocket thought to represent the S'1 subsite. This may have important implications for structure-based design of cathepsin B inhibitors.
7626635	Crystal structure of a D-amino acid aminotransferase: how the protein controls stereoselectivity.	The three-dimensional structure of D-amino acid aminotransferase (D-AAT) in the pyridoxamine phosphate form has been determined crystallographically. The fold of this pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-containing enzyme is completely different from those of any of the other enzymes that utilize PLP as part of their mechanism and whose structures are known. However, there are some striking similarities between the active sites of D-AAT and the corresponding enzyme that transaminates L-amino acids, L-aspartate aminotransferase. These similarities represent convergent evolution to a common solution of the problem of enforcing transamination chemistry on the PLP cofactor. Implications of these similarities are discussed in terms of their possible roles in the stabilization of intermediates of a transamination reaction. In addition, sequence similarity between D-AAT and branched chain L-amino acid aminotransferase suggests that this latter enzyme will also have a fold similar to that of D-AAT.
15242603	Crystal structure of activated HutP; an RNA binding protein that regulates transcription of the hut operon in Bacillus subtilis.	HutP is an L-histidine-activated RNA binding protein that regulates the expression of the histidine utilization (hut) operon in Bacillus subtilis by binding to cis-acting regulatory sequences on the hut mRNA. The crystal structure of HutP complexed with an L-histidine analog showed a novel fold; there are four antiparallel beta strands in the central region of each monomer, with two alpha helices each on the front and back. Two HutP monomers form a dimer, and three dimers are arranged in crystallographic 3-fold symmetry to form a hexamer. A histidine analog was located in between the two monomers of HutP, with the imidazole group of L-histidine hydrogen bonded to Glu81. An activation mechanism is proposed based on the identification of key residues of HutP. The HutP binding region in hut mRNA was defined: it consists of three UAG trinucleotide motifs separated by four spacer nucleotides. Residues of HutP potentially important for RNA binding were identified.
8918883	Structural basis for the binding of a globular antifreeze protein to ice.	Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) have the unique ability to adsorb to ice and inhibit its growth. Many organisms ranging from fish to bacteria use AFPs to retard freezing or lessen the damage incurred upon freezing and thawing. The ice-binding mechanism of the long linear alpha-helical type I AFPs has been attributed to their regularly spaced polar residues matching the ice lattice along a pyramidal plane. In contrast, it is not known how globular antifreeze proteins such as type III AFP that lack repeating ice-binding residues bind to ice. Here we report the 1.25 A crystal structure of recombinant type III AFP (QAE isoform) from eel pout (Macrozoarces americanus), which reveals a remarkably flat amphipathic ice-binding site where five hydrogen-bonding atoms match two ranks of oxygens on the [1010] ice prism plane in the <0001> direction, giving high ice-binding affinity and specificity. This binding site, substantiated by the structures and properties of several ice-binding site mutants, suggests that the AFP occupies a niche in the ice surface in which it covers the basal plane while binding to the prism face.
11279193	Molecular basis for severe epimerase deficiency galactosemia. X-ray structure of the human V94m-substituted UDP-galactose 4-epimerase.	Galactosemia is an inherited disorder characterized by an inability to metabolize galactose. Although classical galactosemia results from impairment of the second enzyme of the Leloir pathway, namely galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, alternate forms of the disorder can occur due to either galactokinase or UDP-galactose 4-epimerase deficiencies. One of the more severe cases of epimerase deficiency galactosemia arises from an amino acid substitution at position 94. It has been previously demonstrated that the V94M protein is impaired relative to the wild-type enzyme predominantly at the level of V(max) rather than K(m). To address the molecular consequences the mutation imparts on the three-dimensional architecture of the enzyme, we have solved the structures of the V94M-substituted human epimerase complexed with NADH and UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, UDP-GlcNAc, or UDP-GalNAc. In the wild-type enzyme, the hydrophobic side chain of Val(94) packs near the aromatic group of the catalytic Tyr(157) and serves as a molecular "fence" to limit the rotation of the glycosyl portions of the UDP-sugar substrates within the active site. The net effect of the V94M substitution is an opening up of the Ala(93) to Glu(96) surface loop, which allows free rotation of the sugars into nonproductive binding modes.
11781092	Two glutamate residues, Glu 208 alpha and Glu 197 beta, are crucial for phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the active-site histidine residue in succinyl-CoA synthetase.	Succinyl-CoA synthetase catalyzes the reversible reaction succinyl-CoA + NDP + P(i) <--> succinate + CoA + NTP (N denoting adenosine or guanosine). The enzyme consists of two different subunits, designated alpha and beta. During the reaction, a histidine residue of the alpha-subunit is transiently phosphorylated. This histidine residue interacts with Glu 208 alpha at site I in the structures of phosphorylated and dephosphorylated Escherichia coli SCS. We postulated that Glu 197 beta, a residue in the nucleotide-binding domain, would provide similar stabilization of the histidine residue during the actual phosphorylation/dephosphorylation by nucleotide at site II. In this work, these two glutamate residues have been mutated individually to aspartate or glutamine. Glu 197 beta has been additionally mutated to alanine. The mutant proteins were tested for their ability to be phosphorylated in the forward or reverse direction. The aspartate mutant proteins can be phosphorylated in either direction, while the E208 alpha Q mutant protein can only be phosphorylated by NTP, and the E197 beta Q mutant protein can only be phosphorylated by succinyl-CoA and P(i). These results demonstrate that the length of the side chain at these positions is not critical, but that the charge is. Most significantly, the E197 beta A mutant protein could not be phosphorylated in either direction. Its crystal structure shows large differences from the wild-type enzyme in the conformation of two residues of the alpha-subunit, Cys 123 alpha-Pro 124 alpha. We postulate that in this conformation, the protein cannot productively bind succinyl-CoA for phosphorylation via succinyl-CoA and P(i).
12939145	Molecular engineering of myoglobin: influence of residue 68 on the rate and the enantioselectivity of oxidation reactions catalyzed by H64D/V68X myoglobin.	In the elucidation of structural requirements of heme vicinity for hydrogen peroxide activation, we found that the replacement of His-64 of myoglobin (Mb) with a negatively charged aspartate residue enhanced peroxidase and peroxygenase activities by 78- and 580-fold, respectively. Since residue 68 is known to influence the ligation of small molecules to the heme iron, we constructed H64D/V68X Mb bearing Ala, Ser, Leu, Ile, and Phe at position 68 to improve the oxidation activity. The Val-68 to Leu mutation of H64D Mb accelerates the reaction with H(2)O(2) to form a catalytic species, called compound I, and improves the one-electron oxidation of 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) (i.e., peroxidase activity) approximately 2-fold. On the other hand, H64D/V68I Mb oxygenates thioanisole 2.7- and 1600-fold faster than H64D and wild-type Mb, respectively. In terms of the enantioselectivity, H64D/V68A and H64D/V68S Mb were good chiral catalysts for thioanisole oxidation and produced the (R)-sulfoxide dominantly with 84% and 88% ee, respectively [Kato, S., et al. (2002) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 124, 8506-8507]. On the contrary, the substitution of Val-68 in H64D Mb with an isoleucine residue alters the dominant sulfoxide product from the (R)- to the (S)-isomer. The crystal structures of H64D/V68A and H64D/V68S Mb elucidated in this study do not clearly indicate residues interacting with thioanisole. However, comparison of the active site structures provides the basis to interpret the changes in oxidation activity: (1) direct steric interactions between residue 68 and substrates (i.e., H(2)O(2), ABTS, thioanisole) and (2) the polar interactions between tightly hydrogen-bonded water molecules and substrates.
8038153	Structural characteristics for biological activity of heat-stable enterotoxin produced by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli: X-ray crystallography of weakly toxic and nontoxic analogs.	Heat-stable enterotoxin (ST) produced by a pathogenic strain of Escherichia coli exerts its function by binding to a membrane-bound guanylyl cyclase on intestinal epithelial cell membranes, which in turn catalyzes the production of cyclic GMP as a second messenger in the cells. To elucidate the structural requirements for the biological activities of ST, we synthesized [Mpr5,Gly13]STp(5-17) and [Mpr5,Leu13]STp(5-17), which are weakly toxic and nontoxic analogs of STp, in which the toxic domain consists of the sequence from Cys at position 5 to Cys at position 17. In these analogs, Cys at position 5 is replaced by Mpr (beta-mercaptopropionic acid) and Ala at position 13 by Gly and Leu, respectively. We examined these analogs by X-ray diffraction analysis using direct methods and refined the structures to crystallographic R factors of 7.3% and 6.6% using 5492 and 5122 data, respectively, observed > 3 sigma (Fo) with a resolution of 0.89 A. These peptides have a right-handed spiral structure consisting of three structural segments: an N-terminal 3(10) helix, a central type I beta-turn, and a C-terminal type II beta-turn. These structures show minor differences from that of [Mpr5]STp(5-17), the fully toxic analog of heat-stable enterotoxin [Ozaki et al. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 5934-5941], suggesting that the decrease and loss of the biological activities of [Mpr5,Gly13]STp(5-17) and [Mpr5,Leu13]STp(5-17), respectively, are not caused by structural changes but are associated with the direct interaction of Ala13 with the receptor protein. Careful comparison of these structures in crystalline states revealed that ST has the following structural characteristics: (i) inherent flexibility at the junctions of the three segments and in the central segment, which includes the putative receptor-binding residues, Ala13, (ii) a specific hydrophobic character around the central segment, and (iii) an unexpected C-terminal folding similar to those of functionally unrelated peptides that are known to be ionophores.
8535785	The structure of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase complexed with 9-chloro-TIBO: lessons for inhibitor design.	BACKGROUND: HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) is a key target of anti-AIDS therapies. Structural studies of HIV-1 RT, unliganded and complexed with different non-nucleoside inhibitors (NNIs), have pointed to a common mode of binding and inactivation through distortion of the polymerase catalytic site by NNIs containing two hinged rings. The mode of binding of the TIBO family of inhibitors is of interest because these compounds do not fit the two-hinged-ring model. RESULTS: The structure of HIV-1 RT complexed with 9-chloro-TIBO (R82913) has been determined at 2.6 A resolution. As reported for the lower resolution analysis of another TIBO compound, this inhibitor binds at the same site as other NNIs, but our higher resolution study reveals the Cl-TIBO is distorted from the conformation seen in crystals of the inhibitor alone. This allows Cl-TIBO to mimic the binding of NNIs containing two hinged rings. Inhibitor-protein interactions are again predominantly hydrophobic and the protein conformation corresponds to that seen in complexes with other tight-binding NNIs. CONCLUSIONS: Although Cl-TIBO is chemically very different from other NNIs, it achieves remarkable spatial equivalence and shape complementarity with other NNIs on binding to RT. Comparison of the different RT-NNI complexes suggests modifications to the TIBO group of inhibitors which might enhance their binding and hence, potentially, their therapeutic efficacy.
12368900	The catalytic mechanism of the ESA1 histone acetyltransferase involves a self-acetylated intermediate.	Yeast ESA1 is a member of the MYST subfamily of histone acetyltransferases (HATs), which use acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) to acetylate specific Lys residues within histones to regulate gene expression. The structure of an ESA1-CoA complex reveals structural similarity to the catalytic core of the GCN5/PCAF subfamily of HAT proteins. Here we report additional structural and functional studies on ESA1 that demonstrate that histone acetylation proceeds through an acetyl-cysteine enzyme intermediate. This Cys residue is strictly conserved within the MYST members, suggesting a common mode of catalysis by this HAT subfamily. However, this mode of catalysis differs dramatically from the GCN5/PCAF subfamily, which mediate direct nucleophilic attack of the acetyl-CoA cofactor by the enzyme-deprotonated substrate lysine of the histone. These results demonstrate that different HAT subfamilies can use distinct catalytic mechanisms, which have implications for their distinct biological roles and for the development of HAT-specific inhibitors.
11467966	Crystal structures of amylosucrase from Neisseria polysaccharea in complex with D-glucose and the active site mutant Glu328Gln in complex with the natural substrate sucrose.	The structure of amylosucrase from Neisseria polysaccharea in complex with beta-D-glucose has been determined by X-ray crystallography at a resolution of 1.66 A. Additionally, the structure of the inactive active site mutant Glu328Gln in complex with sucrose has been determined to a resolution of 2.0 A. The D-glucose complex shows two well-defined D-glucose molecules, one that binds very strongly in the bottom of a pocket that contains the proposed catalytic residues (at the subsite -1), in a nonstrained (4)C(1) conformation, and one that binds in the packing interface to a symmetry-related molecule. A third weaker D-glucose-binding site is located at the surface near the active site pocket entrance. The orientation of the D-glucose in the active site emphasizes the Glu328 role as the general acid/base. The binary sucrose complex shows one molecule bound in the active site, where the glucosyl moiety is located at the alpha-amylase -1 position and the fructosyl ring occupies subsite +1. Sucrose effectively blocks the only visible access channel to the active site. From analysis of the complex it appears that sucrose binding is primarily obtained through enzyme interactions with the glucosyl ring and that an important part of the enzyme function is a precise alignment of a lone pair of the linking O1 oxygen for hydrogen bond interaction with Glu328. The sucrose specificity appears to be determined primarily by residues Asp144, Asp394, Arg446, and Arg509. Both Asp394 and Arg446 are located in an insert connecting beta-strand 7 and alpha-helix 7 that is much longer in amylosucrase compared to other enzymes from the alpha-amylase family (family 13 of the glycoside hydrolases).
11061974	A snapshot of a transition state analogue of a novel thermophilic esterase belonging to the subfamily of mammalian hormone-sensitive lipase.	EST2 is a novel thermophilic carboxylesterase, isolated and cloned from Alicyclobacillus (formerly Bacillus) acidocaldarius, which optimally hydrolyses esters with acyl chain lengths of six to eight carbon atoms at 70 degrees C. On the basis of the amino acid sequence homology, it has been classified as a member of the mammalian hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) subfamily.The crystal structure of EST2, complexed with a sulphonyl derivative, has been determined at 2.6 A resolution by a multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction experiment on a seleno-methionine derivative. EST2 presents a canonical alpha/beta hydrolase core, shielded at the C-terminal side by a cap region built up of five helices. It contains the lipase-like catalytic triad, Ser155, His282 and Asp252, whereby the nucleophile is covalently modified. This allows an unambiguous view of the putative active site of EST2, detecting the oxyanion hole, in whose formation the amino acid sequence motif His81-Gly82-Gly83-Gly84 is involved, and the hydrophobic binding pocket for the acyl chain. The structural model here reported provides the first example of a transition state analogue of an esterase/lipase belonging to the HSL group, thus affording useful information for the design of medical inhibitors. Moreover, as the first X-ray structure of a thermophilic carboxylesterase, the comparison with its mesophilic homologue, the Brefeldin A esterase (BFAE) from Bacillus subtilis, allows the identification of putative determinants of thermal stability.
11080630	Structural basis for the resilience of efavirenz (DMP-266) to drug resistance mutations in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase.	BACKGROUND: Efavirenz is a second-generation non-nucleoside inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) that has recently been approved for use against HIV-1 infection. Compared with first-generation drugs such as nevirapine, efavirenz shows greater resilience to drug resistance mutations within HIV-1 RT. In order to understand the basis for this resilience at the molecular level and to help the design of further-improved anti-AIDS drugs, we have determined crystal structures of efavirenz and nevirapine with wild-type RT and the clinically important K103N mutant. RESULTS: The relatively compact efavirenz molecule binds, as expected, within the non-nucleoside inhibitor binding pocket of RT. There are significant rearrangements of the drug binding site within the mutant RT compared with the wild-type enzyme. These changes, which lead to the repositioning of the inhibitor, are not seen in the interaction with the first-generation drug nevirapine. CONCLUSIONS: The repositioning of efavirenz within the drug binding pocket of the mutant RT, together with conformational rearrangements in the protein, could represent a general mechanism whereby certain second-generation non-nucleoside inhibitors are able to reduce the effect of drug-resistance mutations on binding potency.
8396120	Sequencing and characterization of a gene cluster encoding the enzymes for L-rhamnose metabolism in Escherichia coli.	The sequencing of the EcoRI-HindIII fragment complementing mutations in the structural genes of the L-rhamnose regulon of Escherichia coli has permitted identification of the open reading frames corresponding to rhaB, rhaA, and rhaD. The deduced amino acid sequences gave a 425-amino-acid polypeptide corresponding to rhamnulose kinase for rhaB, a 400-amino-acid polypeptide corresponding to rhamnose isomerase for rhaA, and a 274-amino-acid polypeptide corresponding to rhamnulose-1-phosphate aldolase for rhaD. Transcriptional fusions of the three putative promoter regions to lacZ showed that only the rhaB leader region acted as a promoter, as indicated by the high beta-galactosidase activity induced by rhamnose, while no significant activity from the rhaA and rhaD constructions was detected. The rhaB transcription start site was mapped to -24 relative to the start of translation. Mutations in the catabolic genes were used to show that L-rhamnose may directly induce rhaBAD transcription.
7885471	Structural basis of cell-cell adhesion by cadherins.	Crystal structures of the amino-terminal domain of N-cadherin provide a picture at the atomic level of a specific adhesive contact between cells. A repeated set of dimer interfaces is common to the structure in three lattices. These interactions combine to form a linear zipper of molecules that mirrors the linear structure of the intracellular filaments with which cadherins associate. This cell-adhesion zipper may provide a mechanism to marshal individual molecular adhesive interactions into strong bonds between cells.
3107125	Bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics: crystal structure of beta-lactamase from Staphylococcus aureus PC1 at 2.5 A resolution.	beta-lactamases are enzymes that protect bacteria from the lethal effects of beta-lactam antibiotics, and are therefore of considerable clinical importance. The crystal structure of beta-lactamase from the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus PC1 has been determined at 2.5 angstrom resolution. It reveals a molecule of novel topology, made up of two closely associated domains. The active site is located at the interface between the domains, with the key catalytic residue Ser70 at the amino terminus of a buried helix. Examination of the disposition of the functionally important residues within the active site depression leads to a model for the binding of a substrate and a functional analogy to the serine proteases. The unusual topology of the secondary structure units is relevant to questions concerning the evolutionary relation to the beta-lactam target enzymes of the bacterial cell wall.
9341204	Site-directed mutants of pseudoazurin: explanation of increased redox potentials from X-ray structures and from calculation of redox potential differences.	In order to understand the origins of differences in redox potentials among cupredoxins (small blue type I copper-containing proteins that reversibly change oxidation state and interact with redox partners), we have determined the structures of the native and two mutants (P80A and P80I) of pseudoazurin from Alcaligenes faecalis S-6 in oxidized and reduced forms at resolutions of 2.2 A in the worst case and 1.6 A in the best case. The P80A mutation creates a surface pocket filled by a new water molecule, whereas the P80I mutant excludes this water. Distinct patterns of change occur in response to reduction for all three molecules: the copper position shifts, Met 7 and Pro 35 move, and the relative orientations of residues 81 to 16, 18 to the amide planes of 77 and 86, all change. Systematic changes in the weak electrostatic interactions seen in the structures of different oxidation states can explain the Met 7/Pro 35 structural differences as well as some fluctuating solvent positions. Overall displacement parameters increase reversibly upon reduction. The reduced forms are slightly expanded over the oxidized forms. The geometries of the mutants become more trigonal in their reduced forms, consistent with higher redox potentials (+409 mV for P80A and +450 mV for P80I). Calculations of the differences in redox potentials, using POLARIS, reveal that a water unique to the P80A mutant is required (with correctly oriented hydrogens) to approximate the observed difference in redox potential. The POLARIS calculations suggest that the reduced forms are additionally stabilized through changes in the solvation of the copper center, specifically via the amides of residues 16, 39, 41, 79, and 80 which interact with either Phe 18, Met 86, or Cys 78. The redox potential of P80A is increased largely due to solvation effects, whereas the redox potential of P80I is increased largely due to geometrical effects.
9063874	Control of oxidation-reduction potentials in flavodoxin from Clostridium beijerinckii: the role of conformation changes.	X-ray analyses of wild-type and mutant flavodoxins from Clostridium beijerinckii show that the conformation of the peptide Gly57-Asp58, in a bend near the isoalloxazine ring of FMN, is correlated with the oxidation state of the FMN prosthetic group. The Gly-Asp peptide may adopt any of three conformations: trans O-up, in which the carbonyl oxygen of Gly57 (O57) points toward the flavin ring; trans O-down, in which O57 points away from the flavin; and cis O-down. Interconversions among these conformers that are linked to oxidation-reduction of the flavin can modulate the redox potentials of bound FMN. In the semiquinone and reduced forms of the protein, the Gly57-Asp58 peptide adopts the trans O-up conformation and accepts a hydrogen bond from the flavin N5H [Smith, W. W., Burnett, R. M., Darling, G. D., & Ludwig, M. L. (1977) J. Mol. Biol. 117, 195-225; Ludwig, M. L., & Luschinsky, C. L. (1992) in Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes III (M|ller, F., Ed.) pp 427-466, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL]. Analyses reported in this paper confirm that, in crystals of wild-type oxidized C. beijerinckii flavodoxin, the Gly57-Asp58 peptide adopts the O-down orientation and isomerizes to the cis conformation. This cis form is preferentially stabilized in the crystals by intermolecular hydrogen bonding to Asn137. Structures for the mutant Asn137Ala indicate that a mixture of all three conformers, mostly O-down, exists in oxidized C. beijerinckii flavodoxin in the absence of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Redox potentials have been manipulated by substitutions that alter the conformational energies of the bend at 56M-G-D-E. The mutation Asp58Pro was constructed to study a case where energies for cis-trans conversion would be different from that of wild type. Intermolecular interactions with Asn137 are precluded in the crystal, yet Gly57-Pro58 is cis, and O-down, when the flavin is oxidized. Reduction of the flavin induces rearrangement to the trans O-up conformation. Redox potential shifts reflect the altered energies associated with the peptide rearrangement; E(ox/sq) decreases by approximately 60 mV (1.3 kcal/mol). Further, the results of mutation of Gly57 agree with predictions that a side chain at residue 57 should make addition of the first electron more difficult, by raising the energy of the O-up conformer that forms when the flavin is reduced to its semiquinone state. The ox/sq potentials in the mutants Gly57Ala, Gly57Asn, and Gly57Asp are all decreased by approximately 60 mV (1.3 kcal/mol). Introduction of the beta-branched threonine side chain at position 57 has much larger effects on the conformations and potentials. The Thr57-Asp58 peptide adopts a trans O-down conformation when the flavin is oxidized; upon reduction to the semiquinone, the 57-58 peptide rotates to a trans O-up conformation resembling that found in the wild-type protein. Changes in FMN-protein interactions and in conformational equilibria in G57T combine to decrease the redox potential for the ox/sq equilibrium by 180 mV (+4.0 kcal/mol) and to increase the sq/hq potential by 80 mV (-1.7 kcal/mol). A thermodynamic scheme is introduced as a framework for rationalizing the properties of wild-type flavodoxin and the effects of the mutations.
1409567	Crystal structure of the reduced form of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase refined at 2.3 A resolution.	The crystal structure of the reduced form of the enzyme p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase from Pseudomonas fluorescens, complexed with its substrate p-hydroxybenzoate, has been obtained by protein X-ray crystallography. Crystals of the reduced form were prepared by soaking crystals of the oxidized enzyme-substrate complex in deaerated mother liquor containing 300-400 mM NADPH. A rapid bleaching of the crystals indicated the reduction of the enzyme-bound FAD by NADPH. This was confirmed by single crystal spectroscopy. X-ray data to 2.3 A were collected on oscillation films using a rotating anode generator as an X-ray source. After data processing and reduction, restrained least squares refinement using the 1.9 A structure of the oxidized enzyme-substrate complex as a starting model, yielded a crystallographic R-factor of 14.8% for 11,394 reflections. The final model of the reduced complex contains 3,098 protein atoms, the FAD molecule, the substrate p-hydroxybenzoate and 322 solvent molecules. The structures of the oxidized and reduced forms of the enzyme-substrate complex were found to be very similar. The root-mean-square discrepancy for all atoms between both structures was 0.38 A. The flavin ring is almost completely planar in the final model, although it was allowed to bend or twist during refinement. The observed angle between the benzene and the pyrimidine ring is 2 degrees. This value should be compared with observed values of 10 degrees for the oxidized enzyme-substrate complex and 19 degrees for the enzyme-product complex. The position of the substrate is virtually unaltered with respect to its position in the oxidized enzyme. No trace of a bound NADP+ or NADPH molecule was found.
11844799	Crystal structure of argininosuccinate synthetase from Thermus thermophilus HB8. Structural basis for the catalytic action.	Argininosuccinate synthetase catalyzes the ATP-dependent condensation of a citrulline with an aspartate to give argininosuccinate. The three-dimensional structures of the enzyme from Thermus thermophilus HB8 in its free form, complexed with intact ATP, and complexed with an ATP analogue (adenylyl imidodiphosphate) and substrate analogues (arginine and succinate) have been determined at 2.3-, 2.3-, and 1.95-A resolution, respectively. The structure is essentially the same as that of the Escherichia coli argininosuccinate synthetase. The small domain has the same fold as that of a new family of "N-type" ATP pyrophosphatases with the P-loop specific for the pyrophosphate of ATP. However, the enzyme shows the P-loop specific for the gamma-phosphate of ATP. The structure of the complex form is quite similar to that of the native one, indicating that no conformational change occurs upon the binding of ATP and the substrate analogues. ATP and the substrate analogues are bound to the active site with their reaction sites close to one another and located in a geometrical orientation favorable to the catalytic action. The reaction mechanism so far proposed seems to be consistent with the locations of ATP and the substrate analogues. The reaction may proceed without the large conformational change of the enzyme proposed for the catalytic process.
15647363	Prion protein NMR structures of elk and of mouse/elk hybrids.	The NMR structure of the recombinant elk prion protein (ePrP), which represents the cellular isoform (ePrPC) in the healthy organism, is described here. As anticipated from the highly conserved amino acid sequence, ePrPC has the same global fold as other mammalian prion proteins (PrPs), with a flexibly disordered "tail" of residues 23-124 and a globular domain 125-226 with three alpha-helices and a short antiparallel beta-sheet. However, ePrPC shows a striking local structure variation when compared with most other mammalian PrPs, in particular human, bovine, and mouse PrPC. A loop of residues 166-175, which links the beta-sheet with the alpha2-helix and is part of a hypothetical "protein X" epitope, is outstandingly well defined, whereas this loop is disordered in the other species. Based on NMR structure determinations of two mouse PrP variants, mPrP[N174T] and mPrP[S170N,N174T], this study shows that the structured loop in ePrPC relates to these two local amino acid exchanges, so that mPrP[S170N,N174T] exactly mimics ePrPC. These results are evaluated in the context of recent reports on chronic wasting disease (CWD) in captive and free-ranging deer and elk in the U.S. and Canada, and an animal model is proposed for support of future research on CWD.
11477222	Tolerance of point substitution of methionine for isoleucine in hen egg white lysozyme.	X-ray structure determination of proteins by using the multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion method targeting selenomethionine is now widely employed. Isoleucine was examined for the second choice of the substitution of methionine next to leucine. We performed a systematic mutational study of the substitutions of methionine for isoleucine. All mutated lysozymes were less stable than the wild-type by about 1 kcal/mol and it is suggested that this instability was caused by the change in residual hydrophobicity from isoleucine to methionine. The X-ray structures of all mutant lysozymes were very similar to that of the wild-type. In addition, both the accessible surface areas and the conformation of the side chain of methionine in all mutant lysozymes were similar to those of the side chain at the respective isoleucine in the wild-type. Therefore, it is suggested that the mutation from isoleucine to methionine in a protein can be considered as a "safe" substitution.
16285725	Exploring the binding conformations of bulkier dipeptide amide inhibitors in constitutive nitric oxide synthases.	A series of L-nitroarginine-based dipeptide inhibitors are highly selective for neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) over the endothelial isoform (eNOS). Crystal structures of these dipeptides bound to both isoforms revealed two different conformations, curled in nNOS and extended in eNOS, corresponding to higher and lower binding affinity to the two isoforms, respectively. In previous studies we found that the primary reason for selectivity is that Asp597 in nNOS, which is Asn368 in eNOS, provides greater electrostatic stabilization in the inhibitor complex. While this is the case for smaller dipeptide inhibitors, electrostatic stabilization may no longer be the sole determinant for isoform selectivity with bulkier dipeptide inhibitors. Another residue farther away from the active site, Met336 in nNOS (Val106 in eNOS), is in contact with bulkier dipeptide inhibitors. Double mutants were made to exchange the D597/M336 pair in nNOS with N368/V106 in eNOS. Here we report crystal structures and inhibition constants for bulkier dipeptide inhibitors bound to nNOS and eNOS that illustrate the important role played by residues near the entry to the active site in isoform selective inhibition.
12433916	High resolution crystal structures of human Rab5a and five mutants with substitutions in the catalytically important phosphate-binding loop.	GTPase domain crystal structures of Rab5a wild type and five variants with mutations in the phosphate-binding loop are reported here at resolutions up to 1.5 A. Of particular interest, the A30P mutant was crystallized in complexes with GDP, GDP+AlF(3), and authentic GTP, respectively. The other variant crystals were obtained in complexes with a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog, GppNHp. All structures were solved in the same crystal form, providing an unusual opportunity to compare structures of small GTPases with different catalytic rates. The A30P mutant exhibits dramatically reduced GTPase activity and forms a GTP-bound complex stable enough for crystallographic analysis. Importantly, the A30P structure with bound GDP plus AlF(3) has been solved in the absence of a GTPase-activating protein, and it may resemble that of a transition state intermediate. Conformational changes are observed between the GTP-bound form and the transition state intermediate, mainly in the switch II region containing the catalytic Gln(79) residue and independent of A30P mutation-induced local alterations in the P-loop. The structures suggest an important catalytic role for a P-loop backbone amide group, which is eliminated in the A30P mutant, and support the notion that the transition state of GTPase-mediated GTP hydrolysis is of considerable dissociative character.
14500716	Involvement of the pyrophosphate and the 2'-phosphate binding regions of ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase in coenzyme specificity.	Previous studies indicated that the determinants of coenzyme specificity in ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR) from Anabaena are situated in the 2'-phosphate (2'-P) NADP+ binding region, and also suggested that other regions must undergo structural rearrangements of the protein backbone during coenzyme binding. Among the residues involved in such specificity could be those located in regions where interaction with the pyrophosphate group of the coenzyme takes place, namely loops 155-160 and 261-268 in Anabaena FNR. In order to learn more about the coenzyme specificity determinants, and to better define the structural basis of coenzyme binding, mutations in the pyrophosphate and 2'-P binding regions of FNR have been introduced. Modification of the pyrophosphate binding region, involving residues Thr-155, Ala-160, and Leu-263, indicates that this region is involved in determining coenzyme specificity and that selected alterations of these positions produce FNR enzymes that are able to bind NAD+. Thus, our results suggest that slightly different structural rearrangements of the backbone chain in the pyrophosphate binding region might determine FNR specificity for the coenzyme. Combined mutations at the 2'-P binding region, involving residues Ser-223, Arg-224, Arg-233, and Tyr-235, in combination with the residues mentioned above in the pyrophosphate binding region have also been carried out in an attempt to increase the FNR affinity for NAD+/H. However, in most cases the analyzed mutants lost the ability for NADP+/H binding and electron transfer, and no major improvements were observed with regard to the efficiency of the reactions with NAD+/H. Therefore, our results confirm that determinants for coenzyme specificity in FNR are also situated in the pyrophosphate binding region and not only in the 2'-P binding region. Such observations also suggest that other regions of the protein, yet to be identified, might also be involved in this process.
10206894	Crystal structure of human ZAG, a fat-depleting factor related to MHC molecules.	Zn-alpha2-glycoprotein (ZAG) is a soluble protein that is present in serum and other body fluids. ZAG stimulates lipid degradation in adipocytes and causes the extensive fat losses associated with some advanced cancers. The 2.8 angstrom crystal structure of ZAG resembles a class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) heavy chain, but ZAG does not bind the class I light chain beta2-microglobulin. The ZAG structure includes a large groove analogous to class I MHC peptide binding grooves. Instead of a peptide, the ZAG groove contains a nonpeptidic compound that may be implicated in lipid catabolism under normal or pathological conditions.
3351945	Crystal structure of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase complexed with its reaction product 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate.	Crystals of the flavin-containing enzyme p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (PHBHase) complexed with its reaction product were investigated in order to obtain insight into the catalytic cycle of this enzyme involving two substrates and two cofactors. PHBHase was crystallized initially with its substrate, p-hydroxybenzoate and the substrate was then converted into the product 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate by allowing the catalytic reaction to proceed in the crystals. In addition, crystals were soaked in mother liquor containing a high concentration of this product. Data up to 2.3 A (1 A = 0.1 nm) were collected by the oscillation method and the structure of the enzyme product complex was refined by alternate restrained least-squares procedures and model building by computer graphics techniques. A total of 273 solvent molecules could be located, four of them being presumably sulfate ions. The R-factor for 14,339 reflections between 6.0 A and 2.3 A is 19.3%. The 3-hydroxyl group of the product introduced by the enzyme is clearly visible in the electron density, showing unambiguously which carbon atom of the substrate is hydroxylated. A clear picture of the hydroxylation site is obtained. The plane of the product is rotated 21 degrees with respect to the plane of the substrate in the current model of enzyme-substrate complex. The 4-hydroxyl group of the product is hydrogen bonded to the hydroxyl group of Tyr201, its carboxyl group is interacting with the side-chains of Tyr222, Arg214 and Ser212, while the newly introduced 3-hydroxyl group makes a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Pro293.

9826511	Mutational destabilization of the critical interface water cluster in Scapharca dimeric hemoglobin: structural basis for altered allosteric activity.	A cluster of interface ordered water molecules has been proposed to act as a key mediator of intersubunit communication in the homodimeric hemoglobin of Scapharca inaequivalvis. Mutations of Thr72 to Val and Ile, which lack the hydroxyl group to hydrogen bond the deoxy interface water molecules, result in sharply altered functional properties. We have determined the high resolution (1.6-1. 8 A) crystal structures of these two mutants in both the deoxygenated and CO-liganded states. These structures show minimal protein structural changes relative to the same native derivatives, despite greater than 40-fold increases in oxygen affinity. In the deoxy state of both mutants two water molecules at the periphery of the water cluster are lost, and the remaining cluster water molecules are destabilized. The CO-liganded structures show key differences between the two mutants including a more optimal interface packing involving Ile72 that acts to stabilize its high affinity (R) state. This additional stabilization allows rationalization of its lowered cooperativity within the context of a two-state model. These studies support a key role of ordered water in cooperative functioning and illustrate how subtle structural alterations can result in significantly altered functional properties in an allosteric molecule.
9437427	Crystal structure of GyrA intein from Mycobacterium xenopi reveals structural basis of protein splicing.	Several genes from prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes have been found to contain an in-frame open reading frame, which encodes for an internal protein (intein). Post-translationally, the internal polypeptide auto-splices and ligates the external sequences to yield a functional external protein (extein) and an intein. Most, but not all inteins, contain, apart from a splicing domain, a separate endonucleolytic domain that enables them to maintain their presence by a homing mechanism. We report here the crystal structure of an intein found in the gyrase A subunit from Mycobacterium xenopi at 2.2 A resolution. The structure contains an unusual beta-fold with the catalytic splice junctions at the ends of two adjacent antiparallel beta-strands. The arrangement of the active site residues Ser 1, Thr 72, His 75, His 197, and Asn 198 is consistent with a four-step mechanism for the cleavage-ligation reaction. Using site-directed mutagenesis, the N-terminal cysteine, proposed as the nucleophile in the first step of the splicing reaction, was changed to a Ser 1 and Ala 0, thus capturing the intein in a pre-spliced state.
8823158	Structure and kinetics of the beta-lactamase mutants S70A and K73H from Staphylococcus aureus PC1.	Two mutant beta-lactamases from Staphylococcus aureus PC1 which probe key catalytic residues have been produced by site-directed mutagenesis. In the S70A enzyme, the nucleophilic group that attacks the beta-lactam carbonyl carbon atom was eliminated. Consequently, the kcat values for hydrolysis of benzylpenicillin and nitrocefin have been reduced by 10(4)-10(5) compared with the wild-type enzyme. The crystal structure of S70A beta-lactamase has been determined at 2.1 A resolution. With the exception of the mutation site, the structure is identical to that of the native enzyme. The residual activity is attributed either to mistranslation that leads to production of wild-type enzyme and/or to remaining features of the active site that stabilize the tetrahedral transition state. Soaking of the crystals with ampicillin or clavulanate, followed by flash-freezing, has been carried out and the structures examined at 2.0 A resolution. For both experiments, the difference electron density maps revealed buildup of density in the active site that presumably corresponds to beta-lactam binding. However, neither electron density is sufficiently clear for defining the atomic details of the bound compounds. The K73H beta-lactamase has been prepared to test the possible role of Lys73 in proton transfer. It exhibits no detectable activity toward benzylpenicillin, and 10(5)-fold reduction of kcat for nitrocefin hydrolysis compared with the wild-type enzyme. No significant recovery of activity has been measured when the pH was varied between 5.0 and 8.0. The crystal structure of K73H beta-lactamase has been determined at 1.9 A resolution. While the overall structure is similar to that of the native enzyme, the electrostatic interactions between His73 and neighboring residues indicate that the imidazole ring is positively charged. In addition, the hydroxyl group of Ser70 adopts a position that is incompatible with nucleophilic attack on substrates. A crystal soaked with ampicillin was flash-frozen, and diffraction data were collected at 2.1 A resolution. The electron density map showed no indication of substrate binding.
2010919	Reaction mechanism of alkaline phosphatase based on crystal structures. Two-metal ion catalysis.	Alkaline phosphatase (AP) is a widely distributed non-specific phosphomonoesterase that functions through formation of a covalent phosphoseryl intermediate (E-P). The enzyme also catalyzes phosphoryl transfer reaction to various alcohols. Escherichia coli AP is a homodimer with 449 residues per monomer. It is a metalloenzyme with two Zn2+ and one Mg2+ at each active site. The crystal structure of native E. coli AP complexed with inorganic phosphate (Pi), which is a strong competitive inhibitor as well as a substrate for the reverse reaction, has been refined at 2.0 A resolution. Some parts of the molecular have been retraced, starting from the previous 2.8 A study. The active site has been modified substantially and is described in this paper. The changes in the active site region suggest the need to reinterpret earlier spectral data, and suggestions are made. Also presented are the structures of the Cd-substituted enzyme complexed with inorganic phosphate at 2.5 A resolution, and the phosphate-free native enzyme at 2.8 A resolution. At pH 7.5, where the X-ray data were collected, the Cd-substituted enzyme is predominantly the covalent phosphoenzyme (E-P) while the native Zn/Mg enzyme exists in predominantly noncovalent (E.P) form. Implication of these results for the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme is discussed. APs from other sources are believed to function in a similar manner.
9295271	Structural basis for cyclic terpene biosynthesis by tobacco 5-epi-aristolochene synthase.	Terpene cyclases catalyze the synthesis of cyclic terpenes with 10-, 15-, and 20-carbon acyclic isoprenoid diphosphates as substrates. Plants have been a source of these natural products by providing a homologous set of terpene synthases. The crystal structures of 5-epi-aristolochene synthase, a sesquiterpene cyclase from tobacco, alone and complexed separately with two farnesyl diphosphate analogs were analyzed. These structures reveal an unexpected enzymatic mechanism for the synthesis of the bicyclic product, 5-epi-aristolochene, and provide a basis for understanding the stereochemical selectivity displayed by other cyclases in the biosynthesis of pharmacologically important cyclic terpenes. As such, these structures provide templates for the engineering of novel terpene cyclases.
11286890	Structures of beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase I complexed with fatty acids elucidate its catalytic machinery.	BACKGROUND: beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase (KAS) I is vital for the construction of the unsaturated fatty acid carbon skeletons characterizing E. coli membrane lipids. The new carbon-carbon bonds are created by KAS I in a Claisen condensation performed in a three-step enzymatic reaction. KAS I belongs to the thiolase fold enzymes, of which structures are known for five other enzymes. RESULTS: Structures of the catalytic Cys-Ser KAS I mutant with covalently bound C10 and C12 acyl substrates have been determined to 2.40 and 1.85 A resolution, respectively. The KAS I dimer is not changed by the formation of the complexes but reveals an asymmetric binding of the two substrates bound to the dimer. A detailed model is proposed for the catalysis of KAS I. Of the two histidines required for decarboxylation, one donates a hydrogen bond to the malonyl thioester oxo group, and the other abstracts a proton from the leaving group. CONCLUSIONS: The same mechanism is proposed for KAS II, which also has a Cys-His-His active site triad. Comparison to the active site architectures of other thiolase fold enzymes carrying out a decarboxylation step suggests that chalcone synthase and KAS III with Cys-His-Asn triads use another mechanism in which both the histidine and the asparagine interact with the thioester oxo group. The acyl binding pockets of KAS I and KAS II are so similar that they alone cannot provide the basis for their differences in substrate specificity.
8528073	Redesign of the substrate specificity of Escherichia coli aspartate aminotransferase to that of Escherichia coli tyrosine aminotransferase by homology modeling and site-directed mutagenesis.	Although several high-resolution X-ray crystallographic structures have been determined for Escherichia coli aspartate aminotransferase (eAATase), efforts to crystallize E. coli tyrosine aminotransferase (eTATase) have been unsuccessful. Sequence alignment analyses of eTATase and eAATase show 43% sequence identity and 72% sequence similarity, allowing for conservative substitutions. The high similarity of the two sequences indicates that both enzymes must have similar secondary and tertiary structures. Six active site residues of eAATase were targeted by homology modeling as being important for aromatic amino acid reactivity with eTATase. Two of these positions (Thr 109 and Asn 297) are invariant in all known aspartate aminotransferase enzymes, but differ in eTATase (Ser 109 and Ser 297). The other four positions (Val 39, Lys 41, Thr 47, and Asn 69) line the active site pocket of eAATase and are replaced by amino acids with more hydrophobic side chains in eTATase (Leu 39, Tyr 41, Ile 47, and Leu 69). These six positions in eAATase were mutated by site-directed mutagenesis to the corresponding amino acids found in eTATase in an attempt to redesign the substrate specificity of eAATase to that of eTATase. Five combinations of the individual mutations were obtained from mutagenesis reactions. The redesigned eAATase mutant containing all six mutations (Hex) displays second-order rate constants for the transamination of aspartate and phenylalanine that are within an order of magnitude of those observed for eTATase. Thus, the reactivity of eAATase with phenylalanine was increased by over three orders of magnitude without sacrificing the high transamination activity with aspartate observed for both enzymes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
15528205	Roles of distal Asp in heme oxygenase from Corynebacterium diphtheriae, HmuO: A water-driven oxygen activation mechanism.	Heme oxygenases found in mammals, plants, and bacteria catalyze degradation of heme using the same mechanism. Roles of distal Asp (Asp-136) residue in HmuO, a heme oxygenase of Corynebacterium diphtheriae, have been investigated by site-directed mutagenesis, enzyme kinetics, resonance Raman spectroscopy, and x-ray crystallography. Replacements of the Asp-136 by Ala and Phe resulted in reduced heme degradation activity due to the formation of ferryl heme, showing that the distal Asp is critical in HmuO heme oxygenase activity. D136N HmuO catalyzed heme degradation at a similar efficiency to wild type and D136E HmuO, implying that the carboxylate moiety is not required for the heme catabolism by HmuO. Resonance Raman results suggest that the inactive ferryl heme formation in the HmuO mutants is induced by disruption of the interaction between a reactive Fe-OOH species and an adjacent distal pocket water molecule. Crystal structural analysis of the HmuO mutants confirms partial disappearance of this nearby water in D136A HmuO. Our results provide the first experimental evidence for the catalytic importance of the nearby water molecule that can be universally critical in heme oxygenase catalysis and propose that the distal Asp helps in positioning the key water molecule at a position suitable for efficient activation of the Fe-OOH species.
15989951	Crystal structures of RNase H bound to an RNA/DNA hybrid: substrate specificity and metal-dependent catalysis.	RNase H belongs to a nucleotidyl-transferase superfamily, which includes transposase, retroviral integrase, Holliday junction resolvase, and RISC nuclease Argonaute. We report the crystal structures of RNase H complexed with an RNA/DNA hybrid and a mechanism for substrate recognition and two-metal-ion-dependent catalysis. RNase H specifically recognizes the A form RNA strand and the B form DNA strand. Structure comparisons lead us to predict the catalytic residues of Argonaute and conclude that two-metal-ion catalysis is a general feature of the superfamily. In nucleases, the two metal ions are asymmetrically coordinated and have distinct roles in activating the nucleophile and stabilizing the transition state. In transposases, they are symmetrically coordinated and exchange roles to alternately activate a water and a 3'-OH for successive strand cleavage and transfer by a ping-pong mechanism.
9103205	Crystal structure of the nucleotide exchange factor GrpE bound to the ATPase domain of the molecular chaperone DnaK.	The crystal structure of the adenine nucleotide exchange factor GrpE in complex with the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) domain of Escherichia coli DnaK [heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70)] was determined at 2.8 angstrom resolution. A dimer of GrpE binds asymmetrically to a single molecule of DnaK. The structure of the nucleotide-free ATPase domain in complex with GrpE resembles closely that of the nucleotide-bound mammalian Hsp70 homolog, except for an outward rotation of one of the subdomains of the protein. This conformational change is not consistent with tight nucleotide binding. Two long alpha helices extend away from the GrpE dimer and suggest a role for GrpE in peptide release from DnaK.
8925894	Rapid estimation of relative amide proton exchange rates of 15 N-labelled proteins by a straightforward water selective NOESY-HSQC experiment.	A straightforward heteronuclear pseudo-3D NOESY-HSQC pulse sequence using radiation damping to selectively invert magnetization at the water frequency was developed to estimate the amide proton exchange rates in 15N-labelled proteins. The peak intensities in the resultant 2D spectrum allow a direct classification of amide proton exchange rates according to short (ms), intermediate (ms to s) or long (> or = s) residence times. This method was successfully used for the analysis of amide proton exchange rates in the 15N-labelled FruR DNA-binding domain and pertinent information about its dynamics was obtained.
9695947	Crystal structure of the signal sequence binding subunit of the signal recognition particle.	The crystal structure of the signal sequence binding subunit of the signal recognition particle (SRP) from Thermus aquaticus reveals a deep groove bounded by a flexible loop and lined with side chains of conserved hydrophobic residues. The groove defines a flexible, hydrophobic environment that is likely to contribute to the structural plasticity necessary for SRP to bind signal sequences of different lengths and amino acid sequence. The structure also reveals a helix-turn-helix motif containing an arginine-rich alpha helix that is required for binding to SRP RNA and is implicated in forming the core of an extended RNA binding surface.
11502177	beta-Ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase I of Escherichia coli: aspects of the condensation mechanism revealed by analyses of mutations in the active site pocket.	beta-Ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein (ACP)] synthase forms new carbon-carbon bonds in three steps: transfer of an acyl primer from ACP to the enzyme, decarboxylation of the elongating substrate and its condensation with the acyl primer substrate. Six residues of Escherichia coli beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I (KAS I) implicated in these reactions were subjected to site-directed mutagenesis. Analyses of the abilities of C163A, C163S, H298A, D306A, E309A, K328A, and H333A to carry out the three reactions lead to the following conclusions. The active site Cys-163 is not required for decarboxylation, whereas His-298 and His-333 are indispensable. Neither of the histidines is essential for increasing the nucleophilicity of Cys-163 to enable transfer of the acyl primer substrate. Maintenance of the structural integrity of the active site by Asp-306 and Glu-309 is required for decarboxylation but not for transfer. One function of Lys-328 occurs very early in catalysis, potentially before transfer. These results in conjunction with structural analyses of substrate complexes have led to a model for KAS I catalysis [Olsen, J. G., Kadziola, A., von Wettstein-Knowles, P., Siggaard-Andersen, M., and Larsen, S. (2001) Structure 9, 233-243]. Another facet of catalysis revealed by the mutant analyses is that the acyl primer transfer activity of beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I is inhibited by free ACP at physiological concentrations. Differences in the inhibitory response by individual mutant proteins indicate that interaction of free ACP with Cys-163, Asp-306, Glu-309, Lys-328, and His-333 might form a sensitive regulatory mechanism for the transfer of acyl primers.
16300397	Dissecting the roles of a strictly conserved tyrosine in substrate recognition and catalysis by pseudouridine 55 synthase.	Sequence alignment of the TruA, TruB, RsuA, and RluA families of pseudouridine synthases (PsiS) identifies a strictly conserved aspartic acid, which has been shown to be the critical nucleophile for the PsiS-catalyzed formation of pseudouridine (Psi). However, superposition of the representative structures from these four families of enzymes identifies two additional amino acids, a lysine or an arginine (K/R) and a tyrosine (Y), from a K/RxY motif that are structurally conserved in the active site. We have created a series of Thermotoga maritima and Escherichia coli pseudouridine 55 synthase (Psi55S) mutants in which the conserved Y is mutated to other amino acids. A new crystal structure of the T. maritima Psi55S Y67F mutant in complex with a 5FU-RNA at 2.4 A resolution revealed formation of 5-fluoro-6-hydroxypseudouridine (5FhPsi), the same product previously seen in wild-type Psi55S-5FU-RNA complex structures. HPLC analysis confirmed efficient formation of 5FhPsi by both Psi55S Y67F and Y67L mutants but to a much lesser extent by the Y67A mutant when 5FU-RNA substrate was used. However, both HPLC analysis and a tritium release assay indicated that these mutants had no detectable enzymatic activity when the natural RNA substrate was used. The combined structural and mutational studies lead us to propose that the side chain of the conserved tyrosine in these four families of PsiS plays a dual role within the active site, maintaining the structural integrity of the active site through its hydrophobic phenyl ring and acting as a general base through its OH group for the proton abstraction required in the last step of PsiS-catalyzed formation of Psi.
1896431	The crystal structure of staphylococcal nuclease refined at 1.7 A resolution.	The crystal structure of staphylococcal nuclease has been determined to 1.7 A resolution with a final R-factor of 16.2% using stereochemically restrained Hendrickson-Konnert least-squares refinement. The structure reveals a number of conformational changes relative to the structure of the ternary complex of staphylococcal nuclease 1,2 bound with deoxythymidine-3',5'-diphosphate and Ca2+. Tyr-113 and Tyr-115, which pack against the nucleotide base in the nuclease complex, are rotated outward creating a more open binding pocket in the absence of nucleotide. The side chains of Ca2+ ligands Asp-21 and Asp-40 shift as does Glu-43, the proposed general base in the hydrolysis of the 5'-phosphodiester bond. The significance of some changes in the catalytic site is uncertain due to the intrusion of a symmetry related Lys-70 side chain which hydrogen bonds to both Asp-21 and Glu-43. The position of a flexible loop centered around residue 50 is altered, most likely due to conformational changes propagated from the Ca2+ site. The side chains of Arg-35, Lys-84, Tyr-85, and Arg-87, which hydrogen bond to the 3'- and 5'-phosphates of the nucleotide in the nuclease complex, are unchanged in conformation, with packing interactions with adjacent protein side chains sufficient to fix the geometry in the absence of ligand. The nuclease structure presented here, in combination with the stereochemically restrained refinement of the nuclease complex structure at 1.65 A, provides a wealth of structural information for the increasing number of studies using staphylococcal nuclease as a model system of protein structure and function.
7651351	alpha-Conotoxin ImI exhibits subtype-specific nicotinic acetylcholine receptor blockade: preferential inhibition of homomeric alpha 7 and alpha 9 receptors.	Through a study of cloned nicotinic receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes, we provide evidence that alpha-conotoxin ImI, a peptide marine snail toxin that induces seizures in rodents, selectively blocks subtypes of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. alpha-Conotoxin ImI blocks homomeric alpha 7 nicotinic receptors with the highest apparent affinity and homomeric alpha 9 receptors with 8-fold lower affinity. This toxin has no effect on receptors composed of alpha 2 beta 2, alpha 3 beta 2, alpha 4 beta 2, alpha 2 beta 4, alpha 3 beta 4, or alpha 4 beta 4 subunit combinations. In contrast to alpha-bungarotoxin, which has high affinity for alpha 7, alpha 9, and alpha 1 beta 1 gamma delta receptors, alpha-conotoxin ImI has low affinity for the muscle nAChR. Related Conus peptides, alpha-conotoxins MI and GI, exhibit a distinct specificity, strictly targeting the muscle subtype receptor but not alpha 7 or alpha 9 receptors. alpha-Conotoxins thus represent selective tools for the study of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.
15610006	Enhancing the activity of insulin at the receptor interface: crystal structure and photo-cross-linking of A8 analogues.	The receptor-binding surface of insulin is broadly conserved, reflecting its evolutionary optimization. Neighboring positions nevertheless offer an opportunity to enhance activity, through either transmitted structural changes or introduction of novel contacts. Nonconserved residue A8 is of particular interest as Thr(A8) --> His substitution (a species variant in birds and fish) augments the potency of human insulin. Diverse A8 substitutions are well tolerated, suggesting that the hormone-receptor interface is not tightly packed at this site. To resolve whether enhanced activity is directly or indirectly mediated by the variant A8 side chain, we have determined the crystal structure of His(A8)-insulin and investigated the photo-cross-linking properties of an A8 analogue containing p-azidophenylalanine. The structure, characterized as a T(3)R(3)(f) zinc hexamer at 1.8 A resolution, is essentially identical to that of native insulin. The photoactivatable analogue exhibits efficient cross-linking to the insulin receptor. The site of cross-linking lies within a 14 kDa C-terminal domain of the alpha-subunit. This contact, to our knowledge the first to be demonstrated from the A chain, is inconsistent with a recent model of the hormone-receptor complex derived from electron microscopy. Optimizing the binding interaction of a nonconserved side chain on the surface of insulin may thus enhance its activity.
15166214	Cross-talk between thiamin diphosphate binding and phosphorylation loop conformation in human branched-chain alpha-keto acid decarboxylase/dehydrogenase.	The decarboxylase/dehydrogenase (E1b) component of the 4-megadalton human branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKD) metabolic machine is a thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent enzyme with a heterotetrameric cofactor-binding fold. The E1b component catalyzes the decarboxylation of alpha-keto acids and the subsequent reductive acylation of the lipoic acid-bearing domain (LBD) from the 24-meric transacylase (E2b) core. In the present study, we show that the binding of cofactor ThDP to the E1b active site induces a disorder-to-order transition of the conserved phosphorylation loop carrying the two phosphorylation sites Ser(292)-alpha and Ser(302)-alpha, as deduced from the 1.80-1.85 A apoE1b and holoE1b structures. The induced loop conformation is essential for the recognition of lipoylated LBD to initiate E1b-catalyzed reductive acylation. Alterations of invariant Arg(287)-alpha, Asp(295)-alpha, Tyr(300)-alpha, and Arg(301)-alpha that form a hydrogen-bonding network in the phosphorylation loop result in the disordering of the loop conformation as elucidated by limited proteolysis, accompanied by the impaired binding and diminished reductive acylation of lipoylated LBD. In contrast, k(cat) values for E1b-catalyzed decarboxylation of the alpha-keto acid are higher in these E1b mutants than in wild-type E1b, with higher K(m) values for the substrate in the mutants. ThDP binding that orders the loop prevents phosphorylation of E1b by the BCKD kinase and averts the inactivation of wild-type E1b, but not the above mutants, by this covalent modification. Our results establish that the cross-talk between the bound ThDP and the phosphorylation loop conformation serves as a feed-forward switch for multiple reaction steps in the BCKD metabolic machine.
12424132	Ramachandran plot on the web.	A graphics package has been developed to display the main chain torsion angles phi, psi (phi, Psi); (Ramachandran angles) in a protein of known structure. In addition, the package calculates the Ramachandran angles at the central residue in the stretch of three amino acids having specified the flanking residue types. The package displays the Ramachandran angles along with a detailed analysis output. This software is incorporated with all the protein structures available in the Protein Databank.
15591246	Tyr702 is an important determinant of agonist binding and domain closure of the ligand-binding core of GluR2.	Ionotropic glutamate receptors mediate most rapid excitatory synaptic transmission in the mammalian central nervous system, and their involvement in neurological diseases has stimulated widespread interest in their structure and function. Despite a large number of agonists developed so far, few display selectivity among (S)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazol-4-yl) propionic acid (AMPA)-receptor subtypes. The present study provides X-ray structures of the glutamate receptor 2 (GluR2)-selective partial agonist (S)-2-amino-3-(1,3,5,6,7-pentahydro-2,4-dioxocyclopenta[e] pyrimidin-1-yl) propanoic acid [(S)-CPW399] in complex with the ligand-binding core of GluR2 (GluR2-S1S2J) and with a (Y702F)GluR2-S1S2J mutant. In addition, the structure of the nonselective partial agonist kainate in complex with (Y702F)GluR2-S1S2J was determined. The results show that the selectivity of (S)-CPW399 toward full-length GluR2 relative to GluR3 is reflected in the binding data on the two soluble constructs, allowing the use of (Y702F)GluR2-S1S2J as a model system for studying GluR2/GluR3 selectivity. Structural comparisons suggest that selectivity arises from disruption of a water-mediated network between ligand and receptor. A D1-D2 domain closure occurs upon agonist binding. (S)-CPW399 and kainate induce greater domain closure in the Y702F mutant, indicating that these partial agonists here act in a manner more reminiscent of full agonists. Both kainate and (S)-CPW399 exhibited higher efficacy at (Y702F)GluR2(Q)i than at wild-type GluR2(Q)i. Whereas an excellent correlation exists between domain closure and efficacy of a range of agonists at full-length GluR2 determined by electrophysiology in Xenopus laevis oocytes, a direct correlation between agonist induced domain closure of (Y702F)GluR2-S1S2J and efficacy at the GluR3 receptor is not observed. Although it clearly controls selectivity, mutation of this residue alone is insufficient to explain agonist-induced conformational rearrangements occurring in this variant.
10387007	Escherichia coli methionine aminopeptidase: implications of crystallographic analyses of the native, mutant, and inhibited enzymes for the mechanism of catalysis.	By improving the expression and purification of Escherichia coli methionine aminopeptidase (eMetAP) and using slightly different crystallization conditions, the resolution of the parent structure was extended from 2.4 to 1.9 A resolution. This has permitted visualization of the coordination geometry and solvent structure of the active-site dinuclear metal center. One solvent molecule (likely a mu-hydroxide) bridges the trigonal bipyramidal (Co1) and octahedral (Co2) cobalt ions. A second solvent (possibly a hydroxide ion) is bound terminally to Co2. A monovalent cation binding site was also identified about 13 A away from the metal center at an interface between the two subdomains of the protein. The first structure of a substrate-like inhibitor, (3R)-amino-(2S)-hydroxyheptanoyl-L-Ala-L-Leu-L-Val-L-Phe-OMe, bound to a methionine aminopeptidase, has also been determined. This inhibitor coordinates the metal center through four interactions as follows: (i) ligation of the N-terminal (3R)-nitrogen to Co2, (ii, iii) bridging coordination of the (2S)-hydroxyl group, and (iv) terminal ligation to Co1 by the keto oxygen of the pseudo-peptide linkage. Inhibitor binding occurs with the displacement of two solvent ligands and the expansion of the coordination sphere of Co1. In addition to the tetradentate, bis-chelate metal coordination, the substrate analogue forms hydrogen bonds with His79 and His178, two conserved residues within the active site of all MetAPs. To evaluate their importance in catalysis His79 and His178 were replaced with alanine. Both substitutions, but especially that of His79, reduce activity. The structure of the His79Ala apoenzyme and the comparison of its electronic absorption spectra with other variants suggest that the loss in activity is not due to a conformational change or a defective metal center. Two different reaction mechanisms are proposed and are compared to those of related enzymes. These results also suggest that inhibitors analogous to that reported here may be useful in preventing angiogenesis in cancer and in the treatment of microbial and fungal infections.
12441390	Crystal structures and increased stabilization of the protein G variants with switched folding pathways NuG1 and NuG2.	We recently described two protein G variants (NuG1 and NuG2) with redesigned first hairpins that were almost twice as stable, folded 100-fold faster, and had a switched folding mechanism relative to the wild-type protein. To test the structural accuracy of our design algorithm and to provide insights to the dramatic changes in the kinetics and thermodynamics of folding, we have now determined the crystal structures of NuG1 and NuG2 to 1.8 A and 1.85 A, respectively. We find that they adopt hairpin structures that are closer to the computational models than to wild-type protein G; the RMSD of the NuG1 hairpin to the design model and the wild-type structure are 1.7 A and 5.1 A, respectively. The crystallographic B factor in the redesigned first hairpin of NuG1 is systematically higher than the second hairpin, suggesting that the redesigned region is somewhat less rigid. A second round of structure-based design yielded new variants of NuG1 and NuG2, which are further stabilized by 0.5 kcal/mole and 0.9 kcal/mole.
9430701	Crystal structure of a calcium-phospholipid binding domain from cytosolic phospholipase A2.	Cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) is a calcium-sensitive 85-kDa enzyme that hydrolyzes arachidonic acid-containing membrane phospholipids to initiate the biosynthesis of eicosanoids and platelet-activating factor, potent inflammatory mediators. The calcium-dependent activation of the enzyme is mediated by an N-terminal C2 domain, which is responsible for calcium-dependent translocation of the enzyme to membranes and that enables the intact enzyme to hydrolyze membrane-resident substrates. The 2.4-A x-ray crystal structure of this C2 domain was solved by multiple isomorphous replacement and reveals a beta-sandwich with the same topology as the C2 domain from phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C delta 1. Two clusters of exposed hydrophobic residues surround two adjacent calcium binding sites. This region, along with an adjoining strip of basic residues, appear to constitute the membrane binding motif. The structure provides a striking insight into the relative importance of hydrophobic and electrostatic components of membrane binding for cPLA2. Although hydrophobic interactions predominate for cPLA2, for other C2 domains such as in "conventional" protein kinase C and synaptotagmins, electrostatic forces prevail.
15465054	Structures of unliganded and inhibitor complexes of W168F, a Loop6 hinge mutant of Plasmodium falciparum triosephosphate isomerase: observation of an intermediate position of loop6.	The enzymatic reaction of triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) is controlled by the movement of a loop (loop6, residues 166-176). Crystal structures of TIMs from a variety of sources have revealed that the loop6, which is in an open conformation in the unliganded enzyme, adopts a closed conformation in inhibitor complexes. In contrast, structures with loop open conformation are obtained in most of the complexes of TIM from the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum (PfTIM). W168 is a conserved N-terminal hinge residue, involved in different sets of interactions in the "open" and "closed" forms of loop6. The role of W168 in determining the loop conformation was examined by structural studies on the mutant W168F and its complexes with ligands. The three-dimensional structures of unliganded mutant (1.8 A) and complexes with sulfate (2.8 A) and glycerol-2-phosphate (G2P) (2.8 A) have been determined. Loop6 was found disordered in these structures, reflecting the importance of W168 in stabilizing either the open or the closed states. Critical sequence differences between the Plasmodium enzyme and other TIMs may influence the equilibrium between the closed and open forms. Examination of the environment of the loop6 shows that its propensity for the open or the closed forms is influenced not only by Phe96 as suggested earlier, but also by Asn233, which occurs in the vicinity of the active site. This residue is Gly in the other TIM sequences and probably plays a crucial role in the mode of ligand binding, which in turn affects the loop opening/closing process in PfTIM.
11738044	The structure of the feruloyl esterase module of xylanase 10B from Clostridium thermocellum provides insights into substrate recognition.	BACKGROUND: Degradation of the plant cell wall requires the synergistic action of a consortium of predominantly modular enzymes. In Clostridiae, these biocatalysts are organized into a supramolecular assembly termed a "cellulosome." This multienzyme complex possesses, in addition to its well-described cellulolytic activity, an apparatus specific for xylan degradation. Cinnamic acid esterases hydrolyze the ferulate groups involved in the crosslinking of arabinoxylans to lignin and thus play a key role in the degradation of the plant cell wall in addition to having promising industrial and medical applications. RESULTS: We have cloned and overexpressed the feruloyl esterase module from a 5 domain xylanase, Xyn10B from Clostridium thermocellum. The native structure at 1.6 A resolution has been solved with selenomethionine multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion and refined to a final R(free) of 17.8%. The structure of a hydrolytically inactive mutant, S954A, in complex with the reaction product ferulic acid has been refined at a resolution of 1.4 A with an R(free) of 16.0%. CONCLUSIONS: The C. thermocellum Xyn10B ferulic acid esterase displays the alpha/beta-hydrolase fold and possesses a classical Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad. Ferulate esterases are characterized by their specificity, and the active center reveals the binding site for ferulic acid and related compounds. Ferulate binds in a small surface depression that possesses specificity determinants for both the methoxy and hydroxyl ring substituents of the substrate. There appears to be a lack of specificity for the xylan backbone, which may reflect the intrinsic chemical heterogeneity of the natural substrate.
15837192	Crystallographic evidence for substrate-assisted GTP hydrolysis by a small GTP binding protein.	GTP hydrolysis by small GTP binding proteins of the Ras superfamily is a universal reaction that controls multiple cellular regulations. Its enzymic mechanism has been the subject of long-standing debates as to the existence/identity of the general base and the electronic nature of its transition state. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of a small GTP binding protein, Rab11, solved in complex with GDP and Pi. Unexpectedly, a Pi oxygen and the GDP-cleaved oxygen are located less than 2.5 A apart, suggesting that they share a proton, likely in the form of a low-barrier hydrogen bond. This implies that the gamma-phosphate of GTP was protonated; hence, that GTP acts as a general base. Furthermore, this interaction should establish at, and stabilize, the transition state. Altogether, we propose a revised model for the GTPase reaction that should reconcile earlier models into a unique substrate-assisted mechanism.
15388918	Use of an ion-binding site to bypass the 1000-atom limit to structure determination by direct methods.	Proteins with more than 1000 non-H atoms and without heavy-atom prosthetic groups are very difficult to solve by ab initio direct methods. T4 lysozyme is being used to explore these limits. The protein has 1309 non-H atoms, seven S atoms, no disulfide bonds and no heavy-atom prosthetic group. It is recalcitrant to structure determination by direct methods using X-ray diffraction data to 0.97 A. It is shown here that it is possible to obtain a truly ab initio structure determination of a variant of the protein that has an Rb+ (Z = 37) binding site. Using diffraction data to 1.06 A resolution, the direct-methods programs SIR2002 and ACORN independently solved the structure in about 20 h. The bound Rb+, which contributes about 1.7% of the total scattering, does not appear to distort the structure or to inhibit refinement (R factor 12.1%). The phases obtained via SIR2002 or ACORN are in good agreement with those from a reference structure obtained from conventional molecular-substitution and refinement procedures (average error in the figure-of-merit-weighted phases of less than 25 degrees). Thus, proteins with more than 1000 atoms that include halide-binding or other such sites may be amenable to structure determination by ab initio direct methods. The direct-methods approaches are also compared with structure determination via use of the anomalous scattering of the Rb+ ion. As shown by examples, high-resolution structures determined by direct methods can be useful in highlighting regions of strain in the protein, including short hydrogen bonds and non-planar peptide groups.
15381425	The crystal structure of an EST2 mutant unveils structural insights on the H group of the carboxylesterase/lipase family.	Esterase 2 (EST2) from the thermophilic eubacterium Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius is a thermostable serine hydrolase belonging to the H group of the esterase/lipase family. This enzyme hydrolyzes monoacylesters of different acyl-chain length and various compounds with industrial interest. EST2 displays an optimal temperature at 70 degrees C and maximal activity with pNP-esters having acyl-chain bearing from six to eight carbon atoms. EST2 mutants with different substrate specificity were also designed, generated by site-directed mutagenesis, and biochemically characterized. To better define at structural level the enzyme reaction mechanism, a crystallographic analysis of one of these mutants, namely M211S/R215L, was undertaken. Here we report its three-dimensional structure at 2.10A resolution. Structural analysis of the enzyme revealed an unexpected dimer formation as a consequence of a domain-swapping event involving its N-terminal region. This phenomenon was absent in the case of the enzyme bound to an irreversible inhibitor having optimal substrate structural features. A detailed comparison of the enzyme structures before and following binding to this molecule showed a movement of the N-terminal helices resulting from a trans-cis isomerization of the F37-P38 peptide bond. These findings suggest that this carboxylesterase presents two distinct structural arrangements reminiscent of the open and closed forms already reported for lipases. Potential biological implications associated with the observed quaternary reorganization are here discussed in light of the biochemical properties of other lipolytic members of the H group.
12595710	Crystallization and initial X-ray diffraction of BtuB, the integral membrane cobalamin transporter of Escherichia coli.	BtuB, the cobalamin transporter from Escherichia coli, has been overexpressed, purified and crystallized. The purified protein was solubilized in n-octyl tetraoxyethylene (C(8)E(4)) and was crystallized using sitting-drop vapor diffusion with PEG 3350 and magnesium acetate as precipitants (pH 6.5). Two crystal forms have been obtained. Crystal type I belongs to space group P3(1)21, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 81.6, c = 210.0 A, alpha = beta = 90, gamma = 120 degrees. Crystal type II belongs to space group P3(1)21, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 81.6, c = 226.0 A, alpha = beta = 90, gamma = 120 degrees. Each crystal form contains a monomer in the asymmetric unit. Diffraction for crystal type I extends to 2.0 A and diffraction for crystal type II extends to 2.7 A. Both crystal forms are suitable for structure determination.
15351654	Structure of the constitutively active double mutant CheYD13K Y106W alone and in complex with a FliM peptide.	CheY is a member of the response regulator protein superfamily that controls the chemotactic swimming response of motile bacteria. The CheY double mutant D13K Y106W (CheY**) is resistant to phosphorylation, yet is a highly effective mimic of phosphorylated CheY in vivo and in vitro. The conformational attributes of this protein that enable it to signal in a phosphorylation-independent manner are unknown. We have solved the crystal structure of selenomethionine-substituted CheY** in the presence of its target, a peptide (FliM16) derived from the flagellar motor switch, FliM, to 1.5A resolution with an R-factor of 19.6%. The asymmetric unit contains four CheY** molecules, two with FliM16 bound, and two without. The two CheY** molecules in the asymmetric unit that are bound to FliM16 adopt a conformation similar to BeF3- -activated wild-type CheY, and also bind FliM16 in a nearly identical manner. The CheY** molecules that do not bind FliM16 are found in a conformation similar to unphosphorylated wild-type CheY, suggesting that the active phenotype of this mutant is enabled by a facile interconversion between the active and inactive conformations. Finally, we propose a ligand-binding model for CheY and CheY**, in which Ile95 changes conformation in a Tyr/Trp106-dependent manner to accommodate FliM.
10669613	Solution structure and dynamics of the Rous sarcoma virus capsid protein and comparison with capsid proteins of other retroviruses.	The solution structure and dynamics of the recombinant 240 amino acid residue capsid protein from the Rous sarcoma virus has been determined by NMR methods. The structure was determined using 2200 distance restraints and 330 torsion angle restraints, and the dynamics analysis was based on (15)N relaxation parameters (R(1), R(2), and (1)H-(15)N NOE) measured for 153 backbone amide groups. The monomeric protein consists of independently folded N- and C-terminal domains that comprise residues Leu14-Leu146 and Ala150-Gln226, respectively. The domains exhibit different rotational correlation times (16.6(+/-0.1) ns and 12.6(+/-0.1) ns, respectively), are connected by a flexible linker (Ala147-Pro149), and do not give rise to inter-domain NOE values, indicating that they are dynamically independent. Despite limited sequence similarity, the structure of the Rous sarcoma virus capsid protein is similar to the structures determined recently for the capsid proteins of retroviruses belonging to the lentivirus and human T-cell leukemia virus/bovine leukemia virus genera. Structural differences that exist in the C-terminal domain of Rous sarcoma virus capsid relative to the other capsid proteins appear to be related to the occurrence of conserved cysteine residues. Whereas most genera of retroviruses contain a pair of conserved and essential cysteine residues in the C-terminal domain that appear to function by forming an intramolecular disulfide bond during assembly, the Rous sarcoma virus capsid protein does not. Instead, the Rous sarcoma virus capsid protein contains a single cysteine residue that appears to be conserved among the avian C-type retroviruses and is positioned in a manner that might allow the formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond during capsid assembly.
9281429	Crystal structures of a mutant maltotetraose-forming exo-amylase cocrystallized with maltopentaose.	The three-dimensional structures of the catalytic residue Glu219-->Gln mutant of Pseudomonas stutzeri maltotetraose-forming exo-alpha-amylase, and its complex with carbohydrate obtained by cocrystallization with maltopentaose were determined. Two crystal forms were obtained for the complexed enzyme, and a bound maltotetraose was found in each. The structures were analyzed at 2.2 A and 1.9 A resolution, respectively for the uncomplexed and complexed mutant. These structures were compared with the wild-type enzyme structure. In the complexed crystals, the maltotetraose was firmly bound, extensively interacting with the amino acid environments in the active cleft. The non-reducing end glucose unit was hydrogen bonded to the side-chain of Asp160 and the main-chain nitrogen of Gly158, which seem to be predominantly required for the recognition of the non-reducing end of the substrate that determines the exo-wise degradation of this enzyme. The reducing end glucose unit of bound maltotetraose showed clear deformation, adopting a half-chair conformation with extensive hydrogen bonds to surrounding polypeptides. The C1-atom of this deformed glucose unit lies very close to Asp193OD1 with a distance of 2.6 A. The catalytic residue Asp294 is firmly hydrogen-bonded to the O2 and O3-hydroxyl groups of the deformed reducing end glucose unit. Upon binding of the carbohydrate, small but significant induced fits were observed in the regions of Asp294, Phe156, Ile157, and Asp160. Possible roles of the three catalytic residues are also discussed.
8515471	Crystals of human growth hormone-receptor complexes. Extracellular domains of the growth hormone and prolactin receptors and a hormone mutant designed to prevent receptor dimerization.	A single-site human growth hormone mutant (hGH[G120R]), which inhibits receptor dimerization, was used to produce single crystals, suitable for high-resolution diffraction studies, of 1:1 complexes with the ligand-binding domain of the growth hormone receptor (hGHbp) and of the prolactin receptor (hPRLbp). Crystals of the hGH[G120R]-hGHbp complex are in space group P4(1)2(1)2 or P4(3)2(1)2 with a = 67.7 A, c = 228.0 A, and diffract to at least 2.2 A. Crystals of the complex between hGH[G120R] and hPRLbp are in space group P2(1)2(1)2 with a = 154.0 A, b = 68.4 A, c = 42.9 A, and diffract to at least 2.8 A. The structures of these two complexes will shed light on the early events in receptor activation, and provide the basis for an analysis of receptor specificity of growth hormone and prolactin.
15554622	Observation of an unprecedented Cu Bis-His site: crystal structure of the H129V mutant of nitrite reductase.	Copper nitrite reductases contain both an electron-transfer type 1 Cu site and a catalytic type 2 Cu site. We have mutated one of the type 2 copper ligating histidines to observe the effect on catalytic turnover. This mutation has created a unique site where Cu is ligated by 2 His Nepsilon2 atoms alone.
15210359	Concerted structural changes in the peptidase and the propeller domains of prolyl oligopeptidase are required for substrate binding.	Prolyl oligopeptidase contains a peptidase domain and its catalytic triad is covered by the central tunnel of a seven-bladed beta-propeller. This domain makes the enzyme an oligopeptidase by excluding large structured peptides from the active site. The apparently rigid crystal structure does not explain how the substrate can approach the catalytic groups. Two possibilities of substrate access were investigated: either blades 1 and 7 of the propeller domain move apart, or the peptidase and/or propeller domains move to create an entry site at the domain interface. Engineering disulfide bridges to the expected oscillating structures prevented such movements, which destroyed the catalytic activity and precluded substrate binding. This indicated that concerted movements of the propeller and the peptidase domains are essential for the enzyme action.
14645372	Structural basis for the coordinated regulation of transglutaminase 3 by guanine nucleotides and calcium/magnesium.	Transglutaminase 3 (TGase 3) is a member of a family of Ca2+-dependent enzymes that catalyze covalent cross-linking reactions between proteins or peptides. TGase 3 isoform is widely expressed and is important for effective epithelial barrier formation in the assembly of the cell envelope. Among the nine TGase enzyme isoforms known in the human genome, only TGase 2 is known to bind and hydrolyze GTP to GDP; binding GTP inhibits its transamidation activity but allows it to function in signal transduction. Here we present biochemical and crystallographic evidence for the direct binding of GTP/GDP to the active TGase 3 enzyme, and we show that the TGase 3 enzyme undergoes a GTPase cycle. The crystal structures of active TGase 3 with guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTPgammaS) and GDP were determined to 2.1 and 1.9 A resolution, respectively. These studies reveal for the first time the reciprocal actions of Ca2+ and GTP with respect to TGase 3 activity. GTPgammaS binding is coordinated with the replacement of a bound Ca2+ with Mg2+ and conformational rearrangements that together close a central channel to the active site. Hydrolysis of GTP to GDP results in two stable conformations, resembling both the GTP state and the non-nucleotide bound state, the latter of which allows substrate access to the active site.
11310979	Preliminary crystallographic studies of Y25F mutant of periplasmic Escherichia coli L-asparaginase.	Periplasmic Escherichia coli L-asparaginase II with Y25F mutation in the active-site cavity has been obtained by recombinant techniques. The protein was crystallized in a new hexagonal form (P6(5)22). Single crystals of this polymorph, suitable for X-ray diffraction, were obtained by vapor diffusion using 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol as precipitant (pH 4.8). The crystals are characterized by a = 81.0, c = 341.1 A and diffract to 2.45 A resolution. The asymmetric unit contains two protein molecules arranged into an AB dimer. The physiologically relevant ABA'B' homotetramer is generated by the action of the crystallographic 2-fold axis along [1, -1, 0]. Kinetic studies show that the loss of the phenolic hydroxyl group at position 25 brought about by the replacement of Y with F strongly impairs kcat without significantly affecting Km.
9699637	Obligatory steps in protein folding and the conformational diversity of the transition state.	We have analyzed the existence of obligatory steps in the folding reaction of the alpha-spectrin SH3 domain by mutating Asp 48 (D48G), which is at position i+3 of an isolated two-residue type II' beta-turn. Calorimetry and X-ray analysis show an entropic stabilizing effect resulting from local changes at the dihedral angles of the beta-turn. Kinetic analysis of D48G shows that this beta-turn is fully formed in the transition state, while there is no evidence of its formation in an isolated fragment. Introduction of several mutations in the D48G protein reveals that the local stabilization has not significantly altered the transition state ensemble. All these results, together with previous analysis of other alpha-spectrin and src SH3 mutants, indicate that: (i) in the folding reaction there could be obligatory steps which are not necessarily part of the folding nucleus; (ii) transition state ensembles in beta-sheet proteins could be quite defined and conformationally restricted ('mechanic folding nucleus'); and (iii) transition state ensembles in some proteins could be evolutionarily conserved.
10903949	Insights into molybdenum cofactor deficiency provided by the crystal structure of the molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis protein MoaC.	BACKGROUND: The molybdenum cofactor (Moco) is an essential component of a large family of enzymes involved in important transformations in carbon, nitrogen and sulfur metabolism. The Moco biosynthetic pathway is evolutionarily conserved and found in archaea, eubacteria and eukaryotes. In humans, genetic deficiencies of enzymes involved in this pathway trigger an autosomal recessive and usually deadly disease with severe neurological symptoms. The MoaC protein, together with the MoaA protein, is involved in the first step of Moco biosynthesis. RESULTS: MoaC from Escherichia coli has been expressed and purified to homogeneity and its crystal structure determined at 2 A resolution. The enzyme is organized into a tightly packed hexamer with 32 symmetry. The monomer consists of an antiparallel, four-stranded beta sheet packed against two long alpha helices, and its fold belongs to the ferredoxin-like family. Analysis of structural and biochemical data strongly suggests that the active site is located at the interface of two monomers in a pocket that contains several strictly conserved residues. CONCLUSIONS: Asp128 in the putative active site appears to be important for catalysis as its replacement with alanine almost completely abolishes protein activity. The structure of the Asp128-->Ala variant reveals substantial conformational changes in an adjacent loop. In the human MoaC ortholog, substitution of Thr182 with proline causes Moco deficiency, and the corresponding substitution in MoaC severely compromises activity. This residue is located near the N-terminal end of helix alpha4 at an interface between two monomers. The MoaC structure provides a framework for the analysis of additional dysfunctional mutations in the corresponding human gene.
7060551	Glutathione reductase from human erythrocytes. The sequences of the NADPH domain and of the interface domain.	1. Sequence analysis of the NADPH domain (residues 158--293) and of the interface domain (365--478) was based on 12 CNBr fragments, which were isolated using ion-exchange chromatography and paper methods. Fragments with more than 15 residues were digested further with trypsin and chymotrypsin. The isolated peptides were sequenced by automated solid-phase Edman degradation. All sequenced peptides were ordered and overlapped by computerized comparisons with a complete sequence guessed from the electron density map of the protein. In the case of short CNBr fragments, this alignment was confirmed by the sequence analysis of protein fragments resulting from incomplete CNBr cleavage. 2. In the NADPH domain, residue 197, which is involved in an induced-fit mechanism, was identified as a tyrosine. The structure of the NADPH domain is probably homologous with the NAD domain of lipoamide dehydrogenase and with the FAD domain of several proteins, but not with NADPH domains of known chain-fold in other proteins. 3. The paper completes the sequence analysis of glutathione reductase so that the enzyme is now known in atomic detail. The numbering scheme of the chemically determined sequence will be used henceforth in crystallographic studies also. As inferred from the sequence data each of the two identical chains contains 478 amino acid residues, the composition being Cys10, Asp21, Asn17, Thr31, Ser31, Glu29, Gln11, Pro24, Gly43, Ala42, Val44, Met15, Ile29, Leu34, Tyr13, Phe14, Lys34, His16. Arg17, and Trp3. From these data an Mr of 2 x 51 600 was calculated for the FAD-free apoenzyme and an Mr of 2 x 42 400 for the holoenzyme.
7664726	Crystal structure of the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus in complex with myo-inositol.	Phosphatidylinositol (PI), once regarded as an obscure component of membranes, is now recognized as an important reservoir of second messenger precursors and as an anchor for membrane enzymes. PI-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) is the enzyme that cleaves PI, invoking numerous cellular responses. The crystal structure of PI-PLC from Bacillus cereus (EC 3.1.4.10) has been solved at 2.6 A resolution and refined to a crystallographic R factor of 18.7%. The structure consists of an imperfect (beta alpha)8-barrel similar to that first observed for triose phosphate isomerase and does not resemble any other known phospholipase structure. The active site of the enzyme has been identified by determining the structure of PI-PLC in complex with its inhibitor, myo-inositol, at 2.6 A resolution (R factor = 19.5%). This substrate-like inhibitor interacts with a number of residues highly conserved among prokaryotic PI-PLCs. Residues His32 and His82, which are also conserved between prokaryotic and eukaryotic PI-PLCs, most likely act as general base and acid respectively in a catalytic mechanism analogous to that observed for ribonucleases.
10966642	Structural basis of dimerization, coactivator recognition and MODY3 mutations in HNF-1alpha.	Maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3) results from mutations in the transcriptional activator hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha). Several MODY3 mutations target the HNF-1alpha dimerization domain (HNF-p1), which binds the coactivator, dimerization cofactor of HNF-1 (DCoH). To define the mechanism of coactivator recognition and the basis for the MODY3 phenotype, we determined the cocrystal structure of the DCoH-HNF-p1 complex and characterized biochemically the effects of MODY3 mutations in HNF-p1. The DCoH-HNF-p1 complex comprises a dimer of dimers in which HNF-p1 forms a unique four-helix bundle. Through rearrangements of interfacial side chains, a single, bifunctional interface in the DCoH dimer mediates both HNF-1alpha binding and formation of a competing, transcriptionally inactive DCoH homotetramer. Consistent with the structure, MODY3 mutations in HNF-p1 reduce activator function by two distinct mechanisms.
12746447	Crystal structure of the tRNA processing enzyme RNase PH from Aquifex aeolicus.	RNase PH is one of the exoribonucleases that catalyze the 3' end processing of tRNA in bacteria. RNase PH removes nucleotides following the CCA sequence of tRNA precursors by phosphorolysis and generates mature tRNAs with amino acid acceptor activity. In this study, we determined the crystal structure of Aquifex aeolicus RNase PH bound with a phosphate, a co-substrate, in the active site at 2.3-A resolution. RNase PH has the typical alpha/beta fold, which forms a hexameric ring structure as a trimer of dimers. This ring structure resembles that of the polynucleotide phosphorylase core domain homotrimer, another phosphorolytic exoribonuclease. Four amino acid residues, Arg-86, Gly-124, Thr-125, and Arg-126, of RNase PH are involved in the phosphate-binding site. Mutational analyses of these residues showed their importance in the phosphorolysis reaction. A docking model with the tRNA acceptor stem suggests how RNase PH accommodates substrate RNAs.
7549887	Crystallization and preliminary X-ray crystallographic studies on Type III antifreeze protein.	Type III antifreeze protein, more specifically the recombinant QAE-Sephadex-binding isoform, has been crystallized in 50-55% saturated ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 4.0-4.5. The resultant crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121 with a = 32.60 A, b = 39.00 A, and c = 46.57 A and diffract to at least 1.7 A. A set of 1.7-A native data has been collected, with completeness 93.4% and Rsym of 0.069. Initial screening for heavy-atom derivatives has yielded a Pt-bound derivative.
7540934	High resolution structures of HIV-1 RT from four RT-inhibitor complexes.	We have determined the structures of four complexes of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase with non-nucleoside inhibitors, three fully refined at high resolution. The highest resolution structure is of the RT-nevirapine complex which has an R-factor of 0.186 and a root-mean-square bond length deviation of 0.015 A for all data to 2.2 A. The structures reveal a common mode of binding for these chemically diverse compounds. The common features of binding are largely hydrophobic interactions and arise from induced shape complementarity achieved by conformational rearrangement of the enzyme and conformational/configurational rearrangement of the compounds.
12805457	Crystallographic identification of a noncompetitive inhibitor binding site on the hepatitis C virus NS5B RNA polymerase enzyme.	The virus-encoded nonstructural protein 5B (NS5B) of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and is absolutely required for replication of the virus. NS5B exhibits significant differences from cellular polymerases and therefore has become an attractive target for anti-HCV therapy. Using a high-throughput screen, we discovered a novel NS5B inhibitor that binds to the enzyme noncompetitively with respect to nucleotide substrates. Here we report the crystal structure of NS5B complexed with this small molecule inhibitor. Unexpectedly, the inhibitor is bound within a narrow cleft on the protein's surface in the "thumb" domain, about 30 A from the enzyme's catalytic center. The interaction between this inhibitor and NS5B occurs without dramatic changes to the structure of the protein, and sequence analysis suggests that the binding site is conserved across known HCV genotypes. Possible mechanisms of inhibition include perturbation of protein dynamics, interference with RNA binding, and disruption of enzyme oligomerization.
9894812	Structure, genomic localization and recombinant expression of the mouse 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase gene.	The 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS) is the second enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway from GTP to tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). BH4 is an essential cofactor of NO synthases and aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, the latter being responsible for hepatic phenylalanine degradation and monoamine neurotransmitter biosynthesis. BH4 deficiency due to autosomal recessive mutations in the human gene for PTPS leads to a broad range of phenotypes ranging from mild hyperphenylalaninemia to high phenylalanine levels concomitant with neurotransmitter depletion. An animal model to study PTPS deficiency is thus desired to investigate the molecular basis of the disease and its variability. Here, we report on the isolation and recombinant expression of the mouse PTPS gene, Pts. It is located on chromosome 9C-D and contains six exons with an open reading frame of 144 codons. The derived protein monomer has a molecular mass of 16187 Da and shows 82% and 93% identity to its human and rat counterparts, respectively. The mouse PTPS was expressed in bacterial cells and purified to homogeneity. The kinetic properties of the recombinant protein, apparent Km of approximately 10 microM and k(cat) of 0.27 s(-1), were similar to the native mouse enzyme in liver and brain extracts, and to the corresponding human and rat PTPS.
7608966	NMR structure of a stable "OB-fold" sub-domain isolated from staphylococcal nuclease.	Similar folds often occur in proteins with dissimilar sequences. The OB-fold forms a part of the structures of at least seven non-homologous proteins that share either oligonucleotide or oligosaccharide binding functions. A 1-103 fragment corresponding to the OB-fold of the 149 amino acid residue staphylococcal nuclease gives NMR spectra characteristic of an unfolded protein, i.e. the wild-type nuclease sequence is insufficient to maintain a stable tertiary structure in the absence of the C-terminal one-third of this single-domain protein. By contrast, the 1-103 fragment of nuclease with the mutations Val66Leu and Gly88Val adopts a stable tertiary structure. The NMR solution structure of this latter fragment is a close variation of the OB-fold found in the X-ray structure of the parent protein. The Val66Leu and Gly88Val mutations appear to stabilize tertiary structure by consolidating the hydrophobic core of the nuclease OB-fold sub-domain. Taken together, these results suggest that recurrent structural motifs such as the OB-fold may in some cases represent vestiges of autonomous folding units that, during evolution, have become integrated into more complex cooperative folding domains.
14596591	Crystal structure of allo-Ile(A2)-insulin, an inactive chiral analogue: implications for the mechanism of receptor binding.	The crystal structure of an inactive chiral analogue of insulin containing nonstandard substitution allo-Ile(A2) is described at 2.0 A resolution. In native insulin, the invariant Ile(A2) side chain anchors the N-terminal alpha-helix of the A-chain to the hydrophobic core. The structure of the variant protein was determined by molecular replacement as a T(3)R(3) zinc hexamer. Whereas respective T- and R-state main-chain structures are similar to those of native insulin (main-chain root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) of 0.45 and 0.54 A, respectively), differences in core packing are observed near the variant side chain. The R-state core resembles that of the native R-state with a local inversion of A2 orientation (core side chain RMSD 0.75 A excluding A2); in the T-state, allo-Ile(A2) exhibits an altered conformation in association with the reorganization of the surrounding side chains (RMSD 0.98 A). Surprisingly, the core of the R-state is similar to that observed in solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies of an engineered T-like monomer containing the same chiral substitution (allo-Ile(A2)-DKP-insulin; Xu, B., Hua, Q. X., Nakagawa, S. H., Jia, W., Chu, Y. C., Katsoyannis, P. G., and Weiss, M. A. (2002) J. Mol. Biol. 316, 435-441). Simulation of NOESY spectra based on crystallographic protomers enables the analysis of similarities and differences in solution. The different responses of the T- and R-state cores to chiral perturbation illustrates both their intrinsic plasticity and constraints imposed by hexamer assembly. Although variant T- and R-protomers retain nativelike protein surfaces, the receptor-binding activity of allo-Ile(A2)-insulin is low (2% relative to native insulin). This seeming paradox suggests that insulin undergoes a change in conformation to expose Ile(A2) at the hormone-receptor interface.
15170321	DNA cleavage by EcoRV endonuclease: two metal ions in three metal ion binding sites.	Four crystal structures of EcoRV endonuclease mutants K92A and K38A provide new insight into the mechanism of DNA bending and the structural basis for metal-dependent phosphodiester bond cleavage. The removal of a key active site positive charge in the uncleaved K92A-DNA-M(2+) substrate complex results in binding of a sodium ion in the position of the amine nitrogen, suggesting a key role for a positive charge at this position in stabilizing the sharp DNA bend prior to cleavage. By contrast, two structures of K38A cocrystallized with DNA and Mn(2+) ions in different lattice environments reveal cleaved product complexes featuring a common, novel conformation of the scissile phosphate group as compared to all previous EcoRV structures. In these structures, the released 5'-phosphate and 3'-OH groups remain in close juxtaposition with each other and with two Mn(2+) ions that bridge the conserved active site carboxylates. The scissile phosphates are found midway between their positions in the prereactive substrate and postreactive product complexes of the wild-type enzyme. Mn(2+) ions occupy two of the three sites previously described in the prereactive complexes and are plausibly positioned to generate the nucleophilic hydroxide ion, to compensate for the incipient additional negative charge in the transition state, and to ionize a second water for protonation of the 3'-oxyanion. Reconciliation of these findings with earlier X-ray and fluorescence studies suggests a novel mechanism in which a single initially bound metal ion in a third distinct site undergoes a shift in position together with movement of the scissile phosphate deeper into the active site cleft. This reconfigures the local environment to permit binding of the second metal ion followed by movement toward the pentacovalent transition state. The new mechanism suggested here embodies key features of previously proposed two- and three-metal catalytic models, and offers a view of the stereochemical pathway that integrates much of the copious structural and functional data that are available from exhaustive studies in many laboratories.
9136873	Identification of a loop outside the active site cavity of the human immunodeficiency virus proteases which confers inhibitor specificity.	We have investigated the inhibitor specificity for the proteases of the human immunodeficiency viruses, types 1 and 2. Using a series of related inhibitors, the P1' side chain was confirmed to play a significant role in determining both the absolute and relative affinity for the enzymes. To further define the residues in the enzymes responsible for the difference in affinity, chimeric proteins were constructed in which domains of the respective proteases were exchanged at the genetic level. The results of these studies demonstrated that inhibitor affinity is conferred by a combination of the active site residues (32, 47, and 82) along with a loop comprised of residues 31 and 33-37, which lies outside of the active site cavity. These results are discussed in terms of existing structural data.
8599765	Identification of the primary metal ion-activation sites of the diphtheria tox repressor by X-ray crystallography and site-directed mutational analysis.	The diphtheria tox repressor, DtxR, is a 226 amino acid transition metal ion-activated regulatory protein that controls the expression of diphtheria toxin in toxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The previously solved three-dimensional DtxR structures have identified two potential metal ion binding sites which may play a role in the activation of DNA binding by the repressor. We have used both X-ray crystallographic and site-directed mutational analysis of DtxR(C102D)-Ni2+ complexes and DtxR to identify the metal ion-binding site which results in the activation of the repressor. We demonstrate that DtxR contains both a primary and an ancillary metal ion binding site. The primary site functions directly in the activation of DNA binding. In contrast, the ancillary site contributes weakly, if at all, to activation.
7883193	Overproduction, purification and structural characterization of the functional N-terminal DNA-binding domain of the fru repressor from Escherichia coli K-12.	A DNA fragment encoding the DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1-60) of the Escherichia coli fru transcriptional regulator was cloned into the pGEX-KT vector and expressed in frame with the fused gene encoding glutathione S-transferase. The fusion protein was purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography on immobilized glutathione, and then cleaved with thrombin. After separation by a cation-exchange chromatography step, the DNA-binding domain exhibited proper folding, as shown by proton NMR analysis. Furthermore, it showed specific interaction with the operator region of the ace operon, as checked by gel retardation and DNA methylation-protection experiments.
16484367	The molecular architecture of the metalloprotease FtsH.	The ATP-dependent integral membrane protease FtsH is universally conserved in bacteria. Orthologs exist in chloroplasts and mitochondria, where in humans the loss of a close FtsH-homolog causes a form of spastic paraplegia. FtsH plays a crucial role in quality control by degrading unneeded or damaged membrane proteins, but it also targets soluble signaling factors like sigma(32) and lambda-CII. We report here the crystal structure of a soluble FtsH construct that is functional in caseinolytic and ATPase assays. The molecular architecture of this hexameric molecule consists of two rings where the protease domains possess an all-helical fold and form a flat hexagon that is covered by a toroid built by the AAA domains. The active site of the protease classifies FtsH as an Asp-zincin, contrary to a previous report. The different symmetries of protease and AAA rings suggest a possible translocation mechanism of the target polypeptide chain into the interior of the molecule where the proteolytic sites are located.
2006420	The three-dimensional structure of canine parvovirus and its functional implications.	The three-dimensional atomic structure of a single-stranded DNA virus has been determined. Infectious virions of canine parvovirus contain 60 protein subunits that are predominantly VP-2. The central structural motif of VP-2 has the same topology (an eight-stranded antiparallel beta barrel) as has been found in many other icosahedral viruses but represents only about one-third of the capsid protein. There is a 22 angstrom (A) long protrusion on the threefold axes, a 15 A deep canyon circulating about each of the five cylindrical structures at the fivefold axes, and a 15 A deep depression at the twofold axes. By analogy with rhinoviruses, the canyon may be the site of receptor attachment. Residues related to the antigenic properties of the virus are found on the threefold protrusions. Some of the amino termini of VP-2 run to the exterior in full but not empty virions, which is consistent with the observation that some VP-2 polypeptides in full particles can be cleaved by trypsin. Eleven nucleotides are seen in each of 60 symmetry-related pockets on the interior surface of the capsid and together account for 13 percent of the genome.
9698564	A pH-dependent stabilization of an active site loop observed from low and high pH crystal structures of mutant monomeric glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase at 1.8 to 1.9 A.	A mutation in the dimer interface of Escherichia coli glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase (GarTfase) disrupts the observed pH-dependent association of the wild-type enzyme, but has no observable effect on the enzyme activity. Here, we assess whether a pH effect on the enzyme's conformation is sufficient by itself to explain the pH-dependence of the GarTfase reaction. A pH-dependent conformational change is observed between two high-resolution crystal structures of the Glu70Ala mutant GarTfase at pH 3.5 (1.8 A) and 7.5 (1.9 A). Residues 110 to 131 in GarTfase undergo a transformation from a disordered loop at pH 3.5, where the enzyme is inactive, to an ordered loop-helix structure at pH 7.5, where the enzyme is active. The ordering of this flexible loop-helix has a direct effect on catalytic residues in the active site, binding of the folate cofactor and shielding of the active site from solvent. A main-chain carbonyl oxygen atom from Tyr115 in the ordered loop forms a hydrogen bond with His108, and thereby provides electronic and structural stabilization of this key active site residue. Kinetic data indicate that the pKa of His108 is in fact raised to 9. 2. The loop movement can be correlated with elevation of the His pKa, but with further stabilization, probably from Asp144, after the binding of folate cofactor. Leu118, also in the loop, becomes positioned near the p-amino benzoic acid binding site, providing additional hydrophobic interactions with the cofactor 10-formyl tetrahydrofolate. Thus, the pH-dependence of the enzyme activity appears to arise from local active site rearrangements and not from differences due to monomer-dimer association.
12732641	Structure and dynamics of the C-domain of human cardiac troponin C in complex with the inhibitory region of human cardiac troponin I.	Cardiac troponin C is the Ca2+-dependent switch for heart muscle contraction. Troponin C is associated with various other proteins including troponin I and troponin T. The interaction between the subunits within the troponin complex is of critical importance in understanding contractility. Following a Ca2+ signal to begin contraction, the inhibitory region of troponin I comprising residues Thr128-Arg147 relocates from its binding surface on actin to troponin C, triggering movement of troponin-tropomyosin within the thin filament and thereby freeing actin-binding site(s) for interactions with the myosin ATPase of the thick filament to generate the power stroke. The structure of calcium-saturated cardiac troponin C (C-domain) in complex with the inhibitory region of troponin I was determined using multinuclear and multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The structure of this complex reveals that the inhibitory region adopts a helical conformation spanning residues Leu134-Lys139, with a novel orientation between the E- and H-helices of troponin C, which is largely stabilized by electrostatic interactions. By using isotope labeling, we have studied the dynamics of the protein and peptide in the binary complex. The structure of this inhibited complex provides a framework for understanding into interactions within the troponin complex upon heart contraction.
15235589	Nucleotide insertion opposite a cis-syn thymine dimer by a replicative DNA polymerase from bacteriophage T7.	Ultraviolet-induced DNA damage poses a lethal block to replication. To understand the structural basis for this, we determined crystal structures of a replicative DNA polymerase from bacteriophage T7 in complex with nucleotide substrates and a DNA template containing a cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD). When the 3' thymine is the templating base, the CPD is rotated out of the polymerase active site and the fingers subdomain adopts an open orientation. When the 5' thymine is the templating base, the CPD lies within the polymerase active site where it base-pairs with the incoming nucleotide and the 3' base of the primer, while the fingers are in a closed conformation. These structures reveal the basis for the strong block of DNA replication that is caused by this photolesion.
15213399	Expression, purification and crystallization of a functional core of the voltage-dependent calcium channel beta subunit.	Two versions of the functional core of the rabbit voltage-dependent calcium channel beta2a subunit were expressed in Escherichia coli. These proteins were purified to homogeneity and screened for crystallization. Crystallization conditions were refined using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method and two crystal forms were pursued. Crystal form I is represented by thick rods with tetragonal symmetry, unit-cell parameters a = b = 75, c = 165 A and a diffraction limit of 3.4 A which were obtained using ammonium sulfate as a precipitant. Crystal form II gives rise to plates with orthorhombic symmetry, unit-cell parameters a = 35, b = 75, c = 165 A and a diffraction limit of 2.3 A which were grown using polyethylene glycol 20K as a precipitant.
11052791	Identification of novel inhibitors of urokinase via NMR-based screening.	Using an NMR-based screen, a novel class of urokinase inhibitors were identified that contain a 2-aminobenzimidazole moiety. The inhibitory potency of this family of inhibitors is similar to that of inhibitors containing a guanidine or amidine group. However, unlike previously described guanidino- or amidino-based inhibitors which have pK(a) values greater than 9.0, urokinase inhibitors containing a 2-aminobenzimidazole have pK(a) values of 7.5. Thus, 2-aminobenzimidazoles may have improved pharmacokinetic properties which could increase the bioavailability of inhibitors which contain this moiety. A crystal structure of one of the lead inhibitors, 2-amino-5-hydroxybenzimidazole, complexed with urokinase reveals the electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions that stabilize complex formation and suggests nearby subsites that may be accessed to increase the potency of this new series of urokinase inhibitors.
15779910	Effect of pH on the active site of an Arg121Cys mutant of the metallo-beta-lactamase from Bacillus cereus: implications for the enzyme mechanism.	The zinc-dependent metallo-beta-lactamases are a group of bacterial enzymes that pose a threat to the future efficacy of present-day antibiotics. Their mechanism is poorly understood, and there are no clinically useful inhibitors. While most members of the group contain two tightly bound zinc ions in their active sites, the Bacillus cereus enzyme has a much lower affinity for its second zinc (Zn2), thought to be due to the presence of Arg121 immediately beneath the floor of the active site (cf. Cys/Ser/His121 in the bizinc enzymes). Crystal structures of the Arg121Cys mutant of the B. cereus 569/H/9 enzyme were solved at pH 7.0, 5.0, and 4.5, each in the presence of either 20 microM or 20 mM Zn(2+) to generate the mono- and bizinc forms, respectively. Surprisingly, the structure of the active site was unaffected by the mutation; a network of ordered water molecules replaced the interactions made by the arginine side chain, and the occupancy of Zn2 appeared minimally changed. As the pH was lowered, Zn2 moved away from one of its ligands, Asp120, but was "tracked" by two others, Cys221 and His263. Furthermore, the hydroxide ion (and proposed nucleophile for beta-lactam hydrolysis) was bound to Zn1 at pH 5 and above but absent at pH 4.5. This provides experimental evidence for an earlier proposed mechanism in which protonation of Asp120 and the Zn1-bound hydroxide are the two events that lead to the loss of activity at low pH.
8381964	Pathway of proton transfer in bacterial reaction centers: second-site mutation Asn-M44-->Asp restores electron and proton transfer in reaction centers from the photosynthetically deficient Asp-L213-->Asn mutant of Rhodobacter sphaeroides.	Site-directed mutagenesis of the photosynthetic reaction center (RC) from Rhodobacter sphaeroides has shown Asp-213 of the L subunit (Asp-L213) to be important for photosynthetic viability. Replacement of Asp-L213 with Asn resulted in a photosynthetically deficient mutant, due to the 10(4)-fold slower rate for the proton-coupled electron transfer reaction QA-QB- + 2H+-->QAQBH2 (k(2)AB). The detrimental effect of Asn-L213 is surprising since RCs from Rhodopseudomonas viridis, Rhodospirillum rubrum, and Chloroflexus aurantiacus have Asn at the homologous position. However, RCs from these bacteria have an Asp located near QB (the secondary quinone acceptor) at the position homologous to Asn-M44 in Rb. sphaeroides which might function in place of Asp-L213. To test this conjecture a "viridis-like" structure was introduced into Rb. sphaeroides by replacing Asp-L213 with Asn and Asn-M44 with Asp. The RCs from this double mutant displayed near-native rates for the electron transfer reaction k(2)AB and restored photosynthetic competence. The rates for the first electron transfer reaction QA-QB-->QAQB- (k(1)AB) and charge recombination D+QAQB--->DQAQB (kBD) were also restored to near-native values. These results indicate that Asp at either the L213 or the M44 site near QB can provide a pathway for rapid proton transfer and explain why Asp-L213 need not be conserved in different photosynthetic bacteria. To test further the effect of Asp at M44 on electron and proton transfer to QB a mutant containing Asp at both L213 and M44 was constructed. The RCs from this mutant (Asn-M44-->Asp) exhibited faster proton-coupled electron transfer to QB-. The increased rate of proton-coupled electron transfer (k(2)AB) in the presence of negatively charged Asp residues near QB suggests the role of an Asp near QB as (i) a proton donor group in the proton transfer chain and/or (ii) a negatively charged residue stabilizing proton transfer to reduced QB.
9614112	Crystal structures of reaction intermediates of L-2-haloacid dehalogenase and implications for the reaction mechanism.	Crystal structures of L-2-haloacid dehalogenase from Pseudomonas sp. YL complexed with monochloroacetate, L-2-chlorobutyrate, L-2-chloro-3-methylbutyrate, or L-2-chloro-4-methylvalerate were determined at 1.83-, 2.0-, 2.2-, and 2.2-A resolutions, respectively, using the complex crystals prepared with the S175A mutant, which are isomorphous with those of the wild-type enzyme. These structures exhibit unique structural features that correspond to those of the reaction intermediates. In each case, the nucleophile Asp-10 is esterified with the dechlorinated moiety of the substrate. The substrate moieties in all but the monochloroacetate intermediate have a D-configuration at the C2 atom. The overall polypeptide fold of each of the intermediates is similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. However, it is clear that the Asp-10-Ser-20 region moves to the active site in all of the intermediates, and the Tyr-91-Asp-102 and Leu-117-Arg-135 regions make conformational changes in all but the monochloroacetate intermediates. Ser-118 is located near the carboxyl group of the substrate moiety; this residue probably serves as a binding residue for the substrate carboxyl group. The hydrophobic pocket, which is primarily composed of the Tyr-12, Gln-42, Leu-45, Phe-60, Lys-151, Asn-177, and Trp-179 side chains, exists around the alkyl group of the substrate moiety. This pocket may play an important role in stabilizing the alkyl group of the substrate moiety through hydrophobic interactions, and may also play a role in determining the stereospecificity of the enzyme. Moreover, a water molecule, which is absent in the substrate-free enzyme, is present in the vicinities of the carboxyl carbon of Asp-10 and the side chains of Asp-180, Asn-177, and Ala-175 in each intermediate. This water molecule may hydrolyze the ester intermediate and its substrate. These findings crystallographically demonstrate that the enzyme reaction proceeds through the formation of an ester intermediate with the enzyme's nucleophile Asp-10.
9741848	Crystal structures of HLA-A*0201 complexed with antigenic peptides with either the amino- or carboxyl-terminal group substituted by a methyl group.	The crystal structures of class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules complexed with antigenic peptides revealed a network of hydrogen bonds between the charged amino- and carboxyl-termini of the peptides and conserved MHC residues at both ends of the peptide binding site. These interactions were shown to contribute substantially to the stability of class I MHC/peptide complexes by thermal denaturation studies using synthetic peptides in which either the amino- or carboxyl-terminal group is substituted by a methyl group. Here we report crystal structures of HLA-A*0201 complexed with these terminally modified synthetic peptides showing that they adopt the same bound conformation as antigenic peptides. A number of variations in peptide conformation were observed for the terminally modified peptides, including in one case, a large conformational difference in four central peptide residues that is apparently caused by the lattice contact. This is reminiscent of the way binding a T-cell receptor changed the conformation of central residues of an MHC-bound peptide. The structures determined identify which conserved hydrogen bonds are eliminated in terminally substituted peptides and suggest an increased energetic importance of the interactions at the peptide termini for MHC-peptide stability.
15115397	Roles of conformational and positional adaptability in structure-based design of TMC125-R165335 (etravirine) and related non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors that are highly potent and effective against wild-type and drug-resistant HIV-1 variants.	Anti-AIDS drug candidate and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) TMC125-R165335 (etravirine) caused an initial drop in viral load similar to that observed with a five-drug combination in naove patients and retains potency in patients infected with NNRTI-resistant HIV-1 variants. TMC125-R165335 and related anti-AIDS drug candidates can bind the enzyme RT in multiple conformations and thereby escape the effects of drug-resistance mutations. Structural studies showed that this inhibitor and other diarylpyrimidine (DAPY) analogues can adapt to changes in the NNRTI-binding pocket in several ways: (1). DAPY analogues can bind in at least two conformationally distinct modes; (2). within a given binding mode, torsional flexibility ("wiggling") of DAPY analogues permits access to numerous conformational variants; and (3). the compact design of the DAPY analogues permits significant repositioning and reorientation (translation and rotation) within the pocket ("jiggling"). Such adaptations appear to be critical for potency against wild-type and a wide range of drug-resistant mutant HIV-1 RTs. Exploitation of favorable components of inhibitor conformational flexibility (such as torsional flexibility about strategically located chemical bonds) can be a powerful drug design concept, especially for designing drugs that will be effective against rapidly mutating targets.
12646375	Multiple methionine substitutions are tolerated in T4 lysozyme and have coupled effects on folding and stability.	In order to further explore the tolerance of proteins to amino acid substitutions within the interior, a series of core residues was replaced by methionine within the C-terminal domain of T4 lysozyme. By replacing leucine, isoleucine, valine and phenylalanine residues a total of 10 methionines could be introduced, which corresponds to a third of the residues that are buried in this domain. As more methionines are incorporated the protein gradually loses stability. This is attributed in part to a reduction in hydrophobic stabilization, in part to the increased entropic cost of localizing the long, flexible methionine sidechains, and in part to steric clashes. The changes in structure of the mutants relative to the wildtype protein are modest but tend to increase in an additive fashion as more methionines are included. In the most extreme case, namely the 10-methionine mutant, much of the C-terminal domain remains quite similar to wildtype (root-mean-square backbone shifts of 0.56 A), while the F and G helices undergo rotations of approximately 20 degrees and center-of-mass shifts of approximately 1.4 A. For up to six methionine substitutions the changes in stability are additive. Beyond this point, however, the multiple mutants are somewhat more stable than suggested from the sum of their constituents, especially for those including the replacement Val111-->Met. This is interpreted in terms of the larger structural changes associated with this substitution. The substituted sidechains in the mutant structures have somewhat higher crystallographic thermal factors than their counterparts in WT*. Nevertheless, the interiors of the mutant proteins retain a well-defined structure with little suggestion of molten-globule characteristics. Lysozymes in which selenomethionine has been incorporated rather than methionine tend to have increased stability. At the same time they also fold faster. This provides further evidence that, at the rate-limiting step in folding, the structure of the C-terminal domain of T4 lysozyme is similar to that of the fully folded protein.
7500361	The refined X-ray structure of muconate lactonizing enzyme from Pseudomonas putida PRS2000 at 1.85 A resolution.	We report here the refined X-ray crystal structure of muconate lactonizing enzyme (MLE) from Pseudomonas putida PRS2000 at a resolution of 1.85 A with an R-factor of 16.8%. An enzyme from the beta-ketoadipate pathway, MLE catalyses the conversion of cis,cis-muconate to muconolactone. It is a homo-octamer, one monomer consisting of 373 amino acid residues. MLE has two large domains and a C-terminal subdomain: an alpha + beta domain, an alpha beta-barrel domain and a C-terminal meandering subdomain. The alpha beta-barrel domain is highly irregular. Its structure is (beta/alpha)7 beta, with the structural role of the last alpha-helix being replaced by both the C-terminal subdomain and part of the N-terminal domain. The fifth, seventh and eighth barrel strands are unusual because they have left-handed twist about their axes. The strand crossing angles also vary enormously, from +9 degrees to -69 degrees; the first and last strands, which close the barrel, cross at an angle of -69 degrees, making extensive strand-strand hydrogen bonding impossible. The first barrel strand is also unusual because it starts in the N-terminal domain and forms hydrogen bonds to the C-terminal subdomain beta-sheet as well as to its neighbouring strands in the barrel. It thus cements the whole protein together. As in other alpha beta-barrel proteins, the active site of MLE, present in each subunit is at the C-terminal ends of the barrel beta-strands. The active site cleft contains an essential manganese ion, is lined with charged and other polar residues, and contains many of the crystallographic water molecules. The manganese ion is octahedrally co-ordinated to three side-chain carboxylate groups and three water molecules, and is at the centre of a radiating web of ionic and hydrogen-bonding interactions. Additionally, two water molecules are buried in the centre of the barrel and two hydrophilic side-chains (Lys167 and Arg196) make both hydrophobic and hydrophilic packing interactions with much of the barrel interior. The barrel interior is thus also unusual because it is so hydrophilic; the dominating force appears to be the need to solvate the metal ion effectively. This might account for the irregularity of the barrel. The catalytic mechanism has been investigated by docking both substrate and product in the active site with the C-COO- of muconolactone superimposed on the corresponding atoms of cis,cis-muconate. In agreement with earlier kinetic and spectroscopic results, the manganese ion does not interact directly with substrate or product.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
11086992	Mechanisms for activation and antagonism of an AMPA-sensitive glutamate receptor: crystal structures of the GluR2 ligand binding core.	Crystal structures of the GluR2 ligand binding core (S1S2) have been determined in the apo state and in the presence of the antagonist DNQX, the partial agonist kainate, and the full agonists AMPA and glutamate. The domains of the S1S2 ligand binding core are expanded in the apo state and contract upon ligand binding with the extent of domain separation decreasing in the order of apo > DNQX > kainate > glutamate approximately equal to AMPA. These results suggest that agonist-induced domain closure gates the transmembrane channel and the extent of receptor activation depends upon the degree of domain closure. AMPA and glutamate also promote a 180 degrees flip of a trans peptide bond in the ligand binding site. The crystal packing of the ligand binding cores suggests modes for subunit-subunit contact in the intact receptor and mechanisms by which allosteric effectors modulate receptor activity.
8703213	A protein phosphorylation switch at the conserved allosteric site in GP.	A phosphorylation-initiated mechanism of local protein refolding activates yeast glycogen phosphorylase (GP). Refolding of the phosphorylated amino-terminus was shown to create a hydrophobic cluster that wedges into the subunit interface of the enzyme to trigger activation. The phosphorylated threonine is buried in the allosteric site. The mechanism implicates glucose 6-phosphate, the allosteric inhibitor, in facilitating dephosphorylation by dislodging the buried covalent phosphate through binding competition. Thus, protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation may also be controlled through regulation of the accessibility of the phosphorylation site to kinases and phosphatases. In mammalian glycogen phosphorylase, phosphorylation occurs at a distinct locus. The corresponding allosteric site binds a ligand activator, adenosine monophosphate, which triggers activation by a mechanism analogous to that of phosphorylation in the yeast enzyme.
2558377	Structural analysis of antiviral agents that interact with the capsid of human rhinoviruses.	X-Ray diffraction data have been obtained for nine related antiviral agents ("WIN compounds") while bound to human rhinovirus 14 (HRV14). These compounds can inhibit both viral attachment to host cells and uncoating. To calculate interpretable electron density maps it was necessary to account for (1) the low (approximately 60%) occupancies of these compounds in the crystal, (2) the large (up to 7.9 A) conformational changes induced at the attachment site, and (3) the incomplete diffraction data. Application of a density difference map technique, which exploits the 20-fold noncrystallographic redundancy in HRV14, resulted in clear images of the HRV14:WIN complexes. A real-space refinement procedure was used to fit atomic models to these maps. The binding site of WIN compounds in HRV14 is a hydrophobic pocket composed mainly from residues that form the beta-barrel of VP1. Among rhinoviruses, the residues associated with the binding pocket are far more conserved than external residues and are mostly contained within regular secondary structural elements. Molecular dynamics simulations of three HRV14:WIN complexes suggest that portions of the WIN compounds and viral protein near the entrance of the binding pocket are more flexible than portions deeper within the beta-barrel.
3586019	Structure of bacteriophage T4 lysozyme refined at 1.7 A resolution.	The structure of the lysozyme from bacteriophage T4 has been refined at 1.7 A resolution to a crystallographic residual of 19.3%. The final model has bond lengths and bond angles that differ from "ideal" values by 0.019 A and 2.7 degrees, respectively. The crystals are grown from electron-dense phosphate solutions and the use of an appropriate solvent continuum substantially improved the agreement between the observed and calculated structure factors at low resolution. Apart from changes in the conformations of some side-chains, the refinement confirms the structure of the molecule as initially derived from a 2.4 A resolution electron density map. There are 118 well-ordered solvent molecules that are associated with the T4 lysozyme molecule in the crystal. Four of these are more-or-less buried. There is a clustering of water molecules within the active site cleft but, other than this, the solvent molecules are dispersed around the surface of the molecule and do not aggregate into ice-like structures or pentagonal or hexagonal clusters. The apparent motion of T4 lysozyme in the crystal can be interpreted in terms of significant interdomain motion corresponding to an opening and closing of the active site cleft. For the amino-terminal domain the motion can be described equally well (correlation coefficients approx. 0.87) as quasi-rigid-body motion either about a point or about an axis of rotation. The motion in the crystals of the carboxy-terminal domain is best described as rotation about an axis (correlation coefficient 0.80) although in this case the apparent motion seems to be influenced in part by crystal contacts and may be of questionable relevance to dynamics in solution.
1512262	A third quaternary structure of human hemoglobin A at 1.7-A resolution.	Previous crystallographic studies have shown that human hemoglobin A can adopt two stable quaternary structures, one for deoxyhemoglobin (the T-state) and one for liganded hemoglobin (the R-state). In this paper we report our finding of a second quaternary structure (the R2-state) for liganded hemoglobin A. The magnitudes of the spatial differences between the R- and R2-states are as large as those between the R- and T-states. Of particular interest are the structural changes that occur as a result of R-T and R-R2 transitions at the so-called "switch" region of the critical alpha 1 beta 2 interface. In the R-state, His-97 beta 2 is positioned between Thr-38 alpha 1 and Thr-41 alpha 1, whereas in transition to the T-state His 97 beta 2 must "jump" a turn in the alpha 1 C helix to form nonpolar contacts with Thr-41 alpha 1 and Pro-44 alpha 1. This facet of the R-T transition presents a major steric barrier to the quaternary structure change. In the R2-state, His-97 beta 2 simply rotates away from threonines 38 alpha 1 and 41 alpha 1, breaking contact with these residues and allowing water access to the center of the alpha 1 beta 2 interface. With the switch region in an open position in the R2-state, His-97 beta 2 should be able to move by Thr-41 alpha 1 and make the transition to the T-state with a steric barrier that is less than that for the R-T transition. Thus the R2-state may function as a stable intermediate along a R-R2-T pathway. The T-, R-, and R2-states must coexist in solution. That is, the fact that these states can be crystallized implies that they are all energetically accessible structures. What remains to be determined are the T-to-R, T-to-R2, and R-to-R2 equilibrium constants for hemoglobin under various solution conditions and ligation states. Although this may prove to be difficult, we discuss previously published results which indicate that low concentrations of inorganic anions or low pH may favor the R2-state and at least one alpha 1 beta 2 interface mutation stabilizes a quaternary structure that is very similar to the R2-state.
12832805	Effect of mutations in the T1.5 loop of pectate lyase A from Erwinia chrysanthemi EC16.	Pectate lyase A (PelA) is a pectate-degrading enzyme secreted by plant pathogens. PelA from Erwinia chrysanthemi has 61% amino-acid identity and a conserved structural similarity to pectate lyase E (PelE). Although similar in structure and sequence, the enzymatic characteristics of PelA differ from those for PelE. A structural alignment of PelA and PelE reveals differences in the T1.5 loop. The sequence of the T1.5 loop in PelA was mutated to the homologous sequence in PelE. The crystal structure of the PelA T1.5 mutant has been solved to 1.6 and 2.9 A resolution. The enzymatic and structural properties of the T1.5 mutant are discussed.
8590022	Role of C-terminal B-chain residues in insulin assembly: the structure of hexameric LysB28ProB29-human insulin.	BACKGROUND: LysB28ProB29-human insulin (Humalog), a fully potent insulin analog in which the prolyl, lysyl sequence at the C-terminal end of the B-chain is inverted, exhibits a decreased association of monomers to dimers leading to rapid in vivo absorption. This provides important benefits for the insulin-requiring diabetic. In spite of its monomeric nature, LysB28ProB29-human insulin can exist as a discrete hexameric structure in the presence of both zinc and phenol. Studies of the crystal structure of LysB28ProB29-human insulin in a hexameric complex were initiated to gain a molecular understanding of the effect of the sequence inversion on the analog's self-association properties and, consequently, its in vivo efficacy. RESULTS: Under the conditions reported, LysB28ProB29-human insulin crystallized as a T3Rf3 hexamer that is isomorphous with the uncomplexed T3Rf3 native human insulin hexamer previously known as '4Zn insulin'. The three-dimensional structure of the T3Rf3 hexamer was determined by X-ray crystallographic methods to a resolution of 2.3 A. The prolyl, lysyl sequence inversion leads to local conformational changes at the C termini of the B-chains which eliminate two critical hydrophobic interactions and weaken two terminal beta-sheet hydrogen bonds that stabilize the dimer. CONCLUSIONS: The loss of these native dimer interactions weakens the hexameric LysB28ProB29-human insulin complex formed in the presence of phenolic ligands. Thus, it is hypothesized that the diffusion of the phenolic ligands from the site of injection results in the dissociation of hexamers directly to monomers, thereby maintaining the rapid time-action of the monomeric analog in spite of the hexameric conformation in therapeutic formulations.
11428899	Crystal structure of pentaerythritol tetranitrate reductase: "flipped" binding geometries for steroid substrates in different redox states of the enzyme.	Pentaerythritol tetranitrate reductase (PETN reductase) degrades high explosive molecules including nitrate esters, nitroaromatics and cyclic triazine compounds. The enzyme also binds a variety of cyclic enones, including steroids; some steroids act as substrates whilst others are inhibitors. Understanding the basis of reactivity with cyclic enones requires structural information for the enzyme and key complexes formed with steroid substrates and inhibitors. The crystal structure of oxidised and reduced PETN reductase at 1.5 A resolution establishes a close structural similarity to the beta/alpha-barrel flavoenzyme, old yellow enzyme. In complexes of oxidised PETN reductase with progesterone (an inhibitor), 1,4-androstadiene-3,17-dione and prednisone (both substrates) the steroids are stacked over the si-face of the flavin in an orientation different from that reported for old yellow enzyme. The specifically reducible 1,2 unsaturated bonds in 1,4-androstadiene-3,17-dione and prednisone are not optimally aligned with the flavin N5 in oxidised enzyme complexes. These structures suggest either relative "flipping" or shifting of the steroid with respect to the flavin when bound in different redox forms of the enzyme. Deuterium transfer from nicotinamide coenzyme to 1,4-androstadiene-3,17-dione via the enzyme bound FMN indicates 1alpha addition at the steroid C2 atom. These studies rule out lateral motion of the steroid and indicate that the steroid orientation is "flipped" in different redox states of the enzyme.
8951384	Mapping the functional surface of insulin by design: structure and function of a novel A-chain analogue.	Functional surfaces of a protein are often mapped by combination of X-ray crystallography and mutagenesis. Such studies of insulin have yielded paradoxical results, suggesting that the native state is inactive and reorganizes on receptor binding. Of particular interest is the N-terminal alpha-helix of the A-chain. Does this segment function as an alpha-helix or reorganize as recently proposed in a prohormone-convertase complex? To correlate structure and function, we describe a mapping strategy based on protein design. The solution structure of an engineered monomer ([AspB10, LysB28, ProB29]-human insulin) is determined at neutral pH as a template for synthesis of a novel A-chain analogue. Designed by analogy to a protein-folding intermediate, the analogue lacks the A6-A11 disulphide bridge; the cysteine residues are replaced by serine. Its solution structure is remarkable for segmental unfolding of the N-terminal A-chain alpha-helix (A1 to A8) in an otherwise native subdomain. The structure demonstrates that the overall orientation of the A and B chains is consistent with reorganization of the A-chain's N-terminal segment. Nevertheless, the analogue's low biological activity suggests that this segment, a site of clinical mutation causing diabetes mellitus, functions as a preformed recognition alpha-helix.
9010773	The structure, stability, and folding process of amyloidogenic mutant human lysozyme.	The physicochemical properties of an amyloidogenic mutant human lysozyme (Ile56Thr) were examined in order to elucidate the mechanism of amyloid formation. The crystal structure of the mutant protein was the same as the wild-type structure, except that the hydroxyl group of the introduced Thr56 formed a hydrogen bond with a water molecule in the interior of the protein. The other physicochemical properties of the mutant protein in the native state were not different from those of the wild-type protein. However, the equilibrium and kinetic stabilities of the mutant protein were remarkably decreased due to the introduction of a polar residue (Thr) in the interior of the molecule. It can be concluded that the amyloid formation of the mutant human lysozyme is due to a tendency to favor (partly or/and completely) denatured structures.
14559966	Crystal structure of the tyrosine kinase domain of the hepatocyte growth factor receptor c-Met and its complex with the microbial alkaloid K-252a.	The protooncogene c-met codes for the hepatocyte growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase. Binding of its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor, stimulates receptor autophosphorylation, which leads to pleiotropic downstream signaling events in epithelial cells, including cell growth, motility, and invasion. These events are mediated by interaction of cytoplasmic effectors, generally through Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, with two phosphotyrosine-containing sequence motifs in the unique C-terminal tail of c-Met (supersite). There is a strong link between aberrant c-Met activity and oncogenesis, which makes this kinase an important cancer drug target. The furanosylated indolocarbazole K-252a belongs to a family of microbial alkaloids that also includes staurosporine. It was recently shown to be a potent inhibitor of c-Met. Here we report the crystal structures of an unphosphorylated c-Met kinase domain harboring a human cancer mutation and its complex with K-252a at 1.8-A resolution. The structure follows the well established architecture of protein kinases. It adopts a unique, inhibitory conformation of the activation loop, a catalytically noncompetent orientation of helix alphaC, and reveals the complete C-terminal docking site. The first SH2-binding motif (1349YVHV) adopts an extended conformation, whereas the second motif (1356YVNV), a binding site for Grb2-SH2, folds as a type II Beta-turn. The intermediate portion of the supersite (1353NATY) assumes a type I Beta-turn conformation as in an Shc-phosphotyrosine binding domain peptide complex. K-252a is bound in the adenosine pocket with an analogous binding mode to those observed in previously reported structures of protein kinases in complex with staurosporine.
14523232	Mechanism and energetics of green fluorescent protein chromophore synthesis revealed by trapped intermediate structures.	Green fluorescent protein has revolutionized cell labeling and molecular tagging, yet the driving force and mechanism for its spontaneous fluorophore synthesis are not established. Here we discover mutations that substantially slow the rate but not the yield of this posttranslational modification, determine structures of the trapped precyclization intermediate and oxidized postcyclization states, and identify unanticipated features critical to chromophore maturation. The protein architecture contains a dramatic approximately 80 degrees bend in the central helix, which focuses distortions at G67 to promote ring formation from amino acids S65, Y66, and G67. Significantly, these distortions eliminate potential helical hydrogen bonds that would otherwise have to be broken at an energetic cost during peptide cyclization and force the G67 nitrogen and S65 carbonyl oxygen atoms within van der Waals contact in preparation for covalent bond formation. Further, we determine that under aerobic, but not anaerobic, conditions the Gly-Gly-Gly chromophore sequence cyclizes and incorporates an oxygen atom. These results lead directly to a conjugation-trapping mechanism, in which a thermodynamically unfavorable cyclization reaction is coupled to an electronic conjugation trapping step, to drive chromophore maturation. Moreover, we propose primarily electrostatic roles for the R96 and E222 side chains in chromophore formation and suggest that the T62 carbonyl oxygen is the base that initiates the dehydration reaction. Our molecular mechanism provides the basis for understanding and eventually controlling chromophore creation.
2276482	Combined familial hyperlipidaemia in association with apolipoprotein E3 phenotype.	null
9609690	A mutational analysis of binding interactions in an antigen-antibody protein-protein complex.	Alanine scanning mutagenesis, double mutant cycles, and X-ray crystallography were used to characterize the interface between the anti-hen egg white lysozyme (HEL) antibody D1.3 and HEL. Twelve out of the 13 nonglycine contact residues on HEL, as determined by the high-resolution crystal structure of the D1.3-HEL complex, were individually truncated to alanine. Only four positions showed a DeltaDeltaG (DeltaGmutant - DeltaGwild-type) of greater than 1.0 kcal/mol, with HEL residue Gln121 proving the most critical for binding (DeltaDeltaG = 2.9 kcal/mol). These residues form a contiguous patch at the periphery of the epitope recognized by D1.3. To understand how potentially disruptive mutations in the antigen are accommodated in the D1.3-HEL interface, we determined the crystal structure to 1.5 A resolution of the complex between D1.3 and HEL mutant Asp18 --> Ala. This mutation results in a DeltaDeltaG of only 0.3 kcal/mol, despite the loss of a hydrogen bond and seven van der Waals contacts to the Asp18 side chain. The crystal structure reveals that three additional water molecules are stably incorporated in the antigen-antibody interface at the site of the mutation. These waters help fill the cavity created by the mutation and form part of a rearranged solvent network linking the two proteins. To further dissect the energetics of specific interactions in the D1.3-HEL interface, double mutant cycles were carried out to measure the coupling of 14 amino acid pairs, 10 of which are in direct contact in the crystal structure. The highest coupling energies, 2.7 and 2.0 kcal/mol, were measured between HEL residue Gln121 and D1.3 residues VLTrp92 and VLTyr32, respectively. The interaction between Gln121 and VLTrp92 consists of three van der Waals contacts, while the interaction of Gln121 with VLTyr32 is mediated by a hydrogen bond. Surprisingly, however, most cycles between interface residues in direct contact in the crystal structure showed no significant coupling. In particular, a number of hydrogen-bonded residue pairs were found to make no net contribution to complex stabilization. We attribute these results to accessibility of the mutation sites to water, such that the mutated residues exchange their interaction with each other to interact with water. This implies that the strength of the protein-protein hydrogen bonds in these particular cases is comparable to that of the protein-water hydrogen bonds they replace. Thus, the simple fact that two residues are in direct contact in a protein-protein interface cannot be taken as evidence that there necessarily exists a productive interaction between them. Rather, the majority of such contacts may be energetically neutral, as in the D1.3-HEL complex.
9649316	Contribution of hydrogen bonds to the conformational stability of human lysozyme: calorimetry and X-ray analysis of six tyrosine --> phenylalanine mutants.	The contribution of hydrogen bonds to the conformational stability of human lysozyme was investigated by the combination of calorimetric and X-ray analyses of six Tyr --> Phe mutants. Unfolding Delta G and unfolding Delta H values of the Tyr --> Phe mutant proteins were changed by from +0.3 to -4.0 kJ/mol and from 0 to -16 kJ/mol, respectively, compared to those of the wild-type protein. The net contribution of a hydrogen bond at a specific site to stability (Delta Gwild/HB), considering factors affected by substitutions, was evaluated on the basis of X-ray structures of the mutant proteins. In the present study, one of six mutant proteins was suitable for evaluating the strength of the hydrogen bond. Delta Gwild/HB for the intramolecular hydrogen bond at Tyr124 was evaluated to be 7.5 kJ/mol. Results of the analysis of other mutants also suggest that hydrogen bonds of the hydroxyl group of Tyr, including the hydrogen bond with a water molecule, contribute to the stabilization of the human lysozyme.
11042604	Evaluating hydrogen-bond donor strength.	A parameter that measures hydrogen-bond donor (HBD) strength of solutes is useful in modeling many biological interactions. The solvents octanol and chloroform, have about equal HBD strength and thus will accommodate the hydrogen-bond acceptor (HBA) groups in solutes about equally well. Because the solvent octanol has a strong acceptor oxygen, solutes with HBD groups will favor it over chloroform on that basis. With its eight alkane carbons, octanol also favors solutes with a significant amount of alkane character, a property referred to in this paper as 'excess alkane affinity' (XAA). On the other hand, it is easier to form a cavity in the solvent chloroform, so larger solutes tend to favor that solvent. After allowing for XAA and molecular volume, the difference between log P(oct) and log P(clf) is a measure of the effective sum of HBD. This value is given the symbol epsilonalpha and appears to be on the same scale as Abraham's summation operatoralpha(2)(H).
16316975	Separate ion pathways in a Cl-/H+ exchanger.	CLC-ec1 is a prokaryotic CLC-type Cl(-)/H+ exchange transporter. Little is known about the mechanism of H+ coupling to Cl-. A critical glutamate residue, E148, was previously shown to be required for Cl(-)/H+ exchange by mediating proton transfer between the protein and the extracellular solution. To test whether an analogous H+ acceptor exists near the intracellular side of the protein, we performed a mutagenesis scan of inward-facing carboxyl-bearing residues and identified E203 as the unique residue whose neutralization abolishes H+ coupling to Cl- transport. Glutamate at this position is strictly conserved in all known CLCs of the transporter subclass, while valine is always found here in CLC channels. The x-ray crystal structure of the E203Q mutant is similar to that of the wild-type protein. Cl- transport rate in E203Q is inhibited at neutral pH, and the double mutant, E148A/E203Q, shows maximal Cl- transport, independent of pH, as does the single mutant E148A. The results argue that substrate exchange by CLC-ec1 involves two separate but partially overlapping permeation pathways, one for Cl- and one for H+. These pathways are congruent from the protein's extracellular surface to E148, and they diverge beyond this point toward the intracellular side. This picture demands a transport mechanism fundamentally different from familiar alternating-access schemes.
12056894	Organization of an efficient carbonic anhydrase: implications for the mechanism based on structure-function studies of a T199P/C206S mutant.	Substitution of Pro for Thr199 in the active site of human carbonic anhydrase II (HCA II)(1) reduces its catalytic efficiency about 3000-fold. X-ray crystallographic structures of the T199P/C206S variant have been determined in complex with the substrate bicarbonate and with the inhibitors thiocyanate and beta-mercaptoethanol. The latter molecule is normally not an inhibitor of wild-type HCA II. All three ligands display novel binding interactions to the T199P/C206S mutant. The beta-mercaptoethanol molecule binds in the active site area with its sulfur atom tetrahedrally coordinated to the zinc ion. Thiocyanate binds tetrahedrally coordinated to the zinc ion in T199P/C206S, in contrast to its pentacoordinated binding to the zinc ion in wild-type HCA II. Bicarbonate binds to the mutant with two of its oxygens at the positions of the zinc water (Wat263) and Wat318 in wild-type HCA II. The environment of this area is more hydrophilic than the normal bicarbonate-binding site of HCA II situated in the hydrophobic part of the cavity normally occupied by the so-called deep water (Wat338). The observation of a new binding site for bicarbonate has implications for understanding the mechanism by which the main-chain amino group of Thr199 acquired an important role for orientation of the substrate during the evolution of the enzyme.
1931963	Structural basis for broad specificity in alpha-lytic protease mutants.	Binding pocket mutants of alpha-lytic protease (Met 192----Ala and Met 213----Ala) have been constructed recently in an effort to create a protease specific for Met just prior to the scissile bond. Instead, mutation resulted in proteases with extraordinarily broad specificity profiles and high activity [Bone, R., Silen, J. L., & Agard, D. A. (1989) Nature 339, 191-195]. To understand the structural basis for the unexpected specificity profiles of these mutants, high-resolution X-ray crystal structures have been determined for complexes of each mutant with a series of systematically varying peptidylboronic acids. These inhibitory analogues of high-energy reaction intermediates provide models for how substrates with different side chains interact with the enzyme during the transition state. Fifteen structures have been analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively with respect to enzyme-inhibitor hydrogen-bond lengths, buried hydrophobic surface area, unfilled cavity volume, and the magnitude of inhibitor accommodating conformational adjustments (particularly in the region of another binding pocket residue, Val 217A). Comparison of these four parameters with the Ki of each inhibitor and the kcat and Km of the analogous substrates indicates that while no single structural parameter consistently correlates with activity or inhibition, the observed data can be understood as a combination of effects. Furthermore, the relative contribution of each term differs for the three enzymes, reflecting the altered conformational energetics of each mutant. From the extensive structural analysis, it is clear that enzyme flexibility, especially in the region of Val 217A, is primarily responsible for the exceptionally broad specificity observed in either mutant. Taken together, the observed patterns of substrate specificity can be understood to arise directly from interactions between the substrate and the residues lining the specificity pocket and indirectly from interactions between peripheral regions of the protein and the active-site region that serve to modulate active-site flexibility.
15299479	Crystal structure of chloromuconate cycloisomerase from Alcaligenes eutrophus JMP134 (pJP4) at 3 A resolution.	Chloromuconate cycloisomerase (E.C. 5.5.1.7) is an enzyme involved in the 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate degradation pathway of Alcaligenes eutrophus JMP134 (pJP4). The crystal structure of this protein was determined at 3 A resolution by molecular-replacement techniques using atomic coordinates from the reported crystal structure of the homologous muconate cycloisomerase (E.C. 5.5.1.1) from Pseudomonas putida as the search model (42% identical positions in the sequences). Structure refinement by simulated-annealing and restrained least-squares techniques converged at R = 0.195. In the crystals studied, space group I4, the protein is present as two octamers per unit cell with two subunits per asymmetric unit. Each subunit consists of two globular domains, one of which forms an alpha/beta-barrel. Comparison of this structure with that of muconate cycloisomerase reveals the reasons for the altered substrate specificity of chloromuconate cycloisomerase. Marked differences are observed in polarity, accessibility and hydrogen-bonding potential in the channel leading into the active site as well as in the active center itself.
8880915	Coupling between trans/cis proline isomerization and protein stability in staphylococcal nuclease.	The nucleases A produced by two strains of Staphylococcus aureus, which have different stabilities, differ only in the identity of the single amino acid at residue 124. The nuclease from the Foggi strain of S. aureus (by convention nuclease WT), which contains His124, is 1.9 kcal.mol-1 less stable (at pH 5.5 and 20 degrees C) than the nuclease from the V8 strain (by convention nuclease H124L), which contains Leu124. In addition, the population of the trans conformer at the Lys116-Pro117 peptide bond, as observed by NMR spectroscopy, is different for the two variants: about 15% for nuclease WT and 9% for nuclease H124L. In order to improve our understanding of the origin of these differences, we compared the properties of WT and H124L with those of the H124A and H124I variants. We discovered a correlation between effects of different residues at this position on protein stability and on stabilization of the cis configuration of the Lys116-Pro117 peptide bond. In terms of free energy, approximately 17% of the increase in protein stability manifests itself as stabilization of the cis configuration at Lys116-Pro117. This result implies that the differences in stability arise mainly from structural differences between the cis configurational isomers at Pro117 of the different variants at residue 124. We solved the X-ray structure of the cis form of the most stable variant, H124L, and compared it with the published high-resolution X-ray structure of the cis form of the most stable variant, WT (Hynes TR, Fox RO, 1991, Proteins Struct Funct Genet 10:92-105). The two structures are identical within experimental error, except for the side chain at residue 124, which is exposed in the models of both variants. Thus, the increased stability and changes in the trans/cis equilibrium of the Lys116-Pro117 peptide bond observed in H124L relative to WT are due to subtle structural changes that are not observed by current structure determination technique. Residue 124 is located in a helix. However, the stability changes are too large and follow the wrong order of stability to be explained simply by differences in helical propensity. A second site of conformational heterogeneity in native nuclease is found at the His46-Pro47 peptide bond, which is approximately 80% trans in both WT and H124L. Because proline to glycine substitutions at either residue 47 or 117 remove the structural heterogeneity at that position and increase protein stability, we determined the X-ray structures of H124L + P117G and H124L + P47G + P117G and the kinetic parameters of H124L, H124L + P47G, H124L + P117G, and H124L + P47G + P117G. The individual P117G and P47G mutations cause decreases in nuclease activity, with kcat affected more than Km, and their effects are additive. The P117G mutation in nuclease H124L leads to the same local conformational rearrangement described for the P117G mutant of WT (Hynes TR, Hodel A, Fox RO, 1994, Biochemistry 33:5021-5030). In both P117G mutants, the loop formed by residues 112-117 is located closer to the adjacent loop formed by residues 77-85, and residues 115-118 adopt a type I' beta-turn conformation with the Lys116-Gly117 peptide bond in the trans configuration, as compared with the parent protein in which these residues have a typeVIa beta-turn conformation with the Lys116-Pro117 peptide bond in the cis configuration. Addition of the P47G mutation appears not to cause any additional structural changes. However, the electron density for part of the loop containing this peptide bond was not strong enough to be interpreted.
8805568	Structure of unliganded HIV-1 reverse transcriptase at 2.7 A resolution: implications of conformational changes for polymerization and inhibition mechanisms.	BACKGROUND: HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) is a major target for anti-HIV drugs. A considerable amount of information about the structure of RT is available, both unliganded and in complex with template-primer or non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs). But significant conformational differences in the p66 polymerase domain among the unliganded structures have complicated the interpretation of these data, leading to different proposals for the mechanisms of polymerization and inhibition. RESULTS: We report the structure of an unliganded RT at 2.7 A resolution, crystallized in space group C2 with a crystal packing similar to that of the RT-NNRTI complexes. The p66 thumb subdomain is folded into the DNA-binding cleft. Comparison of the unliganded RT structures with the DNA-bound RT and the NNRTI-bound RT structures reveals that the p66 thumb subdomain can exhibit two different upright conformations. In the DNA-bound RT, the p66 thumb subdomain adopts an upright position that can be described as resulting from a rigid-body rotation of the p66 thumb along the "thumb's knuckle' located near residues Trp239 (in strand beta 14) and Val317 (in beta 15) compared with the thumb position in the unliganded RT structure. NNRTI binding induces an additional hinge movement of the p66 thumb near the thumb's knuckle, causing the p66 thumb to adopt a configuration that is even more extended than in the DNA-bound RT structure. CONCLUSIONS: The p66 thumb subdomain is extremely flexible. NNRTI binding induces both short-range and long-range structural distortions in several domains of RT, which are expected to alter the position and conformation of the template-primer. These changes may account for the inhibition of polymerization and the alteration of the cleavage specificity of RNase H by NNRTI binding.
16221761	Structure and metal-dependent mechanism of peptidoglycan deacetylase, a streptococcal virulence factor.	Streptococcus pneumoniae peptidoglycan GlcNAc deacetylase (SpPgdA) protects the Gram-positive bacterial cell wall from host lysozymes by deacetylating peptidoglycan GlcNAc residues. Deletion of the pgda gene has been shown to result in hypersensitivity to lysozyme and reduction of infectivity in a mouse model. SpPgdA is a member of the family 4 carbohydrate esterases, for which little structural information exists, and no catalytic mechanism has yet been defined. Here we describe the native crystal structure and product complexes of SpPgdA biochemical characterization and mutagenesis. The structural data show that SpPgdA is an elongated three-domain protein in the crystal. The structure, in combination with mutagenesis, shows that SpPgdA is a metalloenzyme using a His-His-Asp zinc-binding triad with a nearby aspartic acid and histidine acting as the catalytic base and acid, respectively, somewhat similar to other zinc deacetylases such as LpxC. The enzyme is able to accept GlcNAc(3) as a substrate (K(m) = 3.8 mM, k(cat) = 0.55 s(-1)), with the N-acetyl of the middle sugar being removed by the enzyme. The data described here show that SpPgdA and the other family 4 carbohydrate esterases are metalloenzymes and present a step toward identification of mechanism-based inhibitors for this important class of enzymes.
9179777	Crystal structure of the bovine alpha-chymotrypsin:Kunitz inhibitor complex. An example of multiple protein:protein recognition sites.	The crystal structure of bovine alpha-chymotrypsin (alpha-CHT) in complex with the bovine basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) has been solved and refined at 2.8 A resolution (R-factor = 0.18). The proteinase:inhibitor complex forms a compact dimer (two alpha-CHT and two BPTI molecules), which may be stabilized by surface-bound sulphate ions, in the crystalline state. Each BPTI molecule, at opposite ends, is contacting both proteinase molecules in the dimer, through the reactive site loop and through residues next to the inhibitor's C-terminal region. Specific recognition between alpha-CHT and BPTI occurs at the (re)active site interface according to structural rules inferred from the analysis of homologous serine proteinase:inhibitor complexes. Lys15, the P1 residue of BPTI, however, does not occupy the alpha-CHT S1 specificity pocket, being hydrogen bonded to backbone atoms of the enzyme surface residues Gly216 and Ser217.
11349148	Structural mechanism for statin inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase.	HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A) reductase (HMGR) catalyzes the committed step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Statins are HMGR inhibitors with inhibition constant values in the nanomolar range that effectively lower serum cholesterol levels and are widely prescribed in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. We have determined structures of the catalytic portion of human HMGR complexed with six different statins. The statins occupy a portion of the binding site of HMG-CoA, thus blocking access of this substrate to the active site. Near the carboxyl terminus of HMGR, several catalytically relevant residues are disordered in the enzyme-statin complexes. If these residues were not flexible, they would sterically hinder statin binding.
12652322	Substrate-induced transmembrane signaling in the cobalamin transporter BtuB.	The outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria possess transport proteins essential for uptake of scarce nutrients. In TonB-dependent transporters, a conserved sequence of seven residues, the Ton box, faces the periplasm and interacts with the inner membrane TonB protein to energize an active transport cycle. A critical mechanistic step is the structural change in the Ton box of the transporter upon substrate binding; this essential transmembrane signaling event increases the affinity of the transporter for TonB and enables active transport to proceed. We have solved crystal structures of BtuB, the outer membrane cobalamin transporter from Escherichia coli, in the absence and presence of cyanocobalamin (vitamin B(12)). In these structures, the Ton box is ordered and undergoes a conformational change in the presence of bound substrate. Calcium has been implicated as a necessary factor for the high-affinity binding (K(d) approximately 0.3 nM) of cyanocobalamin to BtuB. We observe two bound calcium ions that order three extracellular loops of BtuB, thus providing a direct (and unusual) structural role for calcium.
9772165	Crystal structures of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase in complex with carboxanilide derivatives.	The carboxanilides are nonnucleoside inhibitors (NNIs) of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT), of potential clinical importance. The compounds differ in potency and in their retention of potency in the face of drug resistance mutations. Whereas UC-84, the prototype compound, only weakly inhibits many RTs bearing single point resistance mutations, inhibition by UC-781 is little affected. It has been proposed that UC-38 and UC-781 may form quaternary complexes with RT at a site other than the known binding pocket of other NNIs. X-ray crystal structures of four HIV-1 RT-carboxanilide complexes (UC-10, UC-38, UC-84, and UC-781) reported here reveal that all four inhibitors bind in the usual NNI site, forming binary 1:1 complexes with RT in the absence of substrates with the amide/thioamide bond in cis conformations. For all four complexes the anilide rings of the inhibitors overlap aromatic rings of many other NNIs bound to RT. In contrast, the second rings of UC-10, UC-84, and UC-781 do not bind in equivalent positions to those of other "two-ring" NNIs such as alpha-APA or HEPT derivatives. The binding modes most closely resemble that of the structurally dissimilar NNI, Cl-TIBO, with a common hydrogen bond between each carboxanilide NH- group and the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Lys101. The binding modes differ slightly between the UC-10/UC-781 and UC-38/UC-84 pairs of compounds, apparently related to the shorter isopropylmethanoyl substituents of the anilide rings of UC-38/UC-84, which draws these rings closer to residues Tyr181 and Tyr188. This in turn explains the differences in the effect of mutated residues on the binding of these compounds.
2215649	High specificity of a phosphate transport protein determined by hydrogen bonds.	Transport of the essential nutrient phosphorus--primarily in the form of orthophosphate--into cells and organelles is highly specific. This is exemplified by the uptake of phosphate or its close analogue arsenate by bacterial cells by way of a high affinity active transport system dependent on a phosphate-binding protein; this system is unable to recognize other inorganic oxyanions and is, moreover, distinct from the one for sulphate transport. The phosphate-binding protein is a member of a family of periplasmic proteins acting as initial high-affinity receptors for the osmotic shock-sensitive active transport systems or permeases for various sugars, amino acids, oligopeptides, and oxyanions. We report here the highly refined 1.7 A resolution X-ray structure of the liganded form of the phosphate-binding protein. The structure reveals the atomic features responsible for phosphate selectivity, either in monobasic or dibasic form, and the exclusion of sulphate. These features are fundamental to understanding phosphate transport systems and molecular recognition of charged substrates or ions in other biological processes.
2156077	Analysis of the structure of a common cold virus, human rhinovirus 14, refined at a resolution of 3.0 A.	Human rhinovirus 14 has a pseudo T = 3 icosahedral structure in which 60 copies of the three larger capsid proteins VP1, VP2 and VP3 are arranged in an icosahedral surface lattice, reminiscent of T = 3 viruses such as tomato bushy stunt virus and southern bean mosaic virus. The overall secondary and tertiary structures of VP1, VP2 and VP3 are very similar. The structure of human rhinovirus 14, which was refined at a resolution of 3.0 A [R = 0.16 for reflections with F greater than 3 sigma(F)], is here analyzed in detail. Quantitative analysis of the surface areas of contact (proportional to hydrophobic free energy of association) supports the previously assigned arrangement within the promoter, in which interactions between VP1 and VP3 predominate. Major contacts among VP1, VP2 and VP3 are between the beta-barrel moieties. VP4 is associated with the capsid interior by a distributed network of contacts with VP1, VP2 and VP3 within a promoter. As the virion assembly proceeds, the solvent-accessible surface area becomes increasingly hydrophilic in character. A mixed parallel and antiparallel seven-stranded sheet is composed of the beta C, beta H, beta E and beta F strands of VP3 in one pentamer and beta A1 and beta A2 of VP2 and the VP1 amino terminus in another pentamer. This association plays an essential role in holding pentamers together in the mature virion as this contact region includes more than half of the total short non-bonded contacts between pentamers. Contacts between protomers within pentamers are more extensive than the contacts between pentamers, accounting in part for the stability of pentamers. The previously identified immunogenic regions are correlated with high solvent accessibility, accessibility to large probes and also high thermal parameters. Surface residues in the canyon, the putative cellular receptor recognition site, have lower thermal parameters than other portions of the human rhinovirus 14 surface. Many of the water molecules in the ordered solvent model are located at subunit interfaces. A number of unusual crevices exist in the protein shell of human rhinovirus 14, including the hydrophobic pocket in VP1 which is the locus of binding for the WIN antiviral agents. These may be required for conformational flexibility during assembly and disassembly. The structures of the beta-barrels of human rhinovirus 14 VP1, VP2 and VP3 are compared with each other and with the southern bean mosaic virus coat protein.
2611204	Structural analysis of specificity: alpha-lytic protease complexes with analogues of reaction intermediates.	To better understand the structural basis of enzyme specificity, the structures of complexes formed between alpha-lytic protease, an extracellular serine protease of Lysobacter enzymogenes, and five inhibitory peptide boronic acids (R2-boroX, where R2 is methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro- and boroX is the alpha-aminoboronic acid analogue of Ala, Val, Ile, Norleu, or Phe) have been studied at high resolution by X-ray crystallography. The enzyme has primary specificity for Ala in the P1 position of peptide substrates with catalytic efficiency decreasing with increasing side-chain volume. Enzyme affinity for inhibitors with boroVal, boroIle, and boroPhe residues is much higher than expected on the basis of the catalytic efficiencies of homologous substrates. Covalent tetrahedral adducts are formed between the active-site serine and the boronic acid moieties of R2-boroAla, R2-boroVal R2-boroIle, and R2-boroNorleu. Though R2-boroVal is a slowly bound inhibitor and R2-boroAla is rapidly bound [Kettner, C. A., Bone, R., Agard, D. A., & Bachovchin, W. W. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 7682-7688], there appear to be no structural differences that could account for slow binding. The removal from solution of 20% more hydrophobic surface on binding accounts for the improved affinity of alpha-lytic protease for R2-boroVal relative to R2-boroAla. The high affinity of the enzyme for R2-boroIle derives from the selective binding of the L-allo stereoisomer of the boroIle residue, which can avoid bad steric interactions in the binding pocket.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
15549494	Structural and biochemical implications of single amino acid substitutions in the nucleotide-dependent switch regions of the nitrogenase Fe protein from Azotobacter vinelandii.	The structures of nitrogenase Fe proteins with defined amino acid substitutions in the previously implicated nucleotide-dependent signal transduction pathways termed switch I and switch II have been determined by X-ray diffraction methods. In the Fe protein of nitrogenase the nucleotide-dependent switch regions are responsible for communication between the sites responsible for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis and the [4Fe-4S] cluster of the Fe protein and the docking interface that interacts with the MoFe protein upon macromolecular complex formation. In this study the structural characterization of the Azotobacter vinelandii nitrogenase Fe protein with Asp at position 39 substituted by Asn in MgADP-bound and nucleotide-free states provides an explanation for the experimental observation that the altered Fe proteins form a trapped complex subsequent to a single electron transfer event. The structures reveal that the substitution allows the formation of a hydrogen bond between the switch I Asn39 and the switch II Asp125. In the structure of the native enzyme the analogous interaction between the side chains of Asp39 and Asp125 is precluded due to electrostatic repulsion. These results suggest that the electrostatic repulsion between Asp39 and Asp125 is important for dissociation of the Fe protein:MoFe protein complex during catalysis. In a separate study, the structural characterization of the Fe protein with Asp129 substituted by Glu provides the structural basis for the observation that the Glu129-substituted variant in the absence of bound nucleotides has biochemical properties in common with the native Fe protein with bound MgADP. Interactions of the longer Glu side chain with the phosphate binding loop (P-loop) results in a similar conformation of the switch II region as the conformation that results from the binding of the phosphate of ADP to the P-loop.

8890910	X-ray structure of the ferredoxin:NADP+ reductase from the cyanobacterium Anabaena PCC 7119 at 1.8 A resolution, and crystallographic studies of NADP+ binding at 2.25 A resolution.	The crystal structure of the ferredoxin:NADP+ reductase (FNR) from the cyanobacterium Anabaena PCC 7119 has been determined at 2.6 A resolution by multiple isomorphous replacement and refined using 15.0 A to 1.8 A data, collected at 4 degrees C, to an R-factor of 0.172. The model includes 303 residues, the flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor (FAD), one sulfate ion located at the putative NADP+ binding site and 328 water molecule sites. The structure of Anabaena FNR, including FAD, a network of intrinsic water molecules and a large hydrophobic cavity in the C-terminal domain, resembles that of the spinach enzyme. The major differences concern the additional short alpha-helix (residues 172 to 177 in Anabaena FNR) and residues Arg 100 and Arg 233 which binds NADP+ instead of Lys 116 and Lys 244 in the spinach enzyme. Crystals of a complex of Anabaena FNR with NADP+ were obtained. The model of the complex has been refined using 15 A to 2.25 A X-ray data, collected at -170 degrees C, to an R-factor of 0.186. This model includes 295 residues, FAD, the full NADP+ (with an occupancy of 0.8) and 444 water molecules. The 2'-5' adenine moiety of NADP+ binds to the protein as 2'-phospho-5'-AMP to the spinach FNR. The nicotinamide moiety is turned towards the surface of the protein instead of stacking onto the FAD isoalloxazine ring as would be required for hydride transfer. The model of the complex agrees with previous biochemical studies as residues Arg 100 and Arg 233 are involved in NADP+ binding and residues Arg77, Lys 53 and Lys 294, located on the FAD side of the enzyme, remain free to interact with ferredoxin and flavodoxin, the physiological partners of ferredoxin: NADP reductase.
8702816	Structural and functional characterization of OmpF porin mutants selected for larger pore size. I. Crystallographic analysis.	OmpF porin is a nonspecific pore protein from the outer membrane of Escherichia coli. Previously, a set of mutants was selected that allow the passage of long maltodextrins that do not translocate through the wild-type pore. Here, we describe the crystal structures of four point mutants and one deletion mutant from this set; their functional characterization is reported in the accompanying paper (Saint, N., Lou, K.-L., Widmer, C., Luckey, M., Schirmer, T., Rosenbusch, J. P. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 20676-20680). All mutations have a local effect on the structure of the pore constriction and result in a larger pore cross-section. Substitution of each of the three closely packed arginine residues at the pore constriction (Arg-42, Arg-82, and Arg-132) by shorter uncharged residues causes rearrangement of the adjacent basic residues. This demonstrates mutual stabilization of these residues in the wild-type porin. Deletion of six residues from the internal loop (Delta109-114) results in disorder of seven adjacent residues but does not alter the structure of the beta-barrel framework. Thus, the large hollow beta-barrel motif can be regarded as an autonomous structure.
15296730	Crystal structures of a ligand-free and malonate-bound human caspase-1: implications for the mechanism of substrate binding.	Caspase-1, a mediator of the posttranslational processing of IL-1beta and IL-18, requires an aspartic acid in the P1 position of its substrates. The mechanisms of caspase-1 activation remain poorly understood despite numerous structures of the enzyme complexed with aspartate-based inhibitors. Here we report a crystal structure of ligand-free caspase-1 that displays dramatic rearrangements of loops defining the active site to generate a closed conformation that is incompatible with substrate binding. A structure of the enzyme complexed with malonate shows the protein in its open (active-site ligand-bound) conformation in which malonate reproduces the hydrogen bonding network observed in structures with covalent inhibitors. These results illustrate the essential function of the obligatory aspartate recognition element that opens the active site of caspase-1 to substrates and may be the determinant responsible for the conformational changes between ligand-free and -bound forms of the enzyme, and suggest a new approach for identifying novel aspartic acid mimetics.

11106484	High-resolution structure of the HNF-1alpha dimerization domain.	The N-terminal dimerization domain of the transcriptional activator hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha) is essential for DNA binding and association of the transcriptional coactivator, DCoH (dimerization cofactor of HNF-1). To investigate the basis for dimerization of HNF-1 proteins, we determined the 1.2 A resolution X-ray crystal structure of the dimerization domain of HNF-1alpha (HNF-p1). Phasing was facilitated by devising a simple synthesis for Fmoc-selenomethionine and substituting leucine residues with selenomethionine. The HNF-1 dimerization domain forms a unique, four-helix bundle that is preserved with localized conformational shifts in the DCoH complex. In three different crystal forms, HNF-p1 displays subtle shifts in the conformation of the interhelix loop and the crossing angle between the amino- and carboxyl-terminal helices. In all three crystal forms, the HNF-p1 dimers pair through an exposed hydrophobic surface that also forms the binding site for DCoH. Conserved core residues in the dimerization domain of the homologous transcriptional regulator HNF-1beta rationalize the functional heterodimerization of the HNF-1alpha and HNF-1beta proteins. Mutations in HNF-1alpha are associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3), and the structure of HNF-p1 provides insights into the effects of three MODY3 mutations.
10537112	Structural evidence for dimerization-regulated activation of an integral membrane phospholipase.	Dimerization is a biological regulatory mechanism employed by both soluble and membrane proteins. However, there are few structural data on the factors that govern dimerization of membrane proteins. Outer membrane phospholipase A (OMPLA) is an integral membrane enzyme which participates in secretion of colicins in Escherichia coli. In Campilobacter and Helicobacter pylori strains, OMPLA is implied in virulence. Its activity is regulated by reversible dimerization. Here we report X-ray structures of monomeric and dimeric OMPLA from E. coli. Dimer interactions occur almost exclusively in the apolar membrane-embedded parts, with two hydrogen bonds within the hydrophobic membrane area being key interactions. Dimerization results in functional oxyanion holes and substrate-binding pockets, which are absent in monomeric OMPLA. These results provide a detailed view of activation by dimerization of a membrane protein.
12205096	Crystal structure of ClpA, an Hsp100 chaperone and regulator of ClpAP protease.	Escherichia coli ClpA, an Hsp100/Clp chaperone and an integral component of the ATP-dependent ClpAP protease, participates in regulatory protein degradation and the dissolution and degradation of protein aggregates. The crystal structure of the ClpA subunit reveals an N-terminal domain with pseudo-twofold symmetry and two AAA(+) modules (D1 and D2) each consisting of a large and a small sub-domain with ADP bound in the sub-domain junction. The N-terminal domain interacts with the D1 domain in a manner similar to adaptor-binding domains of other AAA(+) proteins. D1 and D2 are connected head-to-tail consistent with a cooperative and vectorial translocation of protein substrates. In a planar hexamer model of ClpA, built by assembling ClpA D1 and D2 into homohexameric rings of known structures of AAA(+) modules, the differences in D1-D1 and D2-D2 interfaces correlate with their respective contributions to hexamer stability and ATPase activity.
7542140	Structure of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase in a complex with the non-nucleoside inhibitor alpha-APA R 95845 at 2.8 A resolution.	BACKGROUND: HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) is a multifunctional enzyme that copies the RNA genome of HIV-1 into DNA. It is a heterodimer composed of a 66 kDa (p66) and a 51 kDa (p51) subunit. HIV-1 RT is a crucial target for structure-based drug design, and potent inhibitors have been identified, whose efficacy, however, is limited by drug resistance. RESULTS: The crystal structure of HIV-1 RT in complex with the non-nucleoside inhibitor alpha-anilinophenyl-acetamide (alpha-APA) R95845 has been determined at 2.8 A resolution. The inhibitor binds in a hydrophobic pocket near the polymerase active site. The pocket contains five aromatic amino acid residues and the interactions of the side chains of these residues with the aromatic rings of non-nucleoside inhibitors appear to be important for inhibitor binding. Most of the amino acid residues where mutations have been correlated with high levels of resistance to non-nucleoside inhibitors of HIV-1 RT are located close to alpha-APA. The overall fold of HIV-1 RT in complex with alpha-APA is similar to that found when in complex with nevirapine, another non-nucleoside inhibitor, but there are significant conformational changes relative to an HIV-1 RT/DNA/Fab complex. CONCLUSIONS: The non-nucleoside inhibitor-binding pocket has a flexible structure whose mobility may be required for effective polymerization, and may be part of a hinge that permits relative movements of two subdomains of the p66 subunit denoted the 'palm' and 'thumb'. An understanding of the structure of the inhibitor-binding pocket, of the interactions between HIV-1 RT and alpha-APA, and of the locations of mutations that confer resistance to inhibitors provides a basis for structure-based design of chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of AIDS.
16483931	Structural and mechanistic insights into ras association domains of phospholipase C epsilon.	Ras proteins signal to a number of distinct pathways by interacting with diverse effectors. Studies of ras/effector interactions have focused on three classes, Raf kinases, ral guanylnucleotide-exchange factors, and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases. Here we describe ras interactions with another effector, the recently identified phospholipase C epsilon (PLCepsilon). We solved structures of PLCepsilon RA domains (RA1 and RA2) by NMR and the structure of the RA2/ras complex by X-ray crystallography. Although the similarity between ubiquitin-like folds of RA1 and RA2 proves that they are homologs, only RA2 can bind ras. Some of the features of the RA2/ras interface are unique to PLCepsilon, while the ability to make contacts with both switch I and II regions of ras is shared only with phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase. Studies of PLCepsilon regulation suggest that, in a cellular context, the RA2 domain, in a mode specific to PLCepsilon, has a role in membrane targeting with further regulatory impact on PLC activity.
3476160	Protein engineering of subtilisin BPN': enhanced stabilization through the introduction of two cysteines to form a disulfide bond.	Introduction of a disulfide bond by site-directed mutagenesis was found to enhance the stability of subtilisin BPN' (EC 3.4.21.14) under a variety of conditions. The location of the new disulfide bond was selected with the aid of a computer program, which scored various sites according to the amount of distortion that an introduced disulfide linkage would create in a 1.3-A X-ray model of native subtilisin BPN'. Of the several amino acid pairs identified by this program as suitable candidates, Thr-22 and Ser-87 were selected by using the additional requirement that the individual cysteine substitutions occur at positions that exhibit some degree of variability in related subtilisin amino acid sequences. A subtilisin variant containing cysteine residues at positions 22 and 87 was created by site-directed mutagenesis and was shown to have an activity essentially equivalent to that of the wild-type enzyme. Differential scanning calorimetry experiments demonstrated the variant protein to have a melting temperature 3.1 degrees C higher than that of the wild-type protein and 5.8 degrees C higher than that of the reduced form (-SH HS-) of the variant protein. Kinetic experiments performed under a variety of conditions, including 8 M urea, showed that the Cys-22/Cys-87 disulfide variant undergoes thermal inactivation at half the rate of that of the wild-type enzyme. The increased thermal stability of this disulfide variant is consistent with a decrease in entropy for the unfolded state relative to the unfolded state that contains no cross-link, as would be predicted from the statistical thermodynamics of polymers.
12501175	The crystal structure of the H48Q active site mutant of human group IIA secreted phospholipase A2 at 1.5 A resolution provides an insight into the catalytic mechanism.	The human group IIA secreted PLA(2) is a 14 kDa calcium-dependent extracellular enzyme that has been characterized as an acute phase protein with important antimicrobial activity and has been implicated in signal transduction. The selective binding of this enzyme to the phospholipid substrate interface plays a crucial role in its physiological function. To study interfacial binding in the absence of catalysis, one strategy is to produce structurally intact but catalytically inactive mutants. The active site mutants H48Q, H48N, and H48A had been prepared for the secreted PLA(2)s from bovine pancreas and bee venom and retained minimal catalytic activity while the H48Q mutant showed the maximum structural integrity. Preparation of the mutant H48Q of the human group IIA enzyme unexpectedly produced an enzyme that retained significant (2-4%) catalytic activity that was contrary to expectations in view of the accepted catalytic mechanism. In this paper it is established that the high residual activity of the H48Q mutant is genuine, not due to contamination, and can be seen under a variety of assay conditions including assays in the presence of Co(2+) and Ni(2+) in place of Ca(2+). The crystallization of the H48Q mutant, yielding diffraction data to a resolution of 1.5 A, allowed a comparison with the corresponding recombinant wild-type enzyme (N1A) that was also crystallized. This comparison revealed that all of the important features of the catalytic machinery were in place and the two structures were virtually superimposable. In particular, the catalytic calcium ion occupied an identical position in the active site of the two proteins, and the catalytic water molecule (w6) was clearly resolved in the H48Q mutant. We propose that a variation of the calcium-coordinated oxyanion ("two water") mechanism involving hydrogen bonding rather than the anticipated full proton transfer to the histidine will best explain the ability of an active site glutamine to allow significant catalytic activity.
12083921	Pentalenene synthase. Analysis of active site residues by site-directed mutagenesis.	Incubation of farnesyl diphosphate (1) with the W308F or W308F/H309F mutants of pentalenene synthase, an enzyme from Streptomyces UC5319, yielded pentalenene (2), accompanied by varying proportions of (+)-germacrene A (7) with relatively minor changes in k(cat) and k(cat)/K(m). By contrast, single H309 mutants gave rise to both (+)-germacrene A (7) and protoilludene (8) in addition to pentalenene (2). Mutation to glutamate of each of the three aspartate residues in the Mg(2+)-binding aspartate-rich domain, (80)DDLFD, resulted in reduction in the k(cat)/K(m) for farnesyl diphosphate and formation of varying proportions of pentalenene and (+)-germacrene A (7). Formation of (+)-germacrene A (7) by the various pentalenene synthase mutants is the result of a derailment of the natural anti-Markovnikov cyclization reaction, and not simply the consequence of trapping of a normally cryptic, carbocationic intermediate. Both the N219A and N219L mutants of pentalenene synthase were completely inactive, while the corresponding N219D mutant had a k(cat)/K(m) which was 3300-fold lower than that of the wild-type synthase, and produced a mixture of pentalenene (2) (91%) and the aberrant cyclization product beta-caryophyllene (9) (9%). Finally, the F77Y mutant had a k(cat)/K(m) which was reduced by 20-fold compared to that of the wild-type synthase.
9032071	The crystal structure of the flavin containing enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase A from Lactococcus lactis.	BACKGROUND:. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHOD) is a flavin mononucleotide containing enzyme, which catalyzes the oxidation of (S)-dihydroorotate to orotate, the fourth step in the de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides. Lactococcus lactis contains two genes encoding different functional DHODs whose sequences are only 30% identical. One of these enzymes, DHODA, is a highly efficient dimer, while the other, DHODB, shows optimal activity only in the presence of an iron-sulphur cluster containing protein with which it forms a complex tetramer. Sequence alignments have identified three different families among the DHODs: the two L. lactis enzymes belong to two of the families, whereas the enzyme from E. coli is a representative of the third. As no three-dimensional structures of DHODs are currently available, we set out to determine the crystal structure of DHODA from L. lactis. The differences between the two L. lactis enzymes make them particularly interesting for studying flavoprotein redox reactions and for identifying the differences between the enzyme families. RESULTS:. The crystal structure of DHODA has been determined to 2.0  resolution. The enzyme is a dimer of two crystallographically independent molecules related by a non-crystallographic twofold axis. The protein folds into and alpha/beta barrel with the flavin molecule sitting between the top of the barrel and a subdomain formed by several barrel inserts. Above the flavin isoalloxazine ring there is a small water filled cavity, completely buried beneath the protein surface and surrounded by many conserved residues. This cavity is proposed as the substrate-binding site. CONCLUSIONS:. The crystal structure has allowed the function of many of the conserved residues in DHODs to be identified: many of these are associated with binding the flavin group. Important differences were identified in some of the active-site residues which vary across the distinct DHOD families, implying significant mechanistic differences. The substrate cavity, although buried, is located beneath a highly conserved loop which is much less ordered than the rest of the protein and may be important in giving access to the cavity. The location of the conserved residues surrounding this cavity suggests the potential orientation of the substrate.
11980702	Three-dimensional structure of the human transglutaminase 3 enzyme: binding of calcium ions changes structure for activation.	Transglutaminase (TGase) enzymes catalyze the formation of covalent cross-links between protein-bound glutamines and lysines in a calcium-dependent manner, but the role of Ca(2+) ions remains unclear. The TGase 3 isoform is widely expressed and is important for epithelial barrier formation. It is a zymogen, requiring proteolysis for activity. We have solved the three-dimensional structures of the zymogen and the activated forms at 2.2 and 2.1 A resolution, respectively, and examined the role of Ca(2+) ions. The zymogen binds one ion tightly that cannot be exchanged. Upon proteolysis, the enzyme exothermally acquires two more Ca(2+) ions that activate the enzyme, are exchangeable and are functionally replaceable by other lanthanide trivalent cations. Binding of a Ca(2+) ion at one of these sites opens a channel which exposes the key Trp236 and Trp327 residues that control substrate access to the active site. Together, these biochemical and structural data reveal for the first time in a TGase enzyme that Ca(2+) ions induce structural changes which at least in part dictate activity and, moreover, may confer substrate specificity.
10429209	Structural and kinetic analysis of drug resistant mutants of HIV-1 protease.	Mutants of HIV-1 protease that are commonly selected on exposure to different drugs, V82S, G48V, N88D and L90M, showed reduced catalytic activity compared to the wild-type protease on cleavage site peptides, CA-p2, p6pol-PR and PR-RT, critical for viral maturation. Mutant V82S is the least active (2-20% of wild-type protease), mutants N88D, R8Q, and L90M exhibit activities ranging from 20 to 40% and G48V from 50 to 80% of the wild-type activity. In contrast, D30N is variable in its activity on different substrates (10-110% of wild-type), with the PR-RT site being the most affected. Mutants K45I and M46L, usually selected in combination with other mutations, showed activities that are similar to (60-110%) or greater than (110-530%) wild-type, respectively. No direct relationship was observed between catalytic activity, inhibition, and structural stability. The mutants D30N and V82S were similar to wild-type protease in their stability toward urea denaturation, while R8Q, G48V, and L90M showed 1.5 to 2.7-fold decreased stability, and N88D and K45I showed 1.6 to 1.7-fold increased stability. The crystal structures of R8Q, K45I and L90M mutants complexed with a CA-p2 analog inhibitor were determined at 2.0, 1.55 and 1.88 A resolution, respectively, and compared to the wild-type structure. The intersubunit hydrophobic contacts observed in the crystal structures are in good agreement with the relative structural stability of the mutant proteases. All these results suggest that viral resistance does not arise by a single mechanism.
9041631	The NMR side-chain assignments and solution structure of enzyme IIBcellobiose of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system of Escherichia coli.	The assignment of the side-chain NMR resonances and the determination of the three-dimensional solution structure of the C10S mutant of enzyme IIBcellobiose (IIBcel) of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system of Escherichia coli are presented. The side-chain resonances were assigned nearly completely using a variety of mostly heteronuclear NMR experiments, including HCCH-TOCSY, HCCH-COSY, and COCCH-TOCSY experiments as well as CBCACOHA, CBCA(CO)NH, and HBHA(CBCA)(CO)NH experiments. In order to obtain the three-dimensional structure, NOE data were collected from 15N-NOESY-HSQC, 13C-HSQC-NOESY, and 2D NOE experiments. The distance restraints derived from these NOE data were used in distance geometry calculations followed by molecular dynamics and simulated annealing protocols. In an iterative procedure, additional NOE assignments were derived from the calculated structures and new structures were calculated. The final set of structures, calculated with approximately 2000 unambiguous and ambiguous distance restraints, has an rms deviation of 1.1 A on C alpha atoms. IIBcel consists of a four stranded parallel beta-sheet, in the order 2134. The sheet is flanked with two and three alpha-helices on either side. Residue 10, a cysteine in the wild-type enzyme, which is phosphorylated during the catalytic cycle, is located at the end of the first beta-strand. A loop that is proposed to be involved in the binding of the phosphoryl-group follows the cysteine. The loop appears to be disordered in the unphosphorylated state.
8627629	H NMR study of the solution structure of Ac-AMP2, a sugar binding antimicrobial protein isolated from Amaranthus caudatus.	The conformation in water of antimicrobial protein 2 from Amaranthus caudatus (Ac-AMP2) was determined using 1H NMR, DIANA and restrained molecular modeling. Ac-AMP2 is a 30 amino acid residue, lectin-like protein that specifically binds to chitin, a polymer of beta-1,4-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. After sequence specific resonance assignments, a total of 198 distance restraints were collected from 2D NOESY buildup spectra at 500 MHz at pH 2, supplemented by a 2D NOESY spectrum at 600 MHz. The location of the three previously unassigned disulfide bridges was determined from preliminary DIANA structures, using a statistical analysis of intercystinyl distances. The solution structure of Ac-AMP2 is presented as a set of 26 DIANA structures, further refined by restrained molecular dynamics using a simulated annealing protocol in the AMBER force field, with a backbone r.m.s.d. for the well defined Glu3-Cys28 segment of 0.69(+/-0.12) angstroms. The main structural element is an antiparallel beta-sheet from Met13 to Lys23 including a betaI-turn over Gln17-Phel8 with a beta bulge at Gly19. In addition, a beta'I turn over Arg6-Gly7, a beta'III turn over Ser11-Gly12 and a helical turn from Gly24 to Cys28 are identified. This structure is very similar to the equivalent regions of the X-ray structure of wheat germ agglutinin and the NMR structure of hevein.
15629661	Crystal structures of the signal transducing protein GlnK from Thermus thermophilus HB8.	The Thermus thermophilus HB8 genome encodes a signal transducing PII protein, GlnK. The crystal structures of GlnK have been determined in two different space groups, P2(1)2(1)2(1) and P3(1)21. The PII protein has the T-loop, which is essential for interactions with receptor proteins. In both crystal forms, three GlnK molecules form a trimer in the asymmetric unit. In one P2(1)2(1)2(1) crystal form, the three T-loops in the trimer are disordered, while in another P2(1)2(1)2(1) crystal form, the T-loop from one molecule in the trimer is ordered. In the P3(1)21 crystal, one T-loop is ordered while the other two T-loops are disordered. The conformations of the ordered T-loops significantly differ between the two crystal forms; one makes the alpha-helix in the middle of the T-loop, while the other has an extension of the beta-hairpin. Two different conformations are captured by the crystal contacts. The observation of multiple T-loop conformations suggests that the T-loop could potentially exhibit "polysterism," which would be important for interactions with receptor proteins. The crystal structures of the nucleotide-bound forms, GlnK.ATP and GlnK.ADP, have also been determined. ATP/ADP binding within a cleft at the interface of two adjacent T. thermophilus GlnK monomers might affect the conformation of the T-loop.
7743135	Three-dimensional structure of the diphtheria toxin repressor in complex with divalent cation co-repressors.	BACKGROUND: When Corynebacterium diphtheriae encounters an environment with a low concentration of iron ions, it initiates the synthesis of several virulence factors, including diphtheria toxin. The diphtheria toxin repressor (DtxR) plays a key role in this iron-dependent, global regulatory system and is the prototype for a new family of iron-dependent repressor proteins in Gram-positive bacteria. This study aimed to increase understanding of the general regulatory principles of cation binding to DtxR. RESULTS: The crystal structure of dimeric DtxR holo-repressor in complex with different transition metals shows that each subunit comprises an amino-terminal DNA-binding domain, an interface domain (which contains two metal-binding sites) and a third, very flexible carboxy-terminal domain. Each DNA-binding domain contains a helix-turn-helix motif and has a topology which is very similar to catabolite gene activator protein (CAP). Molecular modeling suggests that bound DNA adopts a bent conformation with helices alpha 3 of DtxR interacting with the major grooves. The two metal-binding sites lie approximately 10 A apart. Binding site 2 is positioned at a potential hinge region between the DNA-binding and interface domains. Residues 98-108 appear to be crucial for the functioning of the repressor; these provide four of the ligands of the two metal-binding sites and three residues at the other side of the helix which are at the heart of the dimer interface. CONCLUSIONS: The crystal structure of the DtxR holorepressor suggests that the divalent cation co-repressor controls motions of the DNA-binding domain. In this way the metal co-repressor governs the distance between operator recognition elements in the two subunits and, consequently, DNA recognition.
1538395	Crystallization of beta-galactosidase from Escherichia coli.	Two crystal forms of beta-galactosidase have been obtained from Escherichia coli. One crystal form is hexagonal space group P6222 or enantiomorph, with cell dimensions a = b = 154 A, c = 750 A. The second form is monoclinic, space group P21, with cell dimensions a = 107.9 A, b = 207.5 A, c = 509.9 A, beta = 94.7 degrees. The monoclinic form seems better suited to detailed structural analysis. The crystals are radiation-sensitive, but by using synchrotron radiation in conjunction with a long (400 mm) crystal-to-film distance it was possible to resolve the individual reflections. On the basis of crystal density measurements, there are four tetramers each of molecular weight 465,000 per asymmetric unit. The Patterson function strongly suggests that two of the tetramers are related to the other two by translation. The data are consistent with the tetramers having 222 point symmetry, but this is not proven.
9878371	The R78K and D117E active-site variants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae soluble inorganic pyrophosphatase: structural studies and mechanistic implications.	We have solved the structure of two active-site variants of soluble inorganic pyrophosphatases (PPase), R78K and D117K, at resolutions of 1.85 and 2.15 A and R-factors of 19.5% and 18.3%, respectively.In the R78K variant structure, the high-affinity phosphate group (P1) is missing, consistent with the wild-type structure showing a bidentate interaction between P1 and Arg78, and solution data showing a decrease in P1 affinity in the variant. The structure explains why the mutation affects P1 and pyrophosphate binding much more than would be expected by the loss of one hydrogen bond: Lys78 forms an ion-pair with Asp71, precluding an interaction with P1. The R78K variant also provides the first direct evidence that the low-affinity phosphate group (P2) can adopt the structure that we believe is the immediate product of hydrolysis, with one of the P2 oxygen atoms co-ordinated to both activating metal ions (M1 and M2). If so, the water molecule (Wat1) between M1 and M2 in wild-type PPase is, indeed, the attacking nucleophile.The D117E variant structure likewise supports our model of catalysis, as the Glu117 variant carboxylate group is positioned where Wat1 is in the wild-type: the potent Wat1 nucleophile is replaced by a carboxylate co-ordinated to two metal ions. Alternative confirmations of Glu117 may allow Wat1 to be present but at much reduced occupancy, explaining why the pKa of the nucleophile increases by three pH units, even though there is relatively little distortion of the active site.These new structures, together with parallel functional studies measuring catalytic efficiency and ligand (metal ion, PPi and Pi) binding, provide strong evidence against a proposed mechanism in which Wat1 is considered unimportant for hydrolysis. They thus support the notion that PPase shares mechanistic similarity with the "two-metal ion" mechanism of polymerases.
16008357	Structure-based engineering of internal cavities in coiled-coil peptides.	Cavities and clefts are frequently important sites of interaction between natural enzymes or receptors and their corresponding substrate or ligand molecules and exemplify the types of molecular surfaces that would facilitate engineering of artificial catalysts and receptors. Even so, structural characterizations of designed cavities are rare. To address this issue, we performed a systematic study of the structural effects of single-amino acid substitutions within the hydrophobic cores of tetrameric coiled-coil peptides. Peptides containing single glycine, serine, alanine, or threonine amino acid substitutions at the buried L9, L16, L23, and I26 hydrophobic core positions of a GCN4-based sequence were synthesized and studied by solution-phase and crystallographic techniques. All peptides adopt the expected tetrameric state and contain tunnels or internal cavities ranging in size from 80 to 370 A(3). Two closely related sequences containing an L16G substitution, one of which adopts an antiparallel configuration and one of which adopts a parallel configuration, illustrate that cavities of different volumes and shapes can be engineered from identical core substitutions. Finally, we demonstrate that two of the peptides (L9G and L9A) bind the small molecule iodobenzene when present during crystallization, leaving the general peptide quaternary structure intact but altering the local peptide conformation and certain superhelical parameters. These high-resolution descriptions of varied molecular surfaces within solvent-occluded internal cavities illustrate the breadth of design space available in even closely related peptides and offer valuable models for the engineering of de novo helical proteins.
14636605	Stabilization of a tetrameric malate dehydrogenase by introduction of a disulfide bridge at the dimer-dimer interface.	Malate dehydrogenase (MDH) from the moderately thermophilic bacterium Chloroflexus aurantiacus (CaMDH) is a tetrameric enzyme, while MDHs from mesophilic organisms usually are dimers. To investigate the potential contribution of the extra dimer-dimer interface in CaMDH with respect to thermal stability, we have engineered an intersubunit disulfide bridge designed to strengthen dimer-dimer interactions. The resulting mutant (T187C, containing two 187-187 disulfide bridges in the tetramer) showed a 200-fold increase in half-life at 75 degrees C and an increase of 15 deg. C in apparent melting temperature compared to the wild-type. The crystal structure of the mutant (solved at 1.75 A resolution) was essentially identical with that of the wild-type, with the exception of the added inter-dimer disulfide bridge and the loss of an aromatic intra-dimer contact. Remarkably, the mutant and the wild-type had similar temperature optima and activities at their temperature optima, thus providing a clear case of uncoupling of thermal stability and thermoactivity. The results show that tetramerization may contribute to MDH stability to an extent that depends strongly on the number of stabilizing interactions in the dimer-dimer interface.
11420435	The energetic cost of induced fit catalysis: Crystal structures of trypsinogen mutants with enhanced activity and inhibitor affinity.	The contribution of induced fit to enzyme specificity has been much debated, although with little experimental data. Here we probe the effect of induced fit on enzyme specificity using the trypsin(ogen) system. BPTI is known to induce trypsinogen to assume a trypsinlike conformation. Correlations are observed between BPTI affinity and the values of k(cat)/K(m) for the hydrolysis of two substrates by eight trypsin(ogen) variants. The slope of both correlations is -1.8. The crystal structures of the BPTI complexes of four variant trypsinogens were also solved. Three of these enzymes, K15A, DeltaI16V17/D194N, and DeltaI16V17/Q156K trypsinogen, are 10- to 100-fold more active than trypsinogen. The fourth variant, DeltaI16V17 trypsinogen, is the lone outlier in the correlations; its activity is lower than expected based on its affinity for BPTI. The S1 site and oxyanion hole, formed by segments 184A-194 and 216-223, are trypsinlike in all of the enzymes. These structural and kinetic data confirm that BPTI induces an active conformation in the trypsin(ogen) variants. Thus, changes in BPTI affinity monitor changes in the energetic cost of inducing a trypsinlike conformation. Although the S1 site and oxyanion hole are similar in all four variants, the N-terminal and autolysis loop (residues 142-152) segments have different interactions for each variant. These results indicate that zymogen activity is controlled by a simple conformational equilibrium between active and inactive conformations, and that the autolysis loop and N-terminal segments control this equilibrium. Together, these data illustrate that induced fit does not generally contribute to enzyme specificity.
16245921	Solution NMR structures of IgG binding domains with artificially evolved high levels of sequence identity but different folds.	We describe here the solution NMR structures of two IgG binding domains with highly homologous sequences but different three-dimensional structures. The proteins, G311 and A219, are derived from the IgG binding domains of their wild-type counterparts, protein G and protein A, respectively. Through a series of site-directed mutations and phage display selections, the sequences of G311 and A219 were designed to converge to a point of high-level sequence identity while keeping their respective wild-type tertiary folds. Structures of both artificially evolved sequences were determined by NMR spectroscopy. The main chain fold of G311 can be superimposed on the wild-type alpha/beta protein G structure with a backbone rmsd of 1.4 A, and the A219 structure can be overlaid on the wild-type three-alpha-helix protein A fold also with a backbone rmsd of 1.4 A. The structure of G311, in particular, accommodates a large number of mutational changes without undergoing a change in the overall fold of the main chain. The structural differences are maintained despite a high level (59%) of sequence identity. These proteins serve as starting points for further experiments that will probe basic concepts of protein folding and conformational switching.
12731868	Crystal structures of the ribonuclease MC1 mutants N71T and N71S in complex with 5'-GMP: structural basis for alterations in substrate specificity.	Ribonuclease MC1 (RNase MC1), isolated from bitter gourd seeds, is a uridine specific RNase belonging to the RNase T2 family. Mutations of Asn71 in RNase MC1 to the amino acids Thr (N71T) and Ser (N71S) in guanosine preferential RNases altered the substrate specificity from uridine specific to guanosine specific, as shown by the transphosphorylation of diribonucleoside monophosphates [Numata, T., et al. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 524-530]. To elucidate the structural basis for the alteration of substrate specificity, crystal structures of the RNase MC1 mutants N71T and N71S, free or complexed with 5'-GMP, were determined at resolutions higher than 2 A. In the N71T-5'-GMP and N71S-5'-GMP complexes, the guanine moiety was, as in the case of the uracil moiety bound to wild-type RNase MC1, firmly stabilized in the B2 site by an extensive network of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. Structure comparisons showed that mutations of Asn71 to Thr or Ser cause an enlargement of the B2 site, which then make it feasible to insert a guanine base into the B2 site of mutants N71T and N71S. This binding further allows for hydrogen bonding interaction of the side chain hydroxyl groups of Thr71 or Ser71 with the N7 atom of the guanine base. The mode of guanine binding of mutants N71T and N71S was found to be essentially identical to that of a guanosine preferential RNase NW from Nicotiana glutinosa. In particular, hydrogen bonds between the N7 atom of the guanine base and the hydroxyl groups of the amino acids at position 71 (RNase MC1 numbering) were completely conserved in three guanosine preferential enzymes, thereby indicating that the hydrogen bond may play an essential role in guanine binding in guanosine preferential RNases in the RNase T2 family. Consequently, it can be concluded that amino acids at position 71 (RNase MC1 numbering) serve as one of the determinants for substrate specificity (or preference) in the RNase T2 fimily by changing the size and shape of the B2 site.
8157648	Identical mutations at corresponding positions in two homologous proteins with nonidentical effects.	The x-ray structure of a mutant (Gly72 to Asp) of the Escherichia coli ribose-binding protein with altered transport function has been solved and refined to 2.2-A resolution with a conventional R-factor (R-factor = [formula: see text]) of 16.0% and good stereochemistry. Comparison with the wild type ribose-binding protein shows that the structure is disturbed little at the actual mutation site, but quite appreciably in a neighboring loop. Changes in the surface of the protein at the site of mutation, however, seem to explain the functional effects. A corresponding mutation of the related glucose/galactose-binding protein has different structural and functional effects due to the different structural context of the mutation site in that protein. These results are consistent with the concept that these proteins have slightly different ways of interacting with the membrane components in transport and chemotaxis.
10618385	NMR solution structure of the human prion protein.	The NMR structures of the recombinant human prion protein, hPrP(23-230), and two C-terminal fragments, hPrP(90-230) and hPrP(121-230), include a globular domain extending from residues 125-228, for which a detailed structure was obtained, and an N-terminal flexibly disordered "tail." The globular domain contains three alpha-helices comprising the residues 144-154, 173-194, and 200-228 and a short anti-parallel beta-sheet comprising the residues 128-131 and 161-164. Within the globular domain, three polypeptide segments show increased structural disorder: i.e., a loop of residues 167-171, the residues 187-194 at the end of helix 2, and the residues 219-228 in the C-terminal part of helix 3. The local conformational state of the polypeptide segments 187-193 in helix 2 and 219-226 in helix 3 is measurably influenced by the length of the N-terminal tail, with the helical states being most highly populated in hPrP(23-230). When compared with the previously reported structures of the murine and Syrian hamster prion proteins, the length of helix 3 coincides more closely with that in the Syrian hamster protein whereas the disordered loop 167-171 is shared with murine PrP. These species variations of local structure are in a surface area of the cellular form of PrP that has previously been implicated in intermolecular interactions related both to the species barrier for infectious transmission of prion disease and to immune reactions.

9546398	Crystal structure of the thermosome, the archaeal chaperonin and homolog of CCT.	We have determined to 2.6 A resolution the crystal structure of the thermosome, the archaeal group II chaperonin from T. acidophilum. The hexadecameric homolog of the eukaryotic chaperonin CCT/TRiC shows an (alphabeta)4(alphabeta)4 subunit assembly. Domain folds are homologous to GroEL but form a novel type of inter-ring contact. The domain arrangement resembles the GroEL-GroES cis-ring. Parts of the apical domains form a lid creating a closed conformation. The lid substitutes for a GroES-like cochaperonin that is absent in the CCT/TRiC system. The central cavity has a polar surface implicated in protein folding. Binding of the transition state analog Mg-ADP-AIF3 suggests that the closed conformation corresponds to the ATP form.
7473720	Proteolytic and conformational control of virus capsid maturation: the bacteriophage HK97 system.	Bacteriophage capsid assembly pathways provide excellent model systems to study large-scale conformational changes and other mechanisms that regulate the formation of macromolecular complexes. These capsids are formed from proheads: relatively fragile precursor particles which mature by undergoing extensive remodeling. Phage HK97 employs novel features in its strategy for building capsids, including assembly without a scaffolding protein, and the formation of a network of covalent cross-links between neighboring subunits in the mature virion. In addition, proteolytic cleavage of the capsid protein from 42 kDa to 31 kDa is essential for maturation. To investigate the structural bases for proteolysis and cross-linking, we have used cryo-electron micrographs to reconstruct the three-dimensional structures of purified particles from four discrete stages in the assembly pathway: Prohead I, Prohead II, Head I and Head II. Prohead I has icosahedral T = 7 packing of blister-shaped pentamers and hexamers. The pentamers are 5-fold symmetric, but the hexamers exhibit an unusual departure from 6-fold symmetry, as if two trimers had undergone a shear dislocation of about 25 A. Proteolytic conversion to Prohead II leaves the outer surface largely unchanged, but a major loss of density from the inner surface is observed, which we infer to represent the excision of the amino-terminal domains of the capsid protein. Upon expansion to the Head I state, the capsid becomes markedly larger, thinner walled, and more polyhedral: moreover, the capsomer shapes change radically; especially notable is the disappearance of the large hexon dislocation. No differences between Head I and the covalently cross-linked Head II could be observed at the current resolution of about 25 A, from which we infer that it is the conformational rearrangements effected by expansion that create the micro-environments needed for the autocatalytic formation of the isodipeptide bonds found in the mature virions ("pseudo-active sites").
9876114	Structural and functional analyses of benzamidine-based inhibitors in complex with trypsin: implications for the inhibition of factor Xa, tPA, and urokinase.	The trypsin-like serine proteinase superfamily contains a number of potential therapeutic targets, many of which are unsuitable for routine X-ray crystallographic studies. We have cocrystallized a selection of benzamidine-based inhibitors with bovine trypsin and solved their structures to a resolution of up to 1.7 A. Despite similar chemical formulas, the inhibitors exhibit a range of diverse binding modes that reflect their inhibitory spectra against the serine proteinases trypsin, thrombin, factor Xa, tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase (uPA). In contrast to the compact folded conformations of thrombin inhibitors which allow optimal binding in the well-defined hydrophobic S2/S4 pocket of thrombin, those effective against factor Xa exhibit an extended conformation that allows occupation of the S3/S4 region, where hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions can stabilize the conformation. One group of inhibitors containing an N-terminal 2,4, 6-triisopropylphenylsulfonyl (TIPPS) moiety show little or no penetration into the S3/S4 subsites of trypsin. These latter sites are occluded in uPA, explaining why this class of compounds is effective against uPA. Despite presenting an extensive hydrophobic surface toward the solvent, the Ki values for TIPPS-containing compounds against trypsin is in the range 10(-7) to 10(-8) M. Comparison of the binding of a bis-benzamidine inhibitor in trypsin and tPA indicate that a shift in potency can be induced by relatively minor changes in binding mode. Implications for the inhibition of these proteinases are discussed.
8535235	Water molecules participate in proteinase-inhibitor interactions: crystal structures of Leu18, Ala18, and Gly18 variants of turkey ovomucoid inhibitor third domain complexed with Streptomyces griseus proteinase B.	Crystal structures of the complexes of Streptomyces griseus proteinase B (SGPB) with three P1 variants of turkey ovomucoid inhibitor third domain (OMTKY3), Leu18, Ala18, and Gly18, have been determined and refined to high resolution. Comparisons among these structures and of each with native, uncomplexed SGPB reveal that each complex features a unique solvent structure in the S1 binding pocket. The number and relative positions of water molecules bound in the S1 binding pocket vary according to the size of the side chain of the P1 residue. Water molecules in the S1 binding pocket of SGPB are redistributed in response to the complex formation, probably to optimize hydrogen bonds between the enzyme and the inhibitor. There are extensive water-mediated hydrogen bonds in the interfaces of the complexes. In all complexes, Asn 36 of OMTKY3 participates in forming hydrogen bonds, via water molecules, with residues lining the S1 binding pocket of SGPB. For a homologous series of aliphatic straight side chains, Gly18, Ala18, Abu18, Ape18, and Ahp18 variants, the binding free energy is a linear function of the hydrophobic surface area buried in the interface of the corresponding complexes. The resulting constant of proportionality is 34.1 cal mol-1 A-2. These structures confirm that the binding of OMTKY3 to the preformed S1 pocket in SGPB involves no substantial structural disturbances that commonly occur in the site-directed mutagenesis studies of interior residues in other proteins, thus providing one of the most reliable assessments of the contribution of the hydrophobic effect to protein-complex stability.
40828	Regulation of fatty acid synthesis.	Acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthetase are the two major enzymes involved in the synthesis of fatty acids in animals. The activities of both enzymes are affected by nutritional manipulations. Although acetyl-CoA carboxylase is considered generally to be the rate-limiting step in lipogenesis, there is evidence that suggests that fatty acid synthetase may become rate limiting under certain conditions. The principal support for the view that acetyl-CoA carboxylase is the rate-limiting enzyme for lipogenesis is that the activity of the enzyme is controlled by allosteric effectors that change the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. Until recently, the only known control of fatty acid synthetase was through changes in rate of enzyme synthesis. Data are reviewed that show that fatty acid synthetase can exist in forms possessing different catalytic activities. Thus fatty acid synthetase appears to be subject to the type of control necessary for an enzyme to serve as a regulator of the rate of a biological process over a short term.

12962504	Pronounced conversion of the metal-specific activity of superoxide dismutase from Porphyromonas gingivalis by the mutation of a single amino acid (Gly155Thr) located apart from the active site.	Glycine 155, which is located approximately 10 A from the active metal sites, is mostly conserved in aligned amino acid sequences of manganese-specific superoxide dismutases (Mn-SODs) and cambialistic SOD (showing the same activity with Fe and Mn) from Porphyromonas gingivalis, but is substituted for threonine in most Fe-SODs. Since Thr155 is located between Trp123 and Trp125, and Trp123 is one member of the metal-surrounding aromatic amino acids, there is a possibility that the conversion of this amino acid may cause a conversion of the metal-specific activity of cambialistic P. gingivalis SOD. To clarify this possibility, we have prepared a mutant of the P. gingivalis SOD with conversion of Gly155 to Thr. The ratios of the specific activities of Fe- to Mn-reconstituted enzyme, which are measured by the xanthine oxidase/cytochrome c method, increased from 0.6 in the wild-type to 11.2 in the mutant SODs, indicating the conversion of the metal-specific activity of the enzyme from a cambialistic type to an Fe-specific type. The visible absorption spectra of the Fe- and Mn-reconstituted mutant SODs closely resembled those of Fe-specific SOD. Furthermore, the EPR spectra of the Fe- and Mn-reconstituted mutant SODs also closely resembled those of Fe-specific SOD. Three-dimensional structures of the Fe-reconstituted wild-type SOD and Mn-reconstituted mutant SOD have been determined at 1.6 A resolution. Both structures have identical conformations, orientations of residues involved in metal binding, and hydrogen bond networks, while the side chain of Trp123 is moved further toward the metal-binding site than in wild-type SOD. A possible contribution of the structural differences to the conversion of the metal-specific activity through rearrangement of the hydrogen bond network among Trp123, Gln70, Tyr35, and the metal-coordinated solvent is discussed.
