1.1.1.1	N249Y	1816	2043	Kinetic thermal stability studies at pH 9.0 for mutant SsADH showed a marked increase in activation enthalpy compensated by an entropy gain, which resulted in a higher activation barrier against thermal unfolding of the enzyme.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357

1.1.1.1	N249Y	2044	2321	Ammonia analysis showed that the Asn249Tyr substitution produced the effect of markedly reducing the extent of deamidation during thermoinactivation, thus suggesting that Asn249 plays a significant role in the mechanism of irreversible thermal denaturation of the archaeal ADH.

1.1.1.1	N249Y	2322	2634	Furthermore, the decrease in the activating effect by moderate concentrations of denaturants and studies with proteases and chelating agents point to an increase in structural rigidity and a tightening of structural zinc as additional factors responsible for the improved thermal resistance of the mutant enzyme.

1.1.1.1	N249Y	6701	7022	Furthermore, both the decrease in the activating effect by moderate concentrations of denaturants and studies with chelating agents and proteases point to an increase in the structural rigidity and a tightening of structural zinc as additional factors responsible for the improved thermal resistance of the mutant enzyme.

Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	21311	21545	Analysis of the ADH gene sequence isolated from the E. coli clone, which expressed the highest thermophilic and thermoresistant enzyme, revealed only one point mutation (A f T) located at position 1089 of the nucleotide sequence (18).	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	21596	21829	Such a Giordano et al. change did not affect the level of gene expression, since optimal conditions for cell growth and induction time were found to be the same for both the recombinant wild type (SsADH) and mutant (mSsADH) enzymes.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	21830	22143	Alignment of mSsADH and HLADH sequences with the consensus derived from the alignment of 46 ADHs (33) revealed the overall conservation and allowed the localization of the Asn249Tyr position at the coenzyme binding domain on the turn connecting the βD-sheet with the RE-helix in the so-called Rossmann folds (34).

1.1.1.1	N249Y	23546	23697	The specific activity of mSsADH is 26.1 units/mg, whereas that of SsADH is 4.1 units/mg, as determined at 65 °C, using benzyl alcohol as the substrate.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	23698	23939	Like native SsADH activity (23), the wild type ADH activity on benzyl alcohol only showed a slight dependence on pH, with a maximum around 9.0, while the activity of the mutant enzyme depended more closely on pH, with a maximum at about 8.5.

1.1.1.1	N249Y	23940	24059	The apparent optimal pH for the benzaldehyde reduction ranged from 6.9 to 7.5 for both the enzymes (data not reported).	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	24148	24325	The rate of the direct and reverse reaction increases as far as an instrumental limit of 93 °C for both the enzymes, although there is a more marked increase for the mutant ADH.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	25948	26102	 The values of the activation energy are 46.7 and 99.1 (first slope) kJ/mol (plot A) and 43.8 and 90.0 kJ/mol (plot B) for SsADH and mSsADH, respectively.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	27383	27523	The Asn249Tyr replacement considerably changes the catalytic pattern of the wild type enzyme, affecting both its specificity and efficiency.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	27524	27712	The affinity of the mutant decreases for all the alcohols and aldehydes tested, as indicated by Km values, but to a greater extent for the coenzyme (25-fold for NAD+ and 16-fold for NADH).	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	27631	27710	but to a greater extent for the coenzyme (25-fold for NAD+ and 16-fold for NADH	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	27793	28009	The catalytic rate increased by about 7-fold for the alcohols tested, except for cyclohexanol which is more quickly oxidated by mSsADH than the other alcohols (13-fold), although it is poorly accepted as a substrate.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	28010	28073	For the reverse reaction, mSsADH also shows increased activity.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	28074	28208	In fact, 4-methoxybenzaldehyde is 6-fold more quickly reduced, although much less accepted compared to the unsubstituted benzaldehyde.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	28209	28308	However, the catalytic efficiency does not improve much, whereas the decrease in affinity is large.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	28309	28494	With deuterated benzyl alcohol and cyclohexanol as substrates, the VmaxH/VmaxD ratio proved to be 1.1 ( 0.1 and 1.2 ( 0.1 for SsADH and 1.5 ( 0.1 and 2.5 ( 0.2 for mSsADH, respectively.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	28696	28787	The shape of mSsADH spectra (Figure 2A) appears to be similar to that of SsADH (Figure 2B).	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	28788	28953	However, the emission maximum of the mutant enzyme appears 5 nm redder, and the fluorescence intensity is about 25% higher with respect to that of the wild type ADH.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	29436	29568	the fluorescence spectra of SsADH and its mutant were compared at various pHs to detect structural differences in tertiary structure	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	29619	29806	As expected, the emission intensity of the intrinsic fluorescence of both ADHs decreased as the pH increased, due to the lower degree of energy transfer from tyrosinate to Trp residue(s).	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	29926	30041	The emission dependence on pH at 303 nm yields similar pKa values (10.3 ( 0.1) for both the ADHs (Figure 2, inset).	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	30154	30324	 The titration data for mSsADH, after correction for the inner filter effect, yielded values for the apparent Kd of 141 ( 7 and 98 ( 5 µM for NAD+ and NADH, respectively.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	30527	30634	 SsADH and mSsADH showed a CD spectrum typical of R-helical proteins, with double minima at 208 and 220 nm.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	30818	31030	 CD analysis yielded the following apparent composition of the secondary structure: 23.8 and 26.5% R-helix, 44.9 and 42.6% β-sheet, 5.4 and 6.8% turn, and 25.8 and 24.0% random for SsADH and mSsADH, respectively.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	31031	31141	These data indicate that the Asn249Tyr substitution has slightly changed the helicity and the β-sheet content.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	31142	31237	However, the R-helix contents are similar to those anticipated by secondary structure analysis.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	31688	31945	When the protein (5 µM) was added to 18 µM ANS, which was excited at 370 nm, a large increase in emission intensity occurred for the mSsADH compared to that for SsADH, in addition to a similar blue shift (55 and 60 nm, respectively) of the emission maximum.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	32122	32286	Instead, the presence of a large excess of NAD+ slightly affected the ANS binding to the mSsADH molecule and did not induce a further shift of the emission maximum.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	32287	32521	Binding studies yielded Kd values of 51 ( 6 and 6 ( 1 µM for apo and holo SsADH and 11 ( 1 and 14 ( 3 µM for apo and holo mSsADH, respectively, which reflect the higher hydrophobicity of the ANS binding site(s) on the mSsADH molecule.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	32901	33032	Inhibition kinetic studies support this observation since ANS does not affect the Km and Vmax values of both ADHs (data not shown).	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	33073	33293	Thermal denaturation of the wild type and mutant ADH was monitored by activity and fluorescence emission at 480 nm after incubation for 30 min at different temperatures and a protein concentration of 10 µg/mL (Figure 3).	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	33294	33484	The mutant enzyme seems more thermoresistant than the wild type up to a temperature of 80 °C, after which its activity decreases abruptly, resulting in a transition temperature (3-4 °C) that	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	33294	33431	The mutant enzyme seems more thermoresistant than the wild type up to a temperature of 80 °C	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	34170	34268	These data suggest that no important change in charge on the SsADH surface occurred upon mutation.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	34557	34604	These effects were not observed for the mSsADH.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	34605	34825	However, the addition of a 100-fold molar excess of NADH to the apo mSsADH was needed to obtain a 10% quenching level and the appearance of a large band centered at 462 nm, which is due to free NADH emission (Figure 2D).	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	35288	35471	The corresponding Arrhenius plots (insets in panels A and B of Figure 4) yield activation energy values of 222 ( 32 and 470 ( 42 kJ/mol for the wild type and mutant ADH, respectively.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	35654	35789	∆∆Gq values between the wild type and mutant ADH are maximal at 80 °C, indicating a higher stability of the latter at this temperature.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	35790	36023	In addition, activation entropy is higher for the mutant than for the wild type ADH by about 700 J mol-1 K-1, thus reflecting some loosening of the activated complex or changes in polarity which decrease the level of solvent binding.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	36024	36195	The marked increase in Ea and, consequently, in activation enthalpy suggests that some intramolecular stabilizing forces could be introduced by the Asn249Tyr substitution.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	36069	36195	in activation enthalpy suggests that some intramolecular stabilizing forces could be introduced by the Asn249Tyr substitution.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	36106	36195	some intramolecular stabilizing forces could be introduced by the Asn249Tyr substitution.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	36661	36841	The replacement of the Asn249 by a Tyr residue leaves the Asn248 residue to precede the aromatic amino acid which is known to correlate with a relatively low deamidation rate (43).	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	36842	37104	Therefore, greater ammonia development should be expected to occur from the wild type SsADH, with respect to the mutant enzyme, provided that the thermoinactivation conditions adopted here and structural requirements are favorable to a deamidation reaction (43).	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	37335	37393	The mutant enzyme releases less ammonia than the wild type	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	37833	38012	Furthermore, the midpoint of the SsADH thermal deactivation and aggregation transition coincide, whereas the mSsADH aggregation transition precedes the deactivation by about 1 °C.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	38013	38324	The aggregation is very marked for the mutant ADH at higher protein concentrations, evidently as a consequence of the more extended hydrophobic surface; in fact, at 70 µg/ mL, the aggregation precedes the inactivation of the mutant ADH by about 14 °C, and by only 3 °C that of the wild type (data not reported).	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	40810	40898	enzyme upon exposure to high temperature as a consequence of the Asn249Tyr substitution.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	41925	42056	 Both the enzymes turned out to be quite stable at 70 °C and at a concentration of 35 µg/mL in the absence of the chelating agents.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	42057	42200	Their addition, at millimolar concentrations, to the incubation mixtures caused the 30% drop in SsADH activity and no effect on that of mSsADH.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	42382	42539	The c1/2 values, i.e., the denaturant concentration needed to cause 50% inactivation, are 1.7 and 2.2 M GdmCl for the wild type and mutant ADH, respectively.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	42540	42680	However, the denaturation profiles show that SsADH is slightly more resistant than its mutant up to a chaotropic agent concentration of 1 M.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	42681	42938	Interestingly, the emitting chromophores in the mSsADH molecule appear to regain some of their hydrophobic environment between 1 and 1.5 M denaturant, after which their solvent exposure parallels that of the wild type enzyme chromophores (Figure 6B, inset).	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	43280	43430	It is important to note that the wild type ADH activity increases at low denaturant concentrations whereas the mutant enzyme is activated very little.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	43649	43938	Random mutagenesis by error-prone PCR and a screening method based on heat resistance and thermophilicity tests proved to be a successful strategy for isolating a mutant of the archaeal ADH endowed with increased activity, and improved thermal resistance with respect to the native enzyme.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	43810	43937	a mutant of the archaeal ADH endowed with increased activity, and improved thermal resistance with respect to the native enzyme	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	43939	44038	The Asn249Tyr substitution alters the environment of both the coenzyme- and substrate-binding site.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	44039	44232	The Kd values for NAD+ and NADH increase by 3 orders of magnitude, and this change in coenzyme affinity is higher than that observed in the native SsADH following Cys38 carboxymethylation (23).	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	44440	44569	Presumably, the Tyr249 sterically and electrostatically contrasts the interaction of the coenzyme molecule with the binding site.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	44570	44652	However, the substrate binding is also substantially affected by the substitution.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	44653	44846	In fact, the large decreases in the cyclohexanol and 4-methoxybenzaldehyde affinities suggest that the bulky phenolic group sterically disturbs the interactions at the substrate binding pocket.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	44847	45015	The increased catalytic activity of the mutant enzyme is due to the faster release of the coenzyme as a direct consequence of the major weakening of the binary complex.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	45016	45280	Accordingly, the kinetic isotope effect studies show that the NADH release is rate-limiting for the recombinant SsADH as observed for the native enzyme (23), but that the hydride transfer step partially controls the overall reaction catalyzed by the mutant enzyme.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	45281	45721	The activation of mSsADH and Cys38-modified SsADH (23) as well as HLADH mutated at the adenosine moiety binding site (16) or modified at essential amino groups (46, 47) suggests a common criterion as a guide for enhancing the turnover of this class of enzymes, namely, to facilitate the coenzyme release by chemical modification or substitutions which are able to electrostatically and/or sterically disturb the coenzyme-enzyme interaction.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	45722	45846	The tertiary structure of the wild type ADH is not changed substantially upon the mutation as the fluorescence studies show.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	47219	47379	SDS-induced equilibrium transition curves for SsADH and mSsADH proved to be similar, with the c1/2 value around 0.13% SDS, after incubation for 60 min at 30 °C.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	47380	47516	Moderate surfactant concentrations (0.05% SDS) only activated the wild type enzyme (by 115%) but not the mutant enzyme (data not shown).	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	47637	47762	However, holo SsADH and holo and apo mutant ADH retained 100% of the initial activity under the same experimental conditions.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N248Y	47787	47907	The above results suggested that some tightening of the overall structure of SsADH occurred upon Asn248Tyr substitution.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N248Y	47908	48161	The alternative hypothesis was that the mutant molecule was not activated further as it was already endowed with intrinsic flexibility at the catalytic site, and this contrasts with the higher c1/2 value observed for the deactivation of mSsADH by GdmCl.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N248Y	48162	48438	The lack of proteolytic cleavage observed after the R-chymotrypsin step adds further evidence that the mutant protein apparently conserves the structural integrity of the wild type ADH, but this evidence is limited to the protease specificity and moderate conditions reaction.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N248Y	48808	48956	The first loses more than 30% of its activity after 3 h at 50 °C, whereas the mutant enzyme retains 100% of its activity even after longer exposure.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N248Y	49365	49540	NADH quench the fluorescence emission of the mutant SsADH without any shift and energy transfer, suggesting that only small conformational changes affect the protein emission.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N248Y	49541	49767	The absence of an energy transfer process in mSsADH, which is so large in the SsADH, can be due to an unfavorable orientation of the NADH molecule for energy transfer and/or to a slight increase of the donor-acceptor distance.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N248Y	49768	49919	Furthermore, NADH fluorescence is enhanced and its emission maximum blue shifted on binding to SsADH, but in the presence of mSsADH it does not change.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N248Y	49920	50264	This drastic decrease in the relative quantum yield of the flexible NADH molecule may be due to the increased number of deactivating collisions with solvent molecules as well as to limited possibilities for internal conversion as a consequence of a reduced number of points of attachment to some elements of the coenzyme binding structure (51).	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N248Y	50265	50411	On the other hand, the mutant enzyme binds the fluorescent probe, ANS, very strongly presumably at the same sites present on the wild type enzyme.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N248Y	50412	50660	A decrease in solvent polarity and, to some extent, an increase in rigidity of the local environment have been demonstrated to increase the quantum yield and decrease the wavelength of emission of amino-substituted naphthalene derivatives (41, 48).	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N248Y	50661	50798	However, there is indirect evidence that the region which accepts the ANS molecule on both the ADHs is prevalently hydrophobic in nature.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N248Y	50799	51015	SsADH at a relatively high concentration precipitates in the presence of coenzyme, at room temperature, and the apo form of mSsADH gives a faint precipitate at relatively low concentrations and elevated temperatures.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	51016	51315	The substitution at the coenzyme binding domain of the Asn249 with a tyrosine residue has affected not only the catalysis mechanism but also the structural stability of the archaeal ADH, improving its resistance to heat, denaturants, and proteases, without dramatic changes in the overall structure.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	51469	51811	However, it is evident that the Asn249 plays an important role in the mechanism of irreversible thermal denaturation of SsADH, and that its substitution with a non-heat degradation susceptible residue has produced not only the effect of reducing the deamidation process but also the effect of increasing the rigidity of the molecular edifice.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	51600	51737	that its substitution with a non-heat degradation susceptible residue has produced not only the effect of reducing the deamidation proces	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	51600	51810	that its substitution with a non-heat degradation susceptible residue has produced not only the effect of reducing the deamidation process but also the effect of increasing the rigidity of the molecular edifice	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	51812	52039	A plausible hypothesis concerning the latter point is that the Tyr residue, which is more bulky and less polar than the Asn residue, may have occupied the cavity left by the latter, fitting more tightly than the parent residue.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	52040	52123	The tightening of residues in cavities has been correlated with stabilization (52).	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	D80Y	52124	52319	For example, the role of Asp80Tyr substitution in stabilizing kanamicin nucleotidyltransferase has been found to be correlated with the hydrophobicity of the residue in the protein interior (53).	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	52887	53092	Although the increase in helicity for mSsADH is slight and depends on the limiting sensitivity of the CD measurement and evaluation errors (55), it could also be linked to the observed thermostabilization.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	53093	53196	Moreover, the possibility of interaction of charged Tyr249 with the RE-helix dipole cannot be excluded.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	53197	53493	The coincidence of the fluorescence transitions for both the ADHs and the shift of the guanidine-dependent deactivation for the mutant enzyme to higher denaturant concentrations (Figure 6) suggest some stabilization related to catalysis, and this most likely involves the coenzyme binding domain.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	53647	53976	Proteolysis experiments highlight two important features, namely, the highly limited susceptibility of SsADH to proteolysis, which reflects the considerable structural rigidity achieved by this archaeal protein for functioning at elevated temperatures, and the further tightening of the overall structure induced by the mutation.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	53977	54085	In addition, R-chymotrypsin, which is endowed with different substrate specificity, is not active on mSsADH.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	54085	54248	 Therefore, it is the decreased flexibility rather than the changes in loop exposure which determines the increased protease resistance shown by the mutant enzyme.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	54359	54595	Data from thermoinactivation performed in the absence and presence of chelating agents add further evidence that the structural tightening achieved by the mutant ADH extends to the whole molecule, and is not limited to specific regions.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	E97C	55388	55578	Interestingly, the latter was replaced by a cysteine residue (33) to restore the four canonical cysteines that contribute to the structural zinc-binding motif present in all other ADHs (59).	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	E97C	55579	55801	The Glu97Cys mutant proved to be equally active but less thermostable than native SsADH, showing that at least part of the SsADH thermostability is due to the presence of the glutamate in its structural metal binding site.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	E97C	55802	55957	It is evident that the replacement of Cys with Glu represents a significant achievement in the evolutionary adaptation of SsADH to thermophilic conditions.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	56340	56635	Activation and Stabilization in Asn249Tyr SsADH As far as the influence of Asn249Tyr substitution on the zinc tightening is concerned, we hypothesize that long-range effects are involved, presumably across hydrogen bond networks or electrostatically through space within the protein scaffolding.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	56636	56757	It has been suggested (60) that making a protein surface more negatively charged results in a stronger metalbinding site.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	56758	56897	Fluorescence and electrophoresis data indicate no apparent change in the charge on the mSsADH surface with respect to the wild type enzyme.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	56898	57218	Therefore, it is not unreasonable to assume that the strengthening of structural zinc binding in mSsADH is mainly related to hydrogen bond networks involving the metal ligands, and that such interactions contribute greatly to the increased activation enthalpy associated with the thermoinactivation of the mutant enzyme.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	57219	57414	This large increase in enthalpy is, however, compensated by an entropy gain, thus resulting in a free energy value which is somewhat higher in the mutant compared to that in the wild type enzyme.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	57415	57577	In this context, it is evident that the mutation has increased the kinetic thermal stability of SsADH by raising the activation barrier against thermal unfolding.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	57759	58116	The large enthalpy of mSsADH renders its turnover more temperature-dependent, as the thermophilicity curve shows, while the entropy gain indicates that either less solvation accompanies the activated complex formation or the enzyme molecule assumes a somewhat less tight conformation in forming the ternary complex with respect to the wild type enzyme (34).	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	58703	58825	A single semiconservative substitution at the coenzyme binding domain has shifted this balance slightly toward the former,	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357

1.1.1.1	N249Y	58703	58967	A single semiconservative substitution at the coenzyme binding domain has shifted this balance slightly toward the former, resulting in greater thermal resistance without any detriment to the specific activity of the enzyme, which in fact proves to be more active.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357
1.1.1.1	N249Y	58968	59115	This study serves as a good example of how it is possible to improve both the stability and activity of a protein, even with the same substitution.	Sulfolobus solfataricus	10074357

1.1.3.17	H99N	28689	29191	the reaction of hydride ion transfer in the H99N enzyme with the flavin non-covalently attached to the protein requires significant sampling of the reactive configuration that is conducive to the tunneling reaction, as shown by the AH′/AD′ ratio not being significantly different from unity, the large value for the ΔEa with protium and deuterium, the effect of temperature on the Dkred values with 1,2-[2H4]choline, and the different ΔH‡ values for the cleavage of the CH and CD bonds of the substrate	Arthrobacter globiformis	19398559

1.1.3.17	H99N	30779	31058	 Independent evidence supporting the lack of commitments to catalysis in the Asn-99 variant enzyme is the lack of perturbation in the kinetic pKa value of 8.4 ± 0.1 determined in the pH profile for the kcat/Km value when choline is substituted with 1,2-[2H4]choline as substrate.	Arthrobacter globiformis	19398559
1.1.3.17	H99N	31573	31809	Evidence for these conclusions comes from the pH profiles of the steady-state kinetic parameters kcat/Km and kcat showing that an unprotonated group with thermodynamic pKa value of 8.2 to 8.4 is required for catalysis in the H99N enzyme	Arthrobacter globiformis	19398559

1.1.1.103	C38E	39793	39896	stimulated its nearly nondetectable level of activity in a saturable manner (activation Kd ϳ 4 ␮M Cd2ϩ)	Escherichia coli K-12	9784233
1.1.1.103	C38S	40087	40156	the ﬁnding that mutant C38S was catalytically inactive was unexpected	Escherichia coli K-12	9784233
1.1.1.103	C38S	40184	40234	that mutant C38S catalyzes a low level of activity	Escherichia coli K-12	9784233
1.1.1.103	C38S	40868	41022	 seemed reasonable to change Cys-38 to the negatively charged residues of aspartate or glutamate since they could potentially ligate a catalytic metal ion	Escherichia coli K-12	9784233
1.1.1.103	C38D	40868	41022	 seemed reasonable to change Cys-38 to the negatively charged residues of aspartate or glutamate since they could potentially ligate a catalytic metal ion	Escherichia coli K-12	9784233
1.1.1.103	C38D	41103	41236	Mutant C38D, as puriﬁed to homogeneity and containing one Zn2ϩ atom per subunit, showed only ϳ1% of the speciﬁc activity of wild-type	Escherichia coli K-12	9784233
1.1.1.103	C38S	41242	41329	Unlike mutant C38S, however, mutant C38D was stimulated to the wild-type activity level	Escherichia coli K-12	9784233
1.1.1.103	C38D	41271	41329	mutant C38D was stimulated to the wild-type activity level	Escherichia coli K-12	9784233
1.1.1.103	C38D	41369	41476	The active-site structure of Zn2ϩ-stimulated mutant C38D, therefore, does not seem to be adversely affected	Escherichia coli K-12	9784233
1.1.1.103	C38D	41517	41627	mutant C38D, Zn2ϩ was the most stimulatory; Co2ϩ and Cd2ϩ increased catalytic activity to a much lesser extent	Escherichia coli K-12	9784233
1.1.1.103	C38D	41634	41695	this stimulation of mutant C38D activity by Zn2ϩ is saturable	Escherichia coli K-12	9784233
1.1.1.103	C38D	41819	41863	this metal ion decreased that of mutant C38D	Escherichia coli K-12	9784233
1.1.1.103	C38D	41865	41932	Mutant C38D can apparently bind Mn2ϩ at or near the activating Zn2ϩ	Escherichia coli K-12	9784233
1.1.1.103	C38D	41944	42002	its Zn2ϩ-stimulated activity is lessened 90% by added Mn2ϩ	Escherichia coli K-12	9784233
1.1.1.103	C38D	42196	42266	Zn2ϩ-stimulated mutant C38D are more active with the natural substrate	Escherichia coli K-12	9784233
