1.1.5.2	S415C	14331	14615	We therefore expected that replacement of Ser415 by Cys would result in the formation of a disulfide bond between each monomer, leading to stabilization of the quaternary structure of PQQGDH-B. The resulting mutant enzyme, Ser415Cys, is the most stable PQQGDH variant so far reported.	Escherichia coli	12746550
1.1.5.2	S415C	15582	15706	mutants generally have multivalent disulfide-bond formations resulting in decreased flexibility of the quaternary structure.	Escherichia coli	12746550
1.1.5.2	S415C	16168	16439	A drastic increase in thermal stability was achieved by substituting Ser415 with Cys, without decreasing the catalytic activity of PQQGDH-B. Such a high degree of thermal stability may facilitate the preparation of enzymes and sensors with little loss of enzyme activity.	Escherichia coli	12746550

1.1.1.10	D238E/L242W	17046	17263	Discussion The present results of the mutations revealed that the cause of cold inactivation of mouse XR is due to the presence of Asp238 and Leu242 instead of the corresponding residues, Glu and Trp, of the human XR.	Mus musculus	12890481
1.1.1.10	Q137M	17538	17900	The involvement of Gln137 and Phe241 in the R-axis related subunit interaction has been demonstrated by our previous mutagenesis studies, in which the replacement of Gln137 with Met attenuates cold inactivation of mouse and rat XRs, and the introduction of an additional mutation of F241L to this Q137M mutant again converts it into the cold-sensitive form [16].	Mus musculus	12890481
1.1.1.10	L242W	18275	18614	In rodent XRs, the small side chain of Asp238 probably interferes its hydrogen bonding network with the main-chain atoms of residues 239-242, and the nonbulky and small side-chain of Leu242 compared to that of Trp also affects the configuration of Gln137 because the mutation of L242W improved the stability of mouse XR at low temperature.

1.1.1.10	Q137M	19118	19334	The stability of MLCR at low temperature may result from the presence of Met at position 137 instead of Gln137 of XR,because of the abolishment of cold inactivation of mouse and rat XRs by the mutation of Q137M [16].	Mus musculus	12890481

1.1.1.1	G223D	1167	1341	To investigate the minimal structural determinants for coenzyme specificity, several ADH8 mutants involving residues 223 to 225 were engineered and kinetically characterized.	Rana perezi	12902331
1.1.1.1	G223D/T224I	1648	1906	Catalytic efficiency with NADP(H) dropped dramatically in the double mutants, G223D/T224I and T224I/H225N, and in the triple mutant, G223D/T224I/H225N (kcat/KmNADPH = 760 mm-1 min-1), as compared with the wild-type enzyme (kcat/KmNADPH = 133,330 mm-1 min-1).	Rana perezi	12902331
1.1.1.1	T224I/H225N	1648	1906	Catalytic efficiency with NADP(H) dropped dramatically in the double mutants, G223D/T224I and T224I/H225N, and in the triple mutant, G223D/T224I/H225N (kcat/KmNADPH = 760 mm-1 min-1), as compared with the wild-type enzyme (kcat/KmNADPH = 133,330 mm-1 min-1).	Rana perezi	12902331
1.1.1.1	G223D/T224I/H225N	2007	2190	Conversely, in the triple mutant, catalytic efficiency with NAD(H) increased, reaching values (kcat/KmNADH = 155,000 mm-1 min-1) similar to those of the wild-type enzyme with NADP(H).	Rana perezi	12902331
1.1.1.1	G223D/T224I/H225N	2007	2190	Conversely, in the triple mutant, catalytic efficiency with NAD(H) increased, reaching values (kcat/KmNADH = 155,000 mm-1 min-1) similar to those of the wild-type enzyme with NADP(H).	Rana perezi	12902331
1.1.1.1	G223D/T224I/H225N	2191	2402	The complete reversal of ADH8 coenzyme specificity was therefore attained by the substitution of only three consecutive residues in the phosphate-binding site, an unprecedented achievement within the ADH family.	Rana perezi	12902331
1.1.1.1	D223G	5177	5328	The substitution D223G, as found in ADH8, would avoid the possible steric and electrostatic hindrances because of the extra phosphate group of NADP(H).	Rana perezi	12902331
1.1.1.1	D223G	5329	5474	In fact, different attempts to switch the coenzyme specificity in medium chain ADHs have been focused on mutations involving residue 223 (9 -12).	Rana perezi	12902331
1.1.1.1	D223G	5475	5628	However, full reversal of coenzyme specificity, in terms of having a mutant enzyme as catalytically efficient as the wild type, has been rarely achieved.	Rana perezi	12902331
1.1.1.1	T224I	10281	10371	Batch-wise purification of wild-type and T224I enzymes followed identical procedures (14).	Rana perezi	12902331

1.1.1.1	G223D/T224I/H225N	13884	14115	Reversal of Coenzyme Specificity in Alcohol Dehydrogenase
TABLE II Kinetic constants of wild-type and mutant ADH8 with NADϩ and NADPϩ at pH 7.5 Activities were measured with 1.5 mM octanol and 0.1 M sodium phosphate/NaOH at pH 7.5.	Rana perezi	12902331
1.1.1.1	G223D	16100	16315	Regarding the effect of substitutions on coenzyme kinetics, most of the observations made at pH 10.0 (Table I) could be confirmed at pH 7.5, for both the oxidation (Table II) and the reduction (Table III) reactions.	Rana perezi	12902331
1.1.1.1	G223D	16316	16494	This suggests that the introduced mutations had a similar effect on each coenzyme kinetics, independently of pH and whether the cofactor used was in its oxidized or reduced form.	Rana perezi	12902331

1.1.1.1	G223D	16495	16601	However, the substitutions did have a different effect on whether the cofactor used was NADP(H) or NAD(H).	Rana perezi	12902331
1.1.1.1	G223D	16602	16713	Single mutations only produced a small decrease (2- 8-fold) in the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) with NADP(H).	Rana perezi	12902331
1.1.1.1	G223D	16714	16835	Generally, this was because of an increase in Km values, whereas kcat values did not significantly change in the mutants.	Rana perezi	12902331
1.1.1.1	G223D	16836	17043	The substitution G223D did not hamper NADPϩ binding (see below) or change the catalytic rate significantly, as would have been anticipated, but resulted in an enzyme that still preferred NADP(H) over NAD(H).	Rana perezi	12902331
1.1.1.1	T224I	17044	17095	Similar results were obtained for the T224I mutant.	Rana perezi	12902331
1.1.1.1	T224I	17341	17448	Single mutations provided a positive effect on NAD(H) kinetics, with a moderate increase in kcat/Km values.	Rana perezi	12902331
1.1.1.1	T224I	17449	17621	T224I showed the best catalytic efficiency for a single mutant, whereas H225N displayed the lowest catalytic efficiency, mostly due to its high Km values for this coenzyme.	Rana perezi	12902331
1.1.1.1	H225N	17449	17621	T224I showed the best catalytic efficiency for a single mutant, whereas H225N displayed the lowest catalytic efficiency, mostly due to its high Km values for this coenzyme.	Rana perezi	12902331
1.1.1.1	T224I	17751	17839	At any pH employed, none of the three mutants showed a reversal of coenzyme specificity.	Rana perezi	12902331
1.1.1.1	T224I	17840	17949	Only the mutant T224I showed a very similar catalytic efficiency with the two cofactors at pH 10.0 (Table I).	Rana perezi	12902331
1.1.1.1	G223D/T224I	17950	18095	A double mutation, G223D/T224I or T224I/H225N, was the minimal change to show a clearcut effect on coenzyme specificity, both at pH 7.5 and 10.0.	Rana perezi	12902331
1.1.1.1	T224I/H225N	17950	18095	A double mutation, G223D/T224I or T224I/H225N, was the minimal change to show a clearcut effect on coenzyme specificity, both at pH 7.5 and 10.0.	Rana perezi	12902331
1.1.1.1	T224I/H225N	18292	18498	Kinetic constants could only be accurately measured for the T224I/H225N mutant in the oxidative direction: Km values for NADP(H) increased dramatically (up to 200-fold) and kcat values dropped down 30-fold.	Rana perezi	12902331

1.1.1.1	G223D/T224I	18499	18992	Catalytic efficiency with NADP(H) decreased from 1,500 to 10,000-fold for G223D/T224I and from 100 to 1,400-fold for T224I/H225N. Both mutants showed a moderate increase in kcat/Km values for NAD(H), mostly because of a small decrease in Km values (more marked in G223D/T224I), with respect to the single mutant T224I. Overall, the double mutants showed a switch in coenzyme specificity, but without reaching full catalytic efficiency with NAD(H), which was only observed in the triple mutant.	Rana perezi	12902331

1.1.1.1	G223D/T224I/H225N	18993	19113	The G223D/T224I/H225N triple substitution produced a complete reversal of coenzyme specificity, both at pH 7.5 and 10.0.	Rana perezi	12902331
1.1.1.1	G223D/T224I/H225N	19204	19419	Thus, the catalytic efficiency of the triple mutant with NAD(H) increased 30 -50-fold with respect to that of the wild-type enzyme, and it was even higher than the kcat/Km value of the wild-type enzyme with NADP(H).	Rana perezi	12902331
1.1.1.1	G223D/T224I/H225N	19204	19419	Thus, the catalytic efficiency of the triple mutant with NAD(H) increased 30 -50-fold with respect to that of the wild-type enzyme, and it was even higher than the kcat/Km value of the wild-type enzyme with NADP(H).	Rana perezi	12902331
1.1.1.1	T224I/H225N	19559	19750	On the other hand, the triple mutant could not be saturated by NADP(H) and the catalytic efficiency with NADP(H) decreased to about the same order of magnitude as those of the double mutants.	Rana perezi	12902331
1.1.1.1	T224I/H225N	20254	20471	Single substitutions had modest effects on the kcat value with NADPϩ but this dropped ϳ20-fold in the T224I/H225N double mutant and could not be determined in the triple mutant because saturation could not be reached.	Rana perezi	12902331
1.1.1.1	T224I/H225N	20254	20471	Single substitutions had modest effects on the kcat value with NADPϩ but this dropped ϳ20-fold in the T224I/H225N double mutant and could not be determined in the triple mutant because saturation could not be reached.	Rana perezi	12902331
1.1.1.1	T224I/H225N	20472	20670	For the double mutant, this dramatic change in the kcat value with NADPϩ paralleled an increase in the dissociation (Kia) and Michaelis constant (Ka) values for NADPϩ by 60and 30-fold, respectively.	Rana perezi	12902331
1.1.1.1	T224I/H225N	20671	20808	In contrast, the kcat value with NADϩ remained relatively unchanged in all the substituted forms, suggesting a common rate-limiting step.	Rana perezi	12902331
1.1.1.1	G223D/T224I/H225N	22167	22258	When using NADPϩ as a cofactor, the same increase was only seen in the single mutant forms.	Rana perezi	12902331
1.1.1.1	G223D/T224I/H225N	22259	22411	In contrast, the double and triple mutants did not display any significant isotope effect, indicating that hydride transfer was no longer rate-limiting.	Rana perezi	12902331

1.1.1.1	T224I/H225N	26534	26661	Therefore adjacent residues 223, 224, and 225 were systematically mutated and checked, separately or in different combinations.	Rana perezi	12902331

1.1.1.1	T224I/H225N	26925	27086	In contrast, in the T224I/ H225N mutant, kcat values for NADPϩ suffered a sharp decrease, which was associated with a marked increase in the Kia value for NADPϩ.	Rana perezi	12902331
1.1.1.1	T224I/H225N	26925	27086	In contrast, in the T224I/ H225N mutant, kcat values for NADPϩ suffered a sharp decrease, which was associated with a marked increase in the Kia value for NADPϩ.	Rana perezi	12902331
1.1.1.1	T224I/H225N	27087	27336	In this regard, in double and triple mutants, the catalytic efficiency dropped dramatically, reflecting the fact that Km values for NADP(H) increased, and even in most cases saturation could not be reached, and apparent kcat values likely decreased.

1.1.1.1	H225N	30237	30496	Similarly, the substitution of the corresponding Asp in other NAD-dependent dehydrogenases having the Rossmann fold did not generate NADP-dependent enzymes, although substitution improved the catalytic efficiency for NADPϩ and made it worse for NADϩ (35, 36).

2.2.1.1	H103A	945	1263	It was found that mutation does not affect the affinity of the coenzyme to apotransketolase (apoTK) in the presence of Ca2þ (a cation found in the native holoenzyme) but changes all the kinetic parameters of the ThDP-apoTK interaction in the presence of Mg2þ (a cation commonly used in ThDP-dependent enzymes studies).

2.2.1.1	H103A	10708	11028	To characterise the kinetic parameters of the individual steps of the holoTK reconstitution from the apoenzyme and coenzyme, the reconstitution kinetics of both WT and H103A TK species were investigated in the presence of Mg2þ at different ThDP concentrations and analysed using the set of equations describing Scheme 2.	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	15178335
2.2.1.1	H103A	11429	11626	Com1 2 3 parison of the primary dissociation constants (Kd ¼ Kd ¼ Kd , Scheme 2) for the WT and H103A TK species in the presence of Mg2þ shows that in the case of mutant TK they are somewhat lower.	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	15178335
2.2.1.1	H103A	11736	11825	The directionality of these changes suggests the lowering of ThDPs affinity to mutant TK.	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	15178335

2.2.1.1	H103A	13070	13256	In the presence of Ca2þ , the apparent Kd value for the second active center of TK was estimated as 0.33 lM for both WT and H103A TK (based on the Scheme 1 and data presented in Fig. 4).	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	15178335
2.2.1.1	H103A	14337	14540	Comparison of the data on WT TK and H103A TK shows that the values of all kinetic parameters characterizing the reconstitution of the holoenzyme in the presence of Ca2þ are identical for both TK species.	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	15178335
2.2.1.1	H103A	14654	14850	This result is in agreement with the X-ray crystallography data and indicates the lack of difference in the structures of WT and H103A holoTK upon their reconstitution in the presence of Ca2þ [1].	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	15178335
2.2.1.1	H103A	17697	17964	Replacement of His103 with alanine breaks the network of hydrogen bonds in the 40 -NH2 -area thereby causing the local changes in the protein’s conformation and decreasing in this way the affinity of the H103A TK (compared to WT TK) for ThDP in the presence of Mg2þ .

2.1.1.63	C145S	15419	15780	BrCH2OAc was used for comparison with CH2Br2 because S-(1-acetoxymethyl)GSH has been successfully applied as a model for studying the reaction of the short-lived S-(1-bromomethyl)GSH intermediate formed by the interaction of GSH and CH2Br2 with nucleosides and DNA (19), and it was expected that the AGT-Cys145S-CH2Br intermediate would also be highly unstable.	Homo sapiens	15206895
2.1.1.63	C145A	15781	15945	The presence of active hAGT increased both the toxicity and the mutagenicity of CH2Br2 in a dose-dependent manner, but the C145A mutant had no effect (Figure 1A,B).	Homo sapiens	15206895

2.1.1.63	C145S	24884	25027	BrCH2OAc, on the other hand, did not produce any detectable amounts of hAGT-DNA conjugates with either wild-type or Cys145Ser hAGT (Figure 5B).	Homo sapiens	15206895
2.1.1.63	C145A	27357	27570	As expected from the results in the histidine reversion assay of Figure 1, the frequency of rifampicin resistant (Rifr) mutants produced by CH2Br2 was increased about 100-fold by the expression of hAGT (Figure 7).	Homo sapiens	15206895
2.1.1.63	C145A	27571	27750	Sequence analysis of the mutants (Table 1) indicated that the spectrum of mutations induced by CH2Br2 in cells expressing hAGT was quite different from that in cells lacking hAGT.	Homo sapiens	15206895
2.1.1.63	C145A	28170	28317	The exposure of cells to the solvent DMSO did not result in any significant increase in mutations in the rpoB gene irrespective of the hAGT status.	Homo sapiens	15206895
2.1.1.63	C145A	28318	28527	The spectra of background mutants in TRG8 cells did not reveal any specific induction of G:C to A:T or G:C to T:A mutations (results not shown) and were similar to those reported for a recent large study (40).	Homo sapiens	15206895
2.1.1.63	C145S	31346	31444	The AGT-Cys145S-CH2Br formed in this reaction with CH2Br2 would be expected to be highly unstable.	Homo sapiens	15206895
2.1.1.63	C145S	32677	32860	This proposed stalling/idling at guanine residues would account for the very high percentage of mutations in the CH2Br2-treated AGT-expressing cells that occur at G:C pairs (Table 1).	Homo sapiens	15206895
2.1.1.63	C145S	33888	34291	BrCH2OAc is very active in reacting with Cys145 of the AGT; the combination of the high reactivity of this Cys residue and that of the BrCH2OAc causes the rapid loss of the ability of AGT to repair DNA, shown in Figure 2C,D. The resulting AGT-Cys145S-CH2OAC is unable to form a covalent DNA adduct after noncovalent binding to DNA (Figure 5B); therefore, no increase in mutagenicity or toxicity results.

2.1.1.63	C145A	35268	35443	The ability of the C145A hAGT mutant to increase the mutagenicity and toxicity of BrCH2OAc is quite similar to the ability of this mutant to enhance the response to MNNG (53).	Homo sapiens	15206895
2.1.1.63	C145A	35268	35443	The ability of the C145A hAGT mutant to increase the mutagenicity and toxicity of BrCH2OAc is quite similar to the ability of this mutant to enhance the response to MNNG (53).	Homo sapiens	15206895

2.1.1.63	C145A	35584	35733	We therefore suggest that BrCH2OAc forms O6-(CH2OAc)guanine adducts in DNA and that these are recognized by C145A AGT and protected in a similar way.	Homo sapiens	15206895
2.1.1.63	C145A	35734	35829	The magnitude of C145A enhancement on response to BrCH2OAc is greater than that seen with MNNG.	Homo sapiens	15206895

2.1.1.63	C145A	35830	35936	This could be due to a tighter binding of the C145A mutant to O6-(CH2OAc)guanine than to O6-methylguanine.	Homo sapiens	15206895
2.1.1.63	C145A	36153	36325	The modest effect of wildtype hAGT in reducing the mutations caused by BrCH2OAc may be due to the fact that BrCH2OAc is such a potent direct inactivator of hAGT (Figure 2).	Homo sapiens	15206895

2.1.1.63	C145A	36545	36745	The inactivated AGT-Cys145S-CH2COAc would not be able to protect the O6-(CH2OAc)guanine by NER in the same way as the C145A mutant because AGT alkylated at Cys145 is rapidly degraded in vivo (56, 57).	Homo sapiens	15206895
2.1.1.63	C145S	36545	36745	The inactivated AGT-Cys145S-CH2COAc would not be able to protect the O6-(CH2OAc)guanine by NER in the same way as the C145A mutant because AGT alkylated at Cys145 is rapidly degraded in vivo (56, 57).	Homo sapiens	15206895
2.1.1.63	C145S	37903	38074	However, the AGT-Cys145S-CH2Br conjugate, derived from CH2Br2, is more reactive than the episulfonium ion, AGT-Cys145S+(CH2CH2), derived from BrCH2CH2Br (Figures 5 and 6).	Homo sapiens	15206895
2.1.1.63	C145S	38075	38351	These two factors, lesser reactivity of CH2Br2 with AGT but greater reactivity of the resulting complex, may partially cancel out in the cell where much of the AGT is DNA-bound, but the instability of the AGT-Cys145S-CH2Br may cause decomposition before the reaction with DNA.	Homo sapiens	15206895
2.1.1.63	C145S	40121	40268	The relatively low stability of the AGT-Cys145S-CH2Br intermediate (Figure 6) may account for the lack of hAGT-CH2Br2 conjugates in MALDI analysis.	Homo sapiens	15206895
2.1.1.63	C145S	40269	40540	On the basis of the model of reaction of the hAGT intermediate with DNA and/or water, this instability would be expected for AGT-Cys145S-CH2Br since it cannot undergo cyclic transformation to an episulfonium ion in a way similar to the AGT-Cys145S-CH2CH2Br generated from	Homo sapiens	15206895
2.1.1.63	C145S	41565	41712	The AGTCys145S-CH2Br resulting from the reaction with CH2Br2 is able to react with guanine residues in DNA causing mutations and reducing survival.	Homo sapiens	15206895

2.1.1.72	D181A	17624	17831	Only a very small change of AP2 fluorescence was observed with the D181A variant in the presence of AdoMet and AdoHcy indicating that the amino acid exchange strongly reduced base flipping as well (Table 2).	Escherichia coli	15276835
2.1.1.72	Y184A	18161	18266	In contrast, exchange of the tyrosine residue (Y184A) led to an increase in the P fluorescence (Table 2).	Escherichia coli	15276835
2.1.1.72	Y184A	18427	18559	Different from wild-type Ecodam, addition of AdoMet to the binding buffer did not alleviate the fluorescence increase of the mutant.	Escherichia coli	15276835

2.1.1.72	Y184A	18660	18969	The increase in fluorescence of the Y184A variant can be interpreted in the light of the structure of the TaqI - DNA complex, where the aromatic residue corresponding to Tyr184 forms a stacking interaction with the flipped base after the insertion of the target base into the active site pocket of the enzyme.	Escherichia coli	15276835
2.1.1.72	Y184A	22155	22296	In contrast, a continuous increase in fluorescence that was much more prominent than that with wild-type was observed with the Y184A variant.	Escherichia coli	15276835
2.1.1.72	Y184A	23142	23429	In agreement with this expectation, the variant shows an enlarged equilibrium fluorescence effect in the steady-state experiments (Table 2) and a continuous increase in fluorescence in the stopped-flow experiments that is not followed by a decrease after the initial increase (Figure 4).

2.1.1.72	S188A	29792	30158	Whereas the time-courses of AP2 binding to the T190A variant were indistinguishable from wild-type, the fluorescence increase was delayed in the case of the S188A variant as illustrated by the observation that the wild-type enzyme and T190A show a maximum of the fluorescence well before one second (around 0.8 second) whereas the maximum of fluorescence is observed	Escherichia coli	15276835
2.1.1.72	T190A	31221	31375	The kinetics of base flipping by the T190A variant was fitted by very similar rate constants than obtained for the wildtype enzyme (Figure 4 and Table 3).	Escherichia coli	15276835
2.1.1.72	T190A	31376	31503	Similarly, the rates of target base binding (k3) were not affected significantly in any of the variants (Figure 4 and Table 3).	Escherichia coli	15276835
2.1.1.72	T190A	31711	31959	In contrast, in the case of the S188A variant the quantitative analysis revealed that the rate constant of base flipping is reduced at least seven- to eightfold in the mutant as compared to the lower limit of k2 of the wildtype and T190A (Table 3).	Escherichia coli	15276835
2.1.1.72	S188A	31711	31959	In contrast, in the case of the S188A variant the quantitative analysis revealed that the rate constant of base flipping is reduced at least seven- to eightfold in the mutant as compared to the lower limit of k2 of the wildtype and T190A (Table 3).

2.1.1.72	R124A	26569	26691	In agreement with the T4Dam structure, GATG and GATT sites were methyl-
ated by R124A faster than the canonical GATC site.	Escherichia coli	15882618
2.1.1.72	R124A	26829	27068	Thus, while R124A has a 100fold-reduced rate of DNA methylation at GATC sites relative to wild-type EcoDam, it methylated GATG and GATT sites 2- to 3-fold faster than GATC and 30- to 40-fold faster than the wt enzyme modified GATG or GATT.	Escherichia coli	15882618
2.1.1.72	R124A	26829	27068	Thus, while R124A has a 100fold-reduced rate of DNA methylation at GATC sites relative to wild-type EcoDam, it methylated GATG and GATT sites 2- to 3-fold faster than GATC and 30- to 40-fold faster than the wt enzyme modified GATG or GATT.	Escherichia coli	15882618

2.1.1.72	R124A	27069	27177	Therefore, R124A has lost the discriminatory requirement for a C:G base pair at the fourth position of GATC.	Escherichia coli	15882618
2.1.1.72	R124A	27377	27610	A comparison of specificity factors for the recognition of position 4 (S4) reveals that the R124A variant has an 8000-fold-changed relative preference for methylation of near-cognate sites modified at the fourth position (Figure 6F).	Escherichia coli	15882618
2.1.1.72	R124A	27663	27833	Furthermore, the R124A variant retained (or even increased) its specificity for the first and third positions in GATC, so this is a base pair-specific change (Figure 6B).	Escherichia coli	15882618

2.1.1.72	P126S	28019	28235	Naturally occurring variant phage enzymes (T2Damh and T4Damh), which efficiently modify GACC sites in addition to the canonical GATC site (Brooks and Hattman, 1978), contain a P126S substitution (Miner et al., 1989).	Escherichia coli	15882618
2.1.1.72	L122A	29162	29288	The specificity factor of wild-type EcoDam was 540; the value was increased at least 30-fold in the case of the L122A variant.	Escherichia coli	15882618
2.1.1.72	L122A	29289	29448	Because no activity at near-cognate sites could be detected with the L122A variant, the specificity factor given here is a lower limit, indicated by the arrow.	Escherichia coli	15882618
2.1.1.72	P134G	29449	29533	The specificities of the R124A, P134A, and P134G variants were dramatically reduced.	Escherichia coli	15882618

2.1.1.72	P134A	29875	30052	However, P134A exhibited a significant increase in methylation rates of GAAC and GACC substrates, with GACC being modified at almost the same rate as canonical GATC (Figure 6C).	Escherichia coli	15882618

2.1.1.72	L122A	30868	30986	The activity of the L122A variant of EcoDam (M114 in T4Dam; Figures 2B and 2C) is not appreciably reduced (Figure 5B).	Escherichia coli	15882618
2.1.1.72	L122A	31096	31187	This indicates that the L122A variant has a significantly improved specificity (Figure 6H).	Escherichia coli	15882618
2.1.1.72	L122A	31311	31612	Whereas the L122A change alone does not severely reduce catalytic activity on the normal GATC substrate, a combination of L122A with the change of any of the base pairs in the recognition site may disturb synergistically the protein-DNA interface, and this could explain the complete loss of activity.

Escherichia coli	15882618
2.1.1.72	Y119A	31944	32010	As shown in Figure 5B, Y119A was the second-most-affected variant.	Escherichia coli	15882618
2.1.1.72	N120A	32182	32403	In contrast, removal of the side chain of N120 (N120A) had only a minor effect on methylation rate, although the structure of the specific T4Dam-DNA complex suggests an important role for this amino acid in base flipping.	Escherichia coli	15882618
2.1.1.72	N136A	36741	36871	This result agrees with a similar conclusion drawn from rapid kinetics experiments with M.EcoRV variants (Beck and Jeltsch, 2002).	Escherichia coli	15882618
2.1.1.72	R124A	37837	37960	We analyzed the biochemical effects of altering the contacts described above in double-mutant cycles (Fersht et al., 1992).	Escherichia coli	15882618
2.1.1.72	R124A	38074	38219	We found that it was possible to predictably design MTase variants that no longer recognize one specific base pair within their recognition site.	Escherichia coli	15882618
2.1.1.72	R124A	38220	38363	The EcoDam R124A variant displayed a change in specificity because it had a significantly higher catalytic activity toward a near-cognate site.	Escherichia coli	15882618
2.1.1.72	P134A	38364	38585	In addition, the EcoDam P134A variant (the analog of the T4Damh MTase) methylated a near-cognate site at almost the same rate as wild-type EcoDam modified the canonical site, indicating a broadened specificity (Figure 6).	Escherichia coli	15882618

2.1.1.72	P134A	39570	39693	Disruption of the contact by removal of the amino acid side chain led to a strongly reduced activity of the enzyme variant.	Escherichia coli	15882618
2.1.1.72	P134G	39570	39693	Disruption of the contact by removal of the amino acid side chain led to a strongly reduced activity of the enzyme variant.	Escherichia coli	15882618

2.1.1.63	C145S	1736	1932	A rapid increase of fluorescence (k ϳ200 s؊1) was observed with O6-MeG and O6-BzG and AGT but not with a Gly mutation at Arg128, which has been implicated in base flipping with crystal structures.	Homo sapiens	16000301
2.1.1.63	C145S	2290	2492	The results explain the overall patterns of rates of alkyl group removal versus AGT concentration and the effects of the mutations, as well as the greater affinity of AGT for DNA with O6-alkylG lesions.	Homo sapiens	16000301
2.1.1.63	R128G	17593	17766	Mutations at Arg128 and Tyr114, two residues implicated from site-directed mutagenesis and crystallography work (5, 22, 23), significantly reduced the AGT repair efficiency.	Homo sapiens	16000301

2.1.1.63	C145S	19244	19455	The rates of dissociation with the O6-alkylmodified DNA could not be measured with catalytically active AGT, and therefore either the C145A and C145S mutants (Table III) or the alkylated AGT (Table IV) was used.	Homo sapiens	16000301

2.1.1.63	R128L	20856	21033	AGTC145A, mutant totally devoid of activity, was added to a pyrrolo dC DNA duplex, and the fluorescence changes were recorded (using buffer for background subtraction) (Fig. 5).	Homo sapiens	16000301
2.1.1.63	C145S	21494	21608	These titration experiments were also done with the AGT-C145S mutant, which generated similar results (not shown).	Homo sapiens	16000301
2.1.1.63	R128G	22514	22650	Consistently, when Arg128 was replaced by Gly to abolish the base flipping “arm” (5), there was only a very limited fluorescence change.	Homo sapiens	16000301
2.1.1.63	C145S	30154	30308	Terashima et al. (34) considered the removal of several substituted benzyl derivatives and reported no differences among the substituted benzyl compounds.	Homo sapiens	16000301
2.1.1.63	C145S	30613	30848	AGT (C145S) was mixed with the oligonucleotide duplex with G or modified G opposite pyrrolo dC, and changes in fluorescence were monitored, using an excitation wavelength of 370 nm and collecting emission Ͼ400 nm with an end-on filter.	Homo sapiens	16000301

In contrast to the recently reported result for human Prx I (40), our crystal structure of the decameric rat C52S mutant (Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 2Z9S) showed that only one out of the five dimer-dimer interfaces involved a disulfide bridge from Cys83 to Cys83 of the adjacent dimer, indicating that stabilization of the decamer structure is not due to Cys83-Cys83 disulfide bridges at the dimer-dimer interfaces, but rather, is predominantly due to hydrophobic interaction and structural fitting, as is seen in the decameric structures of bacterial (26-28) and human (25) Prx II.

1.11.1.15	C83S	27465	27781	Influence of the Mutation on Peroxidase Activity—To clarify the role of amino acid residues in the active site of HBP23/Prx I, the activity of variants was examined in two ways, i.e. toward H2O2 in the presence of the Trx system, NADPH, Trx, and Trx reductase and toward t-butyl hydroperoxide in the presence of DTT.	Rattus norvegicus	17974571
1.11.1.15	C52S	28198	28372	The activity of all mutants determined in the Trx system was not significantly different from that in the DTT system except in the case of mutation at position 173 (Table 1).	Rattus norvegicus	17974571
1.11.1.15	C173S	28456	28576	The C173S mutant was fully active using DTT as an electron transfer partner, although it was inactive in the Trx system.	Rattus norvegicus	17974571
1.11.1.15	C83S	28719	28912	It should be noted that C83S exhibited activity similar to that of the wild type in the Trx system, and it is present exclusively as the dimer, as determined with size-exclusion chromatography.	Rattus norvegicus	17974571
1.11.1.15	C83S/C173S	28913	29177	In addition, the double mutant C83S/C173S exhibited the highest DTT-dependent activity among the variants studied, like the plant enzyme (39), in accordance with the idea that DTT can act in place of Cys173 and that Cys52 is involved in normal peroxidase activity.	Rattus norvegicus	17974571
1.11.1.15	C83S	29178	29280	The substitution of the arginine residues at positions 128 and 151 dramatically affected the activity.	Rattus norvegicus	17974571
1.11.1.15	C83S	29281	29452	When either of these was replaced with a lysine, alanine, or glutamate residue in the C83S mutant, the activity decreased to 2-7% of that of the wild type in both systems.	Rattus norvegicus	17974571
1.11.1.15	C83S	29568	29685	Substitution to lysine at these positions did not restore the activity, probably due to its lower strength as a base.	Rattus norvegicus	17974571

1.11.1.15	C83S	31752	32051	Although the fact that the mutant C83S cannot form the decamer might support the former possibility, it is more likely that replacement of the sulfur atom by the smaller oxygen atom favors dissociation to the dimer under circumstances where the dimer-dimer interfaces involve only weak interactions.

1.1.3.17	H99N	27706	28018	Evidence for this conclusion comes from the comparison of the effects of temperature on the rates of anaerobic flavin reduction (kred) and the related kinetic isotope effects (Dkred) determined with a stopped-flow spectrophotometer for the H99N enzyme (this study) and the wild-type form of choline oxidase (34).

Arthrobacter globiformis	19398559
1.1.3.17	H99N	30780	31058	Independent evidence supporting the lack of commitments to catalysis in the Asn-99 variant enzyme is the lack of perturbation in the kinetic pKa value of 8.4 ± 0.1 determined in the pH profile for the kcat/Km value when choline is substituted with 1,2-[2H4]choline as substrate.	Arthrobacter globiformis	19398559

1.1.3.17	E312Q	1840	2191	Thus, the conservative substitution of an active site residue that is involved in substrate binding, but not directly in catalysis, affects primarily the kred value that reports on catalysis and minimally the Kd value that reports on binding, thereby providing an example of the interplay that these kinetic parameters may have in enzymatic reactions.

Arthrobacter globiformis	19653994
1.1.3.17	E312D	22669	23053	Irrespective of whether the hydride ion in the reaction catalyzed by the Glu312Asp enzyme tunnels with assistance from the environment or is transferred over the energetic barrier that defines the transition state for the reaction, its transfer occurs at a rate that is $200-fold lower than the rate of the reaction in the wild-type enzyme (i.e., at 25 °C 0.4 sÀ1 versus 93 sÀ1) [10].
