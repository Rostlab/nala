Comparisons of clinical features between MSS and MSI group

*Statistical analysis was made between MSI and MSS group only

MSI state, germline mutations, and consequential changes in amino-acid sequence

The MSI state, mutation sites, and consequential changes in amino-acid sequences of MMR genes are summarized in Table 4. In 34 MSI CRCs and one MSS CRC with MLH1 negative staining, 8 had MMR gene germline mutations, accounting for 22.9% of MSI colorectal cancers and 5.5% of all colorectal cancers. Three patients had MSH6 germline mutations and 5 had MSH2 germline mutations; the clinical features of these patients are summarized in Table 5. None of the patients had MLH1 gene mutations. Seven patients in the MSI group had A/T heterozygosis in MSH6 codon 380 of exon 5, but it did not cause changes in the amino acid sequence. The germline mutations of the MSI-L and MSI-H CRCs are summarized in Table 6. Six CRCs with mutations were MSI-H and two patients with mutations were MSI-L.

Clinical features of patients in the MSI group with MMR gene mutations

The clinical features of MSI patients with MMR gene mutations are shown in Table 5. Mean age was 58.8 years (range: 34â€“78). Six were female and 2 were male. Only one patient had right side colonic lesion and 2 had mucinous carcinoma. There were no patients in Dukes' A or with synchronous/metachronous disease. Only one patient fulfilled the Amsterdam Criteria (II).
