Conclusion

In conclusion, this study shows that mutations in the CTNNB1 gene are presumably of minor importance in sporadic colorectal cancer. Although APC and K-ras mutations are often observed seperately in a tumour, these mutations seem to also occur in a co-dependent manner. Tumours that display mismatch repair deficiency, may form a distinct sub-group as they differ from tumours with APC and/or K-ras mutations with regard to age, sex, tumour sub-localisation and differentiation.
