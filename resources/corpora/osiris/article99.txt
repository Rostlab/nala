Association of tumor necrosis factor receptor type 2 +587 gene polymorphism with severe chronic periodontitis.

BACKGROUND: Genetic polymorphisms for cytokines and their receptors have been proposed as potential markers for periodontal disease. Tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) is one of the cell surface receptors for TNF-alpha. Recent studies have suggested that TNFR2 gene polymorphism is involved in autoimmune and other diseases. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study is to evaluate whether TNFR2(+587T/G) gene polymorphism is associated with chronic periodontitis (CP). METHODS: One hundred and ninety-six unrelated subjects (age 40-65 years) with different levels of CP were identified according to established criteria, including measurements of probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and alveolar bone loss (BL). All subjects were of Japanese descent and non-smokers. Single nucleotide polymorphism at position +587(T/G) in the TNFR2 gene was detected by a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP) method. RESULTS: The frequency and the positivity of the +587G allele were significantly higher in severe CP patients than in controls (p=0.0097; odds ratio=2.61, p=0.0075; odds ratio=3.06). In addition, mean values of PPD, CAL, and BL were significantly higher in the +587G allele positive than in the negative subjects (p=0.035, 0.022, and 0.018, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the TNFR2(+587G) polymorphic allele could be associated with severe CP in Japanese.
