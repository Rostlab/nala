The 894 G > T variant of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) increases the risk of recurrent venous thrombosis through interaction with elevated homocysteine levels.

BACKGROUND: Venous thrombosis is a multicausal disease involving both genetic as well as acquired risk factors. Hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with a 2-fold increased risk of recurrent venous thrombosis (RVT). Recently, the 894 G > T variant of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) was postulated to be associated with hyperhomocysteinemia. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized an interrelation of hyperhomocysteinemia, the eNOS 894 G > T variant and RVT risk. METHODS: The eNOS 894 G > T variant was studied in 170 cases with a history of RVT and 433 controls from the general population. RESULTS: The eNOS 894 TT genotype may increase RVT risk [odds ratio (OR) 1.3 (0.7-2.6)], but no association of the eNOS 894 G > T variant with elevated homocysteine was found in controls. Interestingly, in RVT cases the coexistence of both the 894 TT genotype and elevated tHcy levels (> 90th percentile) was more frequently present than in controls, which led to a substantially increased risk of recurrent venous thrombosis [fasting tHcy OR 5.3 (1.1-24.1), postload tHcy OR 6.5 (1.6-29.5)]. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study demonstrate that the eNOS 894 G > T variation interacts with elevated tHcy levels, leading to an increased risk of recurrent thrombotic events. This interaction points in the direction of S-nitrosation as a mechanism by which homocysteine exerts its detrimental effects on the hemostatic system.
