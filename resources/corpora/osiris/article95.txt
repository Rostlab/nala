Toll-like receptor 2 Arg677Trp polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis in Tunisian patients.

Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) is critical in the immune response to mycobacteria. Herein, we report that the frequency of a human TLR2 Arg677Trp polymorphism (C2029T nucleotide substitution) in tuberculosis patients in Tunisia is significantly higher than in healthy controls (P < 0.0001). This finding suggests that this polymorphism could be a risk factor for tuberculosis.
