A single nucleotide polymorphism in the MMP-1 promoter is correlated with histological differentiation of gastric cancer.

PURPOSE: Matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) plays a key role in cancer invasion and metastasis by degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) and basement membrane barriers. The 1G/2G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the MMP-1 promoter at position -1607 bp has been reported to affect the transcriptional activity. In the light of these findings, we investigated whether this SNP in the MMP-1 promoter is associated with the development, differentiation, and progression of gastric cancer. METHODS: The 215 gastric cancer patients and 166 controls were used in this study. The SNP of the MMP-1 promoter was analyzed by PCR-RFLP and sequencing. The genotype frequency was compared between cases and controls, and the association with clinicopathological parameters among cases was studied. RESULTS: The frequency of 1G/2G genotypes in gastric cancer patients was similar to those in controls (p=0.57). The degree of tumor invasion, the presence of lymph node metastasis, and clinical stage showed no significant association with the SNP. On the other hand, we found a significant association with histological differentiation and gender among gastric cancer patients (p<0.05, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of 2G allele in the MMP-1 promoter did not enhance the risk of gastric cancer; however, it may be involved in differentiation of gastric cancer.
