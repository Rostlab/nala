Modest implication of interleukin-6 promoter polymorphisms in longevity.

The multifunctional interleukin-6 has been suggested to contribute to a chronic low-grade inflammatory status, thereby conferring susceptibility to age-related pathological conditions as well as functional decline and increased mortality. Several polymorphisms have been identified in the interleukin-6 promoter, but investigation of the effect of these on interleukin-6 levels and disease susceptibility have led to contradictory results. This study investigates the significance of the three single-point polymorphisms (-597G/A, -572G/C and -174G/C) and the AT-stretch polymorphism (-373(A)n(T)m) in ageing, by comparison of the frequency of each single polymorphism separately as well as the entire promoter haplotype in a total of 1710 Danish subjects ranging in age from 47 to 100 years. We found a modest, but significant, increase in the frequency of interleukin-6 -174GG homozygotes with age suggesting that this genotype is advantageous for longevity.
