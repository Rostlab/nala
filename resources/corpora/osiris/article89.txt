Hypoadiponectinemia is an independent risk factor for hypertension.

Adiponectin is one of the key molecules in the metabolic syndrome, and its concentration is decreased in obesity, type-2 diabetes, and coronary artery disease. Genetic investigation has revealed that 2 polymorphisms (I164T and G276T) are related to adiponectin concentration and diabetes. To examine whether adiponectin affects hypertension genetically or biologically, we performed a case-control study. A total of 446 diagnosed cases of hypertension (HT) in men and 312 normotensive (NT) men were enrolled in this study. Plasma adiponectin concentration was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system. Single nucleotide polymorphisms were determined by TaqMan polymerase chain reaction method. After adjustment for confounding factors, adiponectin concentration was significantly lower in HT (HT: 5.2+/-0.2 microg/mL; NT: 6.1+/-0.2 microg/mL; P<0.001). Furthermore, multiple regression analysis indicated that hypoadiponectinemia was an independent risk factor for hypertension (P<0.001). Blood pressure was inversely associated with adiponectin concentration in normotensives regardless of insulin resistance. In subjects carrying the TC genotype of the I164T polymorphism, adiponectin concentration was significantly lower (TC: 2.6+/-0.9 microg/mL; TT: 5.5+/-0.1 microg/mL; P<0.01), and most of them had hypertension. In contrast, the G276T polymorphism was not associated with adiponectin concentration or hypertension. In conclusion, hypoadiponectinemia is a marker for predisposition to hypertension in men.
