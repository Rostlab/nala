Chemokine gene polymorphisms associate with gender in patients with uveitis.

Uveitis is an inflammatory condition of ocular tissue characterized by leukocyte infiltration, tissue damage, and decreased visual acuity. Chemokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of uveitis. Polymorphisms in the genes encoding chemokines have been described as affecting chemokine production or function. We analyzed the frequency of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding CCL2 (-2518 and -2076) and CCL5 (-403 and -28) in patients with Behcet's disease (BD), a systemic form of uveitis, and patients with retinal vasculitis (RV), an organ-specific form of disease. We report that there was no association between any SNP and disease. However, when segregated on the basis of gender the CCR5 -403 AA genotype was only found in male patients with BD. Similarly, CCL2 genotypes 1/2 were predominant in males, while genotype 4 was significantly associated with disease in female patients with BD. Differences in disease symptoms and severity between males and females have been described in BD and gender-specific genetic differences in chemokine gene function may be involved.
