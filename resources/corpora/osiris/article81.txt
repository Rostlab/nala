Association between the brain-derived neurotrophic factor 196G/A polymorphism and eating disorders.

Several lines of evidence suggest that genetic factors might contribute to the pathogenesis of eating disorders and that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a role in the pathophysiology of eating disorders. To investigate the role of the BDNF gene in the susceptibility to eating disorders, we analyzed the BDNF 196G/A gene polymorphism in female patients with eating disorders and female normal controls. The difference in the genotype frequency between patients (n = 198) and normal controls (n = 222) was statistically significant (P = 0.029). Interestingly, a significant (P = 0.015) difference in the genotype frequency between normal controls and bulimia nervosa patients (n = 101) with binge-purging type was detected. This study suggests that the BDNF 196G/A gene polymorphism might be associated with a susceptibility to eating disorders.Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
