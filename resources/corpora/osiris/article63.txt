Chromosome 11 monosomy in conjunction with a mutated SDHD initiation codon in nonfamilial paraganglioma cases.

Paragangliomas of the head and neck region are a group of rare, usually benign, slow-growing tumors developing from paraganglionic chemoreceptors in most patients. Mutations in a subunit of the mitochondrial enzyme II complex (succinate dehydrogenase [SDHD]) were shown to be responsible for the formation of paragangliomas. In addition, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 11, mainly in 11q23 (PGL1), was observed recently. We analyzed DNA derived from tumor sections of three unrelated paraganglioma patients (one case with multiple paragangliomas, two cases with single tumors; all of them sporadic cases) for mutations in the SDHD gene by direct sequencing. Microsatellite-based LOH was performed, and events of chromosomal loss were validated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on paraffin-embedded tumor and normal tissue by using centromeric satellite DNA. Sequence analysis revealed mutations in SDHD exon 1 in all patients, affecting the initiation codon (M1V). Another alteration was detected in exon 2 but was lacking in tumor DNA and therefore classified as polymorphism (H50R). LOH and FISH analyses demonstrated partial/total monosomy for chromosome 11 in the tumor samples tested. A common genetic mechanism appears to be the pathophysiologic basis for sporadic tumor development because the proposed two-hit model comprising both LOH and point mutation is manifest in our patients. Loss of chromosome 11 regions, including the deletion of PGL1 and PGL2 loci, may result in a more severe phenotype, as exemplified by the development of multiple tumors in one of the patients.
