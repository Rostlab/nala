In-depth haplotype analysis of ABCA1 gene polymorphisms in relation to plasma ApoA1 levels and myocardial infarction.

OBJECTIVE: By regulating the cellular cholesterol efflux from peripheral cells to high-density lipoprotein, the ABCA1 protein is suspected to play a key role in lipid homeostasis and atherosclerosis. Twenty-six polymorphisms of the ABCA1 gene were genotyped and tested for association with plasma levels of ApoA1 and myocardial infarction (MI) in the ECTIM study. METHODS AND RESULTS: In addition to single-locus analysis, a systematic exploration of all possible haplotype effects was performed, with this exploration being performed on a minimal set of "tag" polymorphisms that define the haplotype structure of the gene. Two polymorphisms were associated with plasma levels of ApoA1, 1 in the promoter (C-564T) and 1 in the coding (R1587K) regions, whereas only 1 polymorphism (R219K) was associated with the risk of MI. However, no haplotype effect was detected on ApoA1 variability or on the risk of MI. CONCLUSIONS: ABCA1 gene polymorphisms but not haplotypes are involved in the variability of plasma ApoA1 and the susceptibility to coronary artery disease.
