The folder contains the methods' predictions on the considered corpora.

The structure is as follows: `method_name/tested_corpus/`

The predictions are written in an arbitrary format, whatever it was easiest to get from the corresponding method.
Furthermore, each `tested_corpus` folder contains the file `results.tsv` that summarizes the performance results.
