Because oxidative stress may contribute to increased diabetes risk, the common variant of the MUTYH gene (AluYb8MUTYH) was investigated for its possible role in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A total of 565 T2DM patients and 565 healthy subjects from China were enrolled in a case-control study. The distribution of AluYb8MUTYH differed in diabetic patients from controls, with a moderately increased percentage of the mutant allele (P) (44.7% versus 40.3%, P = 0.033, OR = 1.199). However, this distribution was similar between the diabetic early-onset and late-onset subgroups. Another 66 T2DM patients were further evaluated for 8-hydroxy-2'deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels in leukocytic DNA. The average value of 8-OHdG/10(6) dG was 10.4 in patients with the wild-type genotype, 15.9 in heterozygotes, and 22.3 in homozygotes with the variation (P &lt; 0.001, compared with the wild-type). Therefore, the AluYb8MUTYH polymorphism could be a novel genetic risk factor for T2DM, and accumulated 8-OHdG could contribute to this disease.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
