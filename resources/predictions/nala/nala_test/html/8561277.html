To obtain additional information on gene geography of known ALDH2 alleles, and look for new variants, ALDH2 genes were evaluated in a Chinese population from Taiwan, a Yakut population of Siberia, and in five North American Indian populations. A novel approach based on a single-strand conformation polymorphism assay, and polymerase chain reaction-directed mutagenesis was developed for genotyping. In the Taiwan Chinese population, the ALDH2(2) allele frequency was 0.319 +/- 0.025, and this allele was not detected in the Yakut population nor in the five North American Indian populations. However, a new allele, ALDH2(3), was detected in Pima Indians at a frequency of 0.044 +/- 0.022, and this allele was also observed in 1 of 49 Pueblo samples. ALDH2(3) is a silent transition 1464 G--&gt;A, and it possibly has a wide distribution among North American Indians. A new subtype of the ALDH2(2) allele, designated as ALDH2(2Taiwan), was found in 1 of 174 Chinese from Taiwan. ALDH2(2Taiwan) is characterized by two G--&gt;A transitions at bases 1486 and 1510, resulting in Glu--&gt;Lys substitutions at both the 479 and 487 positions. Thus, this second nonconservative ALDH2 substitution occurs within the sequence of the already inactive ALDH2(2) allele.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
