Specifically, the KM value for NAD+ of beta 3 beta 3 is 70 times greater than that of beta 1 beta 1, and the Ki value for NADH is 35 times greater than that of beta 1 beta 1. To identify the structural basis of these catalytic differences, we sequenced regions of the beta 3 subunit and the beta 3 gene. beta 3 differs from beta 1 by the substitution of Cys for Arg-369. Based on x-ray crystallography of horse ADH, Arg-369 should interact with the nicotinamide phosphate moiety of NAD(H). The Cys for Arg-369 substitution would decrease the enzyme's affinity for coenzyme and, thus, account for the observed kinetic differences between beta 3 beta 3 and beta 1 beta 1.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
