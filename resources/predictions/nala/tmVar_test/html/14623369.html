The frequency of the C/T genotype and the T allele were significantly higher in the schizophrenia patients (25.7% and 13.9%, respectively) compared with the controls (5.9% and 2.9%). There were no significant differences in Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) items and Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scores between the patients with C/C and C/T genotypes. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the significance of this finding in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
