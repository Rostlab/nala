We investigated the frequency of ACE polymorphisms and their impact on the clinical course of INS in children in a Swiss hospital. METHODS: The ACE gene polymorphism (I, insertion; D, deletion) was assessed in 32 children - 22 with steroid-sensitive INS and 10 with steroid-resistant INS - with a median age at onset of INS of 2.9 years (range 1.1-15.0). Polymerase chain reaction amplification was performed on genomic DNA isolated from blood leucocytes. Results were correlated to clinical course and renal morphology. RESULTS: The ACE genotype was I/I, I/D and D/D in two, 12 and eight patients, respectively, with steroid-sensitive INS, and in one, eight and one patient, respectively, with steroid resistance. Renal morphology, available in 25 patients showed minimal change glomerulopathy in 17 patients (14 steroid-sensitive; three steroid-resistant) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in eight (one steroid-sensitive; seven steroid-resistant). There was no significant correlation between ACE genotype and steroid responsiveness, histology or outcome. ACE genotype was I/I, I/D and D/D in none, 12 and five patients, respectively, with minimal change glomerulopathy, and in one, five and two patients, respectively, with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Six patients with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome went into end stage renal disease; ACE genotype was I/I in one and I/D in five, but none were D/D. CONCLUSION: In contrast to previous reports, ACE gene polymorphism is irrelevant for clinical outcome, steroid responsiveness or morphology in Swiss children with INS.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
