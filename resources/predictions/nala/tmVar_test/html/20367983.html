This study aimed to identify mutations in a Chinese pedigree with MEN1. METHODS: A large Chinese family with MEN1 was collected. All of the coded regions and their adjacent sequences of the MEN1 gene were amplified and sequenced. RESULTS: In this family, a heterozygous cytosine insertion in exon 10 (c.1546_1547insC) inducing a frame shift mutation of MEN1 was found in the proband and the other two suffering members of his family. This mutation was linked to a novel single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in intron 3 (IVS3 + 18C &gt; T). CONCLUSIONS: The mutation in exon 10 of MEN1 gene might induce development of parathyroid hyperplasia and pituitary adenoma and cosegregate with MEN1 syndrome. The significance of the new found IVS3 + 18C &gt; T of MEN1 needs a further investigation.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
