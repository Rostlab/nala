Affected patients are at an increased risk of developing gastrointestinal and other malignancies. Mutations in the STK11/LKB1 (LKB1) gene, which encodes for a serine-threonine kinase, have been identified as a genetic cause of PJS. Molecular analysis of the LKB1 gene in a simplex case of PJS revealed a substitution of cytosine (C) for guanine (G) at codon 246 in exon 6, resulting in the Tyr246X mutation. The nucleotide substitution leads to a premature stop codon at the 246 residue, predicting a truncated protein and presumed loss of kinase activity. Analysis of DNA from both parents of the PJS patient did not show this mutation, which is therefore a de novo mutation. We isolated DNA from microdissected gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyps in the PJS patient and investigated the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the LKB1 locus by real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction genotyping using a fluorescent resonance energy transfer technique. The results suggest a different mechanism from LOH in the formation of hamartomatous polyps.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
