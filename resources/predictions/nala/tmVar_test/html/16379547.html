The majority of affected individuals carry repeat expansions of a dodecamer in the promoter region of the cystatin B gene. The unusually high GC content of this tract is refractory to conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and, as a result, a circumventive procedure involving the deamination of DNA with sodium bisulfite has been proposed. This study evaluates the effectiveness of this deamination modification for the detection of dodecamer repeat variants. An analysis of 258 healthy Japanese individuals revealed an allele with four copies of the dodecamer repeat with a frequency of 0.01, in addition to the more commonly observed two and three copy repeat alleles. Homozygous repeat expansions 600 and 680 base pairs in length were detected in the analyses of two affected individuals. For these cases, sequencing, along with an alternative PCR-stutter formation, revealed 41 and 48 copies, respectively, of the dodecamer repeat. The complete conversion of C to T was observed in the expanded tracts, indicating that no methylation occurred at the CpG sites. Based on these results, it was concluded that the use of deaminated DNA allows for a precise analysis of consecutive GC tracts.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
