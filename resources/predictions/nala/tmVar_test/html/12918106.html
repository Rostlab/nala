METHODS: Sixteen polymorphic microsatellite markers were analyzed on chromosome 5 and another 6 markers were applied on chromosome 5p15 in 83 cases of colorectal and normal DNA by PCR. PCR products were electrophoresed on an ABI 377 DNA sequencer. Genescan 3.1 and Genotype 2.1 software were used for LOH scanning and analysis. RESULTS: We observed 2 distinct regions of frequent allelic deletions on Chromosome 5, at D5S416 on 5p15 and D5S428-D5S410 on 5q. Another 6 polymorphric microsatellite markers were applied to 5p15 and the minimal region of frequent loss of heterozygosity was established on 5p15 spanning the D5S416 locus. CONCLUSION: Through our detailed deletion mapping studies, we have found a critical and precise location of 5p deletions, 5p15.2-5p15.3, which must contain one or more unknown tumor suppressor gene (s) of colorectal cancer.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
