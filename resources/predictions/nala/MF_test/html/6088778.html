There are four particles per unit cell, each situated on a crystallographic 3-fold axis. The orientation of these particles has been determined with a rotation function and their approximate positions have been derived from a Patterson map. The crystals diffract to at least 2.8 A resolution. Limitations to the possible surface features of the virus are set by a comparison of the cubic and orthorhombic crystal forms.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
