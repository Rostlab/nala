N-terminal sequencing and molecular cloning of one of the purified polypeptides resulted in the identification of a novel adaptor protein that shares strong structural homology to the recently cloned Fyn-associated adaptor protein SKAP55. This protein was termed SKAP-HOM (SKAP55 homologue). Despite their striking homology, SKAP55 and SKAP-HOM have distinct characteristics. Thus, unlike SKAP55, which is exclusively expressed in T lymphocytes, SKAP-HOM expression is ubiquitous. Furthermore, while SKAP55 is constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated in resting human T cells, SKAP-HOM is expressed as a non-phosphorylated protein in the absence of external stimulus but becomes phosphorylated following T cell activation. In addition, SKAP-HOM does not associate with p59fyn in T cells although it represents a specific substrate for the kinase in COS cells. Finally, we demonstrate that, as previously shown for SKAP55, SKAP-HOM interacts with the recently identified polypeptide SLAP-130.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
