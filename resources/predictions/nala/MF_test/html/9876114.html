We have cocrystallized a selection of benzamidine-based inhibitors with bovine trypsin and solved their structures to a resolution of up to 1.7 A. Despite similar chemical formulas, the inhibitors exhibit a range of diverse binding modes that reflect their inhibitory spectra against the serine proteinases trypsin, thrombin, factor Xa, tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase (uPA). In contrast to the compact folded conformations of thrombin inhibitors which allow optimal binding in the well-defined hydrophobic S2/S4 pocket of thrombin, those effective against factor Xa exhibit an extended conformation that allows occupation of the S3/S4 region, where hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions can stabilize the conformation. One group of inhibitors containing an N-terminal 2,4, 6-triisopropylphenylsulfonyl (TIPPS) moiety show little or no penetration into the S3/S4 subsites of trypsin. These latter sites are occluded in uPA, explaining why this class of compounds is effective against uPA. Despite presenting an extensive hydrophobic surface toward the solvent, the Ki values for TIPPS-containing compounds against trypsin is in the range 10(-7) to 10(-8) M. Comparison of the binding of a bis-benzamidine inhibitor in trypsin and tPA indicate that a shift in potency can be induced by relatively minor changes in binding mode. Implications for the inhibition of these proteinases are discussed.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
