X-ray diffraction data have been collected and molecular replacement for solving the structure is in progress. The space group for the recombinant rat cathepsin B was determined to be P2(1) with unit cell dimensions alpha = 62.2 A, b = 90.19 A, c = 47.07 A, and beta = 97.43 degrees. A unit cell contains 4 molecules and 2 molecules per asymmetric unit.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
