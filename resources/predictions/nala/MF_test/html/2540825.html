Large amounts of protein fragments were accumulated in induced cells and were purified by carrying out all fractionation steps in the presence of 6 M urea. The far-ultraviolet circular dichroism spectra of all four fragments suggested the presence of small to moderate amounts of residual structure. When the CD spectra were monitored as a function of concentrations of the tight-binding ligands Ca2+ and thymidine 3',5'-bisphosphate and the known affinity constants for wild-type nuclease (1-149) were used, apparent equilibrium constants of 160 and 2000 for the reversible denaturation reaction for fragments 1-136 and 1-128, respectively, were estimated. Four single and two double mutations, all of which exhibit unusual behavior in the full-length protein on solvent denaturation [Shortle, D., &amp; Meeker, A. K. (1986) Proteins: Struct., Funct., Genet. 1, 81-89] and thermal denaturation [Shortle, D., Meeker, A. K., &amp; Freire, E. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 4761-4768], were recombined into the 1-136 and 1-128 fragment expression vectors, and purified mutant fragments were characterized.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</p></div></section></article></body></html>
