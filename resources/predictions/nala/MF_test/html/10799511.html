We have determined the crystal structure of S-1153 in a complex with HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. The complex possesses some novel features, including an extensive network of hydrogen bonds involving the main chain of residues 101, 103, and 236 of the p66 reverse transcriptase subunit. Such interactions are unlikely to be disrupted by side chain mutations. The reverse transcriptase/S-1153 complex suggests different ways in which resilience to mutations in the non-nucleoside inhibitors of reverse transcriptase binding site can be achieved.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
