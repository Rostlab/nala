The hexadecameric homolog of the eukaryotic chaperonin CCT/TRiC shows an (alphabeta)4(alphabeta)4 subunit assembly. Domain folds are homologous to GroEL but form a novel type of inter-ring contact. The domain arrangement resembles the GroEL-GroES cis-ring. Parts of the apical domains form a lid creating a closed conformation. The lid substitutes for a GroES-like cochaperonin that is absent in the CCT/TRiC system. The central cavity has a polar surface implicated in protein folding. Binding of the transition state analog Mg-ADP-AIF3 suggests that the closed conformation corresponds to the ATP form.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
