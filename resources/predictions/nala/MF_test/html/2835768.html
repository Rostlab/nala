All of these bind into the same hydrophobic pocket within the viral protein VP1 beta-barrel structure, although the orientation and position of each compound within the pocket was found to differ. The compounds cause the protein shell to be less flexible, thereby inhibiting disassembly. Although the antiviral potency of these compounds varies by 120-fold, they all induce the same conformational changes on the virion. The interactions of these compounds with the viral capsid are consistent with their observed antiviral activities against human rhinovirus 14 drug-resistant mutants and other rhinovirus serotypes. Crystallographic studies of one of these mutants confirm the partial sequencing data and support the finding that this is a single mutation that occurs within the binding pocket.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
