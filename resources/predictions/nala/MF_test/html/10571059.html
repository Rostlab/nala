The crystal contains two independent dimers in the asymmetric unit. KAS I assumes the thiolase alpha(beta)alpha(beta)alpha fold. Electrostatic potential distribution reveals an acyl carrier protein docking site and a presumed substrate binding pocket was detected extending the active site. Both subunits contribute to each substrate binding site in the dimer.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
