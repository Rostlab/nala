All mutants comprised changes in beta-sheet residues, with sidechains at positions 5 (Leu), 7 (Leu), 52 (Phe) and 54 (Val) forming the beta-sheet side of the sheet-helix core interface. A solvent exposed position Ile-6 was chosen as a control. Randomization of bases at codon positions 1 and 3 with thymine at position 2 introduces five possible hydrophobic amino acids, namely Leu, Val, Ile, Phe, and Met. The distribution of encoded amino acids at all five positions is approximately as expected theoretically and indicates that no major bias was introduced towards particular residues. The overall structural integrity of several mutants, as assessed by NMR, ranges from very close to wild type to fully unfolded. Interestingly, the stability of the mutants is not strictly correlated with the number of changes or residue volume.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
