Among the residues involved in such specificity could be those located in regions where interaction with the pyrophosphate group of the coenzyme takes place, namely loops 155-160 and 261-268 in Anabaena FNR. In order to learn more about the coenzyme specificity determinants, and to better define the structural basis of coenzyme binding, mutations in the pyrophosphate and 2'-P binding regions of FNR have been introduced. Modification of the pyrophosphate binding region, involving residues Thr-155, Ala-160, and Leu-263, indicates that this region is involved in determining coenzyme specificity and that selected alterations of these positions produce FNR enzymes that are able to bind NAD+. Thus, our results suggest that slightly different structural rearrangements of the backbone chain in the pyrophosphate binding region might determine FNR specificity for the coenzyme. Combined mutations at the 2'-P binding region, involving residues Ser-223, Arg-224, Arg-233, and Tyr-235, in combination with the residues mentioned above in the pyrophosphate binding region have also been carried out in an attempt to increase the FNR affinity for NAD+/H. However, in most cases the analyzed mutants lost the ability for NADP+/H binding and electron transfer, and no major improvements were observed with regard to the efficiency of the reactions with NAD+/H. Therefore, our results confirm that determinants for coenzyme specificity in FNR are also situated in the pyrophosphate binding region and not only in the 2'-P binding region. Such observations also suggest that other regions of the protein, yet to be identified, might also be involved in this process.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
