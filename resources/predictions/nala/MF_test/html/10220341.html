(1996) Biochemistry 35, 6107] showed that the K+ site found in the proximal pocket of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) could be engineered into cytochrome c peroxidase (CCP). Binding of K+ at the engineered site results in a loss in activity and destabilization of the CCP compound I Trp191 cationic radical owing to long-range electrostatic effects. The engineered CCP mutant crystal structure has been refined to 1.5 A using data obtained at cryogenic temperatures which provides a more detailed basis for comparison with the naturally occurring K+ site in APX. The characteristic EPR signal associated with the Trp191 radical becomes progressively weaker as K+ is added, which correlates well with the loss in enzyme activity as [K+] is increased. These results coupled with stopped-flow studies support our earlier conclusions that the loss in activity and EPR signal is due to destabilization of the Trp191 cationic radical.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
