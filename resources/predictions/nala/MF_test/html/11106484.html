To investigate the basis for dimerization of HNF-1 proteins, we determined the 1.2 A resolution X-ray crystal structure of the dimerization domain of HNF-1alpha (HNF-p1). Phasing was facilitated by devising a simple synthesis for Fmoc-selenomethionine and substituting leucine residues with selenomethionine. The HNF-1 dimerization domain forms a unique, four-helix bundle that is preserved with localized conformational shifts in the DCoH complex. In three different crystal forms, HNF-p1 displays subtle shifts in the conformation of the interhelix loop and the crossing angle between the amino- and carboxyl-terminal helices. In all three crystal forms, the HNF-p1 dimers pair through an exposed hydrophobic surface that also forms the binding site for DCoH. Conserved core residues in the dimerization domain of the homologous transcriptional regulator HNF-1beta rationalize the functional heterodimerization of the HNF-1alpha and HNF-1beta proteins. Mutations in HNF-1alpha are associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3), and the structure of HNF-p1 provides insights into the effects of three MODY3 mutations.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
