We have constructed a covalently linked dimeric Lac-headpiece that binds DNA with four orders of magnitude higher affinity as compared with the monomeric form. This enabled a detailed biochemical and structural study of Lac binding to its cognate wild-type and selected DNA operators. The results indicate a profound contribution of hinge helices to the stability of the protein-DNA complex and highlight their central role in operator recognition. Furthermore, protein-DNA interactions in the minor groove appear to modulate hinge helix stability, thus accounting for affinity differences and protein-induced DNA bending among the various operator sites. Interestingly, the in vitro DNA-binding affinity of the reported dimeric Lac construct can de readily modulated by simple adjustment of redox conditions, thus rendering it a potential artificial gene regulator.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
