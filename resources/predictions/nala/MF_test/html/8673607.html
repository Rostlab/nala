In this report, we describe an unusual example of a structural rearrangement near a buried artificial cavity in cytochrome c peroxidase that occurs on binding protonated benzimidazole. A hinged main-chain rotation at two residues (Pro 190 and Asn 195) results in a surface loop rearrangement that opens a large solvent-accessible channel for the entry of ligands to an otherwise inaccessible binding site. The trapping of this alternate conformational state provides a unique view of the extent to which protein dynamics can allow small molecule penetration into buried protein cavities.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
