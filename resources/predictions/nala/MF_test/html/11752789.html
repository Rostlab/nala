Crystals of all polymorphs suitable for X-ray diffraction experiments were obtained by the vapour-diffusion method. Crystals of form I belong to the monoclinic system (space group C2), have unit-cell parameters a = 73.1, b = 133.1, c = 62.6 A, beta = 108.8 degrees and diffract to 2.27 A resolution. Three of the crystal forms are orthorhombic, with unit-cell parameters a = 225.4, b = 128.0, c = 62.6 A (form II, P2(1)2(1)2), a = 59.9, b = 71.2, c = 130.6 A (form III, primitive cell) and a = 73.8, b = 122.1, c = 124.2 A (form IV, P2(1)2(1)2(1) or P2(1)2(1)2); the crystals diffract to 2.33, 3.5 and 1.7 A, respectively. Polymorph V is trigonal, space group P3(1)21, with unit-cell parameters a = 123.1, c = 83.8 A; the crystals diffract to 2.65 A resolution.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
