In addition, the package calculates the Ramachandran angles at the central residue in the stretch of three amino acids having specified the flanking residue types. The package displays the Ramachandran angles along with a detailed analysis output. This software is incorporated with all the protein structures available in the Protein Databank.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
