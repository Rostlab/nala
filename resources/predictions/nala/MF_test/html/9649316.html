Unfolding Delta G and unfolding Delta H values of the Tyr --&gt; Phe mutant proteins were changed by from +0.3 to -4.0 kJ/mol and from 0 to -16 kJ/mol, respectively, compared to those of the wild-type protein. The net contribution of a hydrogen bond at a specific site to stability (Delta Gwild/HB), considering factors affected by substitutions, was evaluated on the basis of X-ray structures of the mutant proteins. In the present study, one of six mutant proteins was suitable for evaluating the strength of the hydrogen bond. Delta Gwild/HB for the intramolecular hydrogen bond at Tyr124 was evaluated to be 7.5 kJ/mol. Results of the analysis of other mutants also suggest that hydrogen bonds of the hydroxyl group of Tyr, including the hydrogen bond with a water molecule, contribute to the stabilization of the human lysozyme.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
