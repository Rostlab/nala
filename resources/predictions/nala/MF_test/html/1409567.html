Crystals of the reduced form were prepared by soaking crystals of the oxidized enzyme-substrate complex in deaerated mother liquor containing 300-400 mM NADPH. A rapid bleaching of the crystals indicated the reduction of the enzyme-bound FAD by NADPH. This was confirmed by single crystal spectroscopy. X-ray data to 2.3 A were collected on oscillation films using a rotating anode generator as an X-ray source. After data processing and reduction, restrained least squares refinement using the 1.9 A structure of the oxidized enzyme-substrate complex as a starting model, yielded a crystallographic R-factor of 14.8% for 11,394 reflections. The final model of the reduced complex contains 3,098 protein atoms, the FAD molecule, the substrate p-hydroxybenzoate and 322 solvent molecules. The structures of the oxidized and reduced forms of the enzyme-substrate complex were found to be very similar. The root-mean-square discrepancy for all atoms between both structures was 0.38 A. The flavin ring is almost completely planar in the final model, although it was allowed to bend or twist during refinement. The observed angle between the benzene and the pyrimidine ring is 2 degrees. This value should be compared with observed values of 10 degrees for the oxidized enzyme-substrate complex and 19 degrees for the enzyme-product complex. The position of the substrate is virtually unaltered with respect to its position in the oxidized enzyme. No trace of a bound NADP+ or NADPH molecule was found.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
