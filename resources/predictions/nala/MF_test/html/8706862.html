A nearly inactive mutant in which one of the active site threonines, Thr-89, was replaced by valine was constructed, expressed, and crystallized. Its structure, solved at 2.2 A resolution, shows high overall similarity to the wild-type enzyme, but an aspartyl moiety is covalently bound to Thr-12, resembling a reaction intermediate. Kinetic analysis confirms the deacylation deficiency, which is also explained on a structural basis. The previously identified oxyanion hole is described in more detail.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
