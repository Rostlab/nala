Members of this family include parvalbumin and many prominent regulatory proteins such as calmodulin and troponin C. EF-hand proteins are involved in a variety of physiological processes including cell-cycle regulation, second messenger production, muscle contraction, microtubule organization and vision. RESULTS: We have determined the structures of parvalbumin mutants designed to explore the role of the last coordinating residue of the Ca(2+)-binding loop. An E101D substitution has been made in the parvalbumin EF site. The substitution decreases the Ca(2+)-binding affinity 100-fold and increases the Mg(2+)-binding affinity 10-fold. Both the Ca(2+)- and Mg(2+)-bound structures have been determined, and a structural basis has been proposed for the metal-ion-binding properties. CONCLUSIONS: The E101D mutation does not affect the Mg(2+) coordination geometry of the binding loop, but it does pull the F helix 1.1 A towards the loop. The E101D-Ca(2+) structure reveals that this mutant cannot obtain the sevenfold coordination preferred by Ca(2+), presumably because of strain limits imposed by tertiary structure. Analysis of these results relative to previously reported structural information supports a model wherein the characteristics of the last coordinating residue and the plasticity of the Ca(2+)-binding loop delimit the allowable geometries for the coordinating sphere.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
