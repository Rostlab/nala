Both peroxidases have a tryptophan residue, designated the proximal Trp, located directly adjacent to the proximal histidine heme ligand. During the catalytic cycle, the proximal Trp in cytochrome c peroxidase is oxidized to a cation radical. However, in ascorbate peroxidase, the porphyrin is oxidized, not the proximal Trp, despite the close similarity between the two peroxidase active site structures. A cation located approximately 8 A from the proximal Trp in ascorbate peroxidase but absent in cytochrome c peroxidase is thought to be one reason why ascorbate peroxidase does not form a Trp radical. Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to introduce the ascorbate peroxidase cation binding site into cytochrome c peroxidase. Crystal structures show that mutants now bind a cation. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy shows that the cation-containing mutants of cytochrome c peroxidase no longer form a stable Trp radical. The activity of the cation mutants using ferrocytochrome c as a substrate is &lt; 1% of wild type levels, while the activity toward a small molecule substrate, guaiacol, increases. These results demonstrate that long range electrostatic effects can control the reactivity of a redox active amino acid side chain and that oxidation/reduction of the proximal Trp is important in the oxidation of ferrocytochrome c.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
