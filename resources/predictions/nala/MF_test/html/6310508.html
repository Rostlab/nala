The genome comprises a 5' non-coding region of 742 nucleotides, a large open reading frame of 6618 nucleotides (89% of the sequence) and a 3' non-coding region of 72 nucleotides. There is 77.4% base-sequence homology and 89.6% predicted amino-acid homology between types 1 and 3. Conservation of all glutamine-glycine and tyrosine-glycine cleavage sites suggests a mechanism of polyprotein processing similar to that established for poliovirus type 1.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
