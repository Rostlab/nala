Three possible secondary structures for the highly conserved 5' half of U2 snRNA are consistent with U2 phylogenetic sequence variation. To distinguish among these models and to test the function of U2 structural elements, we made greater than 35 mutations in the yeast U2 snRNA gene. Some of the mutations were designed in pairs so that combinations could be made that would restore base-pairing to differentiate helix requirements from primary sequence requirements. The mutations identify an essential stem-and-loop structure adjacent to the branchpoint interaction region. A conserved complementarity to the loop just upstream of the Sm site and an additional conserved stem-loop are dispensable for U2 function, even in the background of a previously identified large internal deletion. Non-Watson-Crick base appositions at the 53-62 base pair in the essential stem lead to a variety of temperature and KCl-sensitive phenotypes, as well as an accumulation of unspliced precursors in vivo. Chemical structure probing of U2 RNA in vivo reveals that the bulk of U2 in a yeast cell adopts a structure in good agreement with that deduced from genetic results. We suggest that this stem-loop is not a binding site for an intrinsic U2 snRNP protein but may interact with other factors during spliceosome assembly or splicing.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
