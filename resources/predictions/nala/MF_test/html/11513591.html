Three valines that cluster together in the major hydrophobic core of T1 were each replaced with Ala, Ser, Thr, and Cys. Compared to the wild-type protein, all these mutants reduce the thermodynamic stability of the enzyme considerably. The relative order of stability at all three positions is as follows: Val &gt; Ala approximately equal to Thr &gt; Ser. The effect of introducing a sulfhydryl group is more variable. Surprisingly, a Val --&gt; Cys mutation in a hydrophobic environment can be as or even more destabilizing than a Val --&gt; Ser mutation. Furthermore, our results reveal that the penalty for introducing an OH group into a hydrophobic cavity is roughly the same as the gain obtained from filling the cavity with a CH(3) group. The inverse equivalence of the behavior of hydroxyl and methyl groups seems to be crucial for the unique three-dimensional structure of the proteins. The importance of negative design elements in this context is highlighted.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
