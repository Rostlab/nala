The structure of C. reinhardtii thioredoxin h was solved in its oxidised form, and the ensemble of 23 converged structures superpose to the geometric average structure with an atomic rmsd of 0.080 nm +/- 0.016 for the (N, C(alpha), C) backbone atoms of residues 4-110. Comparisons with other thioredoxins, such as thioredoxin from the bacterium Escherichia coli, thioredoxin 2 from a cyanobacterium of the Anabaena genus, and human thioredoxin, showed that thioredoxin h models share more structural features with human thioredoxin than with other bacterial thioredoxins. Examination of the accessible surface around the redoxactive peptide sequence indicates that a potent thioredoxin-h-substrate interaction could be similar to the vertebrate thioredoxin-substrate interactions.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
