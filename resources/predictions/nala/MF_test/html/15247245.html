To elucidate the sequence-specific recognition properties of TRAS1-EN, we determined the crystal structure at 2.4-A resolution. TRAS1-EN has a four-layered alpha/beta sandwich structure; its topology is similar to apurinic/apyrimidinic endonucleases, but the beta-hairpin (beta10-beta11) at the edge of the DNA-binding surface makes an extra loop that distinguishes TRAS1-EN from cellular apurinic/apyrimidinic endonucleases. A protein-DNA complex model suggests that the beta10-beta11 hairpin fits into the minor groove, enabling interaction with the telomeric repeats. Mutational studies of TRAS1-EN also indicated that the Asp-130 and beta10-beta11 hairpin structure are involved in specific recognition of telomeric repeats.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
