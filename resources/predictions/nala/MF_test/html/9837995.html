Interproton distance and deoxyribose ring torsion angle restraints were deduced from homonuclear NOESY and DQF-COSY data, respectively. For both the control and alphaT duplexes, excellent global convergence was observed from two different (A- and B-) starting models. The final average structures of the two duplexes are highly homologous, and overall possess the traits characteristic of right-handed B-DNA duplexes. However, localized differences between the two structures stem from the enhanced conformational exchange in the deoxyribose ring of the cytidine following the 5'-5' linkage, the C3'- exo pseudorotation phase angle of the alpha-nucleotide, and unusual backbone torsions in the 3'-3' and 5'-5' phosphodiester linkages. The structural data reported here are relevant to the design of antisense therapeutics comprised of these modifications.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
