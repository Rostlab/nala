The crystal structure of HutP complexed with an L-histidine analog showed a novel fold; there are four antiparallel beta strands in the central region of each monomer, with two alpha helices each on the front and back. Two HutP monomers form a dimer, and three dimers are arranged in crystallographic 3-fold symmetry to form a hexamer. A histidine analog was located in between the two monomers of HutP, with the imidazole group of L-histidine hydrogen bonded to Glu81. An activation mechanism is proposed based on the identification of key residues of HutP. The HutP binding region in hut mRNA was defined: it consists of three UAG trinucleotide motifs separated by four spacer nucleotides. Residues of HutP potentially important for RNA binding were identified.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
