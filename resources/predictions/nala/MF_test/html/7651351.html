This toxin has no effect on receptors composed of alpha 2 beta 2, alpha 3 beta 2, alpha 4 beta 2, alpha 2 beta 4, alpha 3 beta 4, or alpha 4 beta 4 subunit combinations. In contrast to alpha-bungarotoxin, which has high affinity for alpha 7, alpha 9, and alpha 1 beta 1 gamma delta receptors, alpha-conotoxin ImI has low affinity for the muscle nAChR. Related Conus peptides, alpha-conotoxins MI and GI, exhibit a distinct specificity, strictly targeting the muscle subtype receptor but not alpha 7 or alpha 9 receptors. alpha-Conotoxins thus represent selective tools for the study of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
