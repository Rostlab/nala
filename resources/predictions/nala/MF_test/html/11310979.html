The protein was crystallized in a new hexagonal form (P6(5)22). Single crystals of this polymorph, suitable for X-ray diffraction, were obtained by vapor diffusion using 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol as precipitant (pH 4.8). The crystals are characterized by a = 81.0, c = 341.1 A and diffract to 2.45 A resolution. The asymmetric unit contains two protein molecules arranged into an AB dimer. The physiologically relevant ABA'B' homotetramer is generated by the action of the crystallographic 2-fold axis along [1, -1, 0]. Kinetic studies show that the loss of the phenolic hydroxyl group at position 25 brought about by the replacement of Y with F strongly impairs kcat without significantly affecting Km.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
