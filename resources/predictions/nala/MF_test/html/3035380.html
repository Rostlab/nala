The electron density map of poliovirus confirms the position of the myristate molecule and defines its location in the virus particle. Analogies with other myristylated proteins suggest that the myristate moiety in picornaviruses may be involved in capsid assembly or in the entry of virus into cells.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
