Because pyrimidine biosynthesis is an essential step in the progression of TB, the gene product pyrR is an attractive antitubercular drug target. The 1.9 A native structure of Mtb pyrR determined by the TB Structural Genomics Consortium facilities in trigonal space group P3(1)21 is reported, with unit-cell parameters a = 66.64, c = 154.72 A at 120 K and two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The three-dimensional structure and residual uracil phosphoribosyltransferase activity point to a common PRTase ancestor for pyrR. However, while PRPP- and UMP-binding sites have been retained in Mtb pyrR, a distinct dimer interaction among subunits creates a deep positively charged cleft capable of binding pyr mRNA. In silico screening of pyrimidine-nucleoside analogs has revealed a number of potential lead compounds that, if bound to Mtb pyrR, could facilitate transcriptional attenuation, particularly cyclopentenyl nucleosides.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
