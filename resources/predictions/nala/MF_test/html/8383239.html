To study the basis of drug resistance, we isolated and characterized a family of human rhinovirus 14 mutants resistant to WIN 52035-2. Thermostabilization data and single-cycle growth curves provided evidence for two classes of resistant mutants. One class, here called exclusion mutants, showed a marked decrease in drug-binding affinity and was characterized by substitution to bulkier amino acid side chains at two sites lining the hydrophobic pocket. The other class, called compensation mutants, displayed single-amino-acid substitutions in the drug-deformable regions of the canyon; these mutants were able to attach to cells despite the presence of bound drug. A delay in the rise period of the growth curves of compensation mutants indicated a second locus of drug action. WIN 52035-2 was found to inhibit the first step of uncoating, release of VP4. Attempts to identify this site of drug action by using single-step growth curves were obscured by abortive elution of a major fraction of cell-attached virus. The drug had no effect on the rate of this process but did affect the spectrum of particles produced.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
