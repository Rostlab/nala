Implications for the GDP/GTP exchange mechanism.</p><p id="abstract">Mg(2+) ions are essential for guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity and play key roles in guanine nucleotide binding and preserving the structural integrity of GTP-binding proteins. We determined the crystal structure of a small GTPase RHOA complexed with GDP in the absence of Mg(2+) at 2.0-A resolution. Elimination of a Mg(2+) ion induces significant conformational changes in the switch I region that opens up the nucleotide-binding site. Similar structural changes have been observed in the switch regions of Ha-Ras bound to its guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Sos. This RHOA-GDP structure reveals an important regulatory role for Mg(2+) and suggests that guanine nucleotide exchange factor may utilize this feature of switch I to produce an open conformation in GDP/GTP exchange.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
