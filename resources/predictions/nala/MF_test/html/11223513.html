The structures of these highly homologous enzymes were solved by molecular replacement and were refined with data extending to 2.2-2.5 A. These structures were compared with each other, as well as with other L-asparaginase structures previously observed with different crystal packing. It is concluded that the observed phenomenon, which is rare, was most likely to have arisen by chance.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
