The fusion protein was purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography on immobilized glutathione, and then cleaved with thrombin. After separation by a cation-exchange chromatography step, the DNA-binding domain exhibited proper folding, as shown by proton NMR analysis. Furthermore, it showed specific interaction with the operator region of the ace operon, as checked by gel retardation and DNA methylation-protection experiments.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
