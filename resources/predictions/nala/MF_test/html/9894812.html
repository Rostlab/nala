BH4 is an essential cofactor of NO synthases and aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, the latter being responsible for hepatic phenylalanine degradation and monoamine neurotransmitter biosynthesis. BH4 deficiency due to autosomal recessive mutations in the human gene for PTPS leads to a broad range of phenotypes ranging from mild hyperphenylalaninemia to high phenylalanine levels concomitant with neurotransmitter depletion. An animal model to study PTPS deficiency is thus desired to investigate the molecular basis of the disease and its variability. Here, we report on the isolation and recombinant expression of the mouse PTPS gene, Pts. It is located on chromosome 9C-D and contains six exons with an open reading frame of 144 codons. The derived protein monomer has a molecular mass of 16187 Da and shows 82% and 93% identity to its human and rat counterparts, respectively. The mouse PTPS was expressed in bacterial cells and purified to homogeneity. The kinetic properties of the recombinant protein, apparent Km of approximately 10 microM and k(cat) of 0.27 s(-1), were similar to the native mouse enzyme in liver and brain extracts, and to the corresponding human and rat PTPS.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
