The crystal structure of the mutant protein was the same as the wild-type structure, except that the hydroxyl group of the introduced Thr56 formed a hydrogen bond with a water molecule in the interior of the protein. The other physicochemical properties of the mutant protein in the native state were not different from those of the wild-type protein. However, the equilibrium and kinetic stabilities of the mutant protein were remarkably decreased due to the introduction of a polar residue (Thr) in the interior of the molecule. It can be concluded that the amyloid formation of the mutant human lysozyme is due to a tendency to favor (partly or/and completely) denatured structures.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
