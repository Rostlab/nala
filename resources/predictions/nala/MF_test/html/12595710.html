The purified protein was solubilized in n-octyl tetraoxyethylene (C(8)E(4)) and was crystallized using sitting-drop vapor diffusion with PEG 3350 and magnesium acetate as precipitants (pH 6.5). Two crystal forms have been obtained. Crystal type I belongs to space group P3(1)21, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 81.6, c = 210.0 A, alpha = beta = 90, gamma = 120 degrees. Crystal type II belongs to space group P3(1)21, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 81.6, c = 226.0 A, alpha = beta = 90, gamma = 120 degrees. Each crystal form contains a monomer in the asymmetric unit. Diffraction for crystal type I extends to 2.0 A and diffraction for crystal type II extends to 2.7 A. Both crystal forms are suitable for structure determination.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
