The structure of the catalytic domain of Cel6A from T. fusca in complex with a nonhydrolysable substrate analogue that acts as an inhibitor, methylcellobiosyl-4-thio-beta-cellobioside (Glc(2)-S-Glc(2)), has been determined to 1.5 A resolution. The glycosyl unit in subsite -1 was sterically hindered by Tyr73 and forced into a distorted (2)S(o) conformation. In the enzyme where Tyr73 was mutated to a serine residue, the hindrance was removed and the glycosyl unit in subsite -1 had a relaxed (4)C(1) chair conformation. The relaxed conformation was seen in two complex structures of the mutated enzyme, with cellotetrose (Glc(4)) at 1.64 A and Glc(2)-S-Glc(2) at 1.04 A resolution.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
