The groove defines a flexible, hydrophobic environment that is likely to contribute to the structural plasticity necessary for SRP to bind signal sequences of different lengths and amino acid sequence. The structure also reveals a helix-turn-helix motif containing an arginine-rich alpha helix that is required for binding to SRP RNA and is implicated in forming the core of an extended RNA binding surface.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
