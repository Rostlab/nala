The affinities of HEV32 for small chitin fragments--in the forms of N,N',N"-triacetylchitotriose ((GlcNAc)3) (millimolar) and N,N',N",N"',N"",N""'-hexaacetylchitohexaose ((GlcNAc)6) (micromolar)--as measured by NMR and fluorescence methods, are comparable with those of native hevein. The HEV32 ligand-binding process is enthalpy driven, while entropy opposes binding. The NMR structure of ligand-bound HEV32 in aqueous solution was determined to be highly similar to the NMR structure of ligand-bound hevein. Solvated molecular-dynamics simulations were performed in order to monitor the changes in side-chain conformation of the binding site of HEV32 and hevein upon interaction with ligands. The calculations suggest that the Trp21 side-chain orientation of HEV32 in the free form differs from that in the bound state; this agrees with fluorescence and thermodynamic data. HEV32 provides a simple molecular model for studying protein-carbohydrate interactions and for understanding the physiological relevance of small native hevein domains lacking C-terminal residues.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
