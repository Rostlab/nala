Well-ordered FcRn/Fc crystals are prevented by the formation of "oligomeric ribbons" of FcRn dimers bridged by Fc homodimers, thus we crystallized a 1:1 complex between rat FcRn and a heterodimeric Fc containing only one FcRn binding site. The 2.8 A complex structure demonstrates that FcRn uses its alpha2 and beta2-microglobulin domains and carbohydrate to interact with the Fc C(gamma)2-C(gamma)3 interface. The structure reveals conformational changes in Fc and three titratable salt bridges that confer pH-dependent binding, and can be used to guide rational design of therapeutic IgGs with longer serum half-lives.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
