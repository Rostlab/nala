The amino acid sequences of all the major components of the ocean pout antifreeze proteins, including the immunologically distinct QAE component, have been derived by Edman degradation. In addition, sequences of several minor components were deduced from DNA sequencing of cDNA and genomic clones. Fifty percent of the amino acids are perfectly conserved in all these proteins as well as in two homologous sequences from the distantly related wolffish. Several of the conserved residues are threonines and asparagines, amino acids that have been implicated in ice binding in the structurally unrelated antifreeze protein of the righteye flounders. Aside from minor differences in post-translational modifications, heterogeneity in antifreeze protein components stems from amino acid differences encoded by multiple genes. Based on genomic Southern blots and library cloning statistics there are 150 copies of the 0.7-kilobase-long antifreeze protein gene in the Newfoundland ocean pout, the majority of which are closely linked but irregularly spaced. A more southerly population of ocean pout from New Brunswick in which the circulating antifreeze protein levels are considerably lower has approximately one-quater as many antifreeze protein genes. Thus, there appears to be a correlation between gene dosage and antifreeze protein levels, and hence the ability to survive in ice-laden seawater. Southern blot comparison of the two populations indicates that the differences in gene dosage were not generated by a simple set of deletions/duplications. They are more likely to be the result of differential amplification.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
