These interactions were shown to contribute substantially to the stability of class I MHC/peptide complexes by thermal denaturation studies using synthetic peptides in which either the amino- or carboxyl-terminal group is substituted by a methyl group. Here we report crystal structures of HLA-A*0201 complexed with these terminally modified synthetic peptides showing that they adopt the same bound conformation as antigenic peptides. A number of variations in peptide conformation were observed for the terminally modified peptides, including in one case, a large conformational difference in four central peptide residues that is apparently caused by the lattice contact. This is reminiscent of the way binding a T-cell receptor changed the conformation of central residues of an MHC-bound peptide. The structures determined identify which conserved hydrogen bonds are eliminated in terminally substituted peptides and suggest an increased energetic importance of the interactions at the peptide termini for MHC-peptide stability.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
