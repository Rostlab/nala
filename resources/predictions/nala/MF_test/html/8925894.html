The peak intensities in the resultant 2D spectrum allow a direct classification of amide proton exchange rates according to short (ms), intermediate (ms to s) or long (&gt; or = s) residence times. This method was successfully used for the analysis of amide proton exchange rates in the 15N-labelled FruR DNA-binding domain and pertinent information about its dynamics was obtained.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
