The previously solved three-dimensional DtxR structures have identified two potential metal ion binding sites which may play a role in the activation of DNA binding by the repressor. We have used both X-ray crystallographic and site-directed mutational analysis of DtxR(C102D)-Ni2+ complexes and DtxR to identify the metal ion-binding site which results in the activation of the repressor. We demonstrate that DtxR contains both a primary and an ancillary metal ion binding site. The primary site functions directly in the activation of DNA binding. In contrast, the ancillary site contributes weakly, if at all, to activation.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
