Maspin inhibits tumor growth by blocking cell invasion, and its reactive center loop (RCL) is thought to mediate this activity. To understand this function on the molecular level, we have solved the three-dimensional structure of Maspin to 3.1 A resolution. The molecular structure shows the characteristic features of the serpin fold, but the RCL of Maspin is unique in length, composition, and placement. Although the RCL of Maspin is accessible and cleavable by some proteinases, it functions in the uncleaved, constrained conformation observed here. These structural results will contribute to our understanding of the mechanism by which Maspin suppresses tumors.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
