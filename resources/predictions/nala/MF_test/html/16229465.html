Archaeal RadA and Rad51 and eukaryal Rad51 and meiosis-specific DMC1 form a closely related group of recombinases distinct from bacterial RecA. Nevertheless, all such recombinases share a conserved core domain which carries the ATPase site and putative DNA-binding sites. Here we present the crystal structure of an archaeal RadA from Methanococcus voltae (MvRadA) in complex with ADP and Mg2+ at 2.1 A resolution. The crystallized RadA-ADP filament has an extended helical pitch similar to those of previously determined structures in the presence of nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue AMP-PNP. Structural comparison reveals two recurrent conformations with an extensive allosteric effect spanning the ATPase site and the putative DNA-binding L2 region. Varied conformations of the L2 region also imply a dynamic nature of recombinase-bound DNA.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
