Tyr1, Pro3, Pro6, and Ser5-PO4 side chains from each of two YSPTSPS repeats contribute to the interface. Comparison to the Pin1-CTD structure shows that the CTD can assume markedly different conformations that are templated by particular binding partners. Structural plasticity combined with remodeling of CTD primary structure by kinases and phosphatases provides a versatile mechanism by which the CTD can recruit structurally dissimilar proteins during transcription. A binding site for the RNA triphosphatase component of the capping apparatus was also uncovered within the Cgt1 OB domain.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
