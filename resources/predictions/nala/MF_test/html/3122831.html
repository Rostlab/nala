The active-site serine forms a covalent, nearly tetrahedral adduct with the boronic acid moiety of the inhibitor. The complex is stabilized by seven hydrogen bonds between the enzyme and inhibitor with additional stabilization arising from van der Waals interactions between enzyme and inhibitor side chains and the burying of 330 A2 of hydrophobic surface area. Hydrogen bonding between Asp-102 and His-57 remains intact in the enzyme-inhibitor complex, and His N epsilon 2 is well positioned to donate its hydrogen to the leaving group. Little change in the positions of protease residues was observed on complex formation (root mean square main chain deviation = 0.13 A), suggesting that in its native state the enzyme is complementary to tetrahedral reaction intermediates or to the nearly tetrahedral transition state for the reaction.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
