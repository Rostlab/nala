In solution, its conformational stability is also remarkably increased in the presence of divalent metal ions. Combining urea unfolding studies and X-ray crystallography, we compared the presence of several metal ions at specific sites in the protein to their contribution to the overall stabilizing effect in solution. We constructed thermodynamic cycles involving particular metal ions and specific carboxylate functions. The resulting coupling energies indicate that some (but not all) metal ions found at lattice contacts in crystal structures may indeed significantly contribute to stability enhancement in the presence of metal ions in solution.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
