Production of the C5' epimer of GDP-alpha-D-mannose, GDP-beta-L-gulose, has also been reported. The reaction occurs as part of vitamin C biosynthesis in plants. We have determined structures of complexes of GME with GDP-alpha-D-mannose, GDP-beta-L-galactose, and a mixture of GDP-beta-L-gulose with GDP-beta-L-4-keto-gulose to resolutions varying from 2.0 to 1.4 A. The enzyme has the classical extended short-chain dehydratase/reductase (SDR) fold. We have confirmed that GME establishes an equilibrium between two products, GDP-beta-L-galactose and GDP-beta-L-gulose. The reaction proceeds by C4' oxidation of GDP-alpha-D-mannose followed by epimerization of the C5' position to give GDP-beta-L-4-keto-gulose. This intermediate is either reduced to give GDP-beta-L-gulose or the C3' position is epimerized to give GDP-beta-L-4-keto-galactose, then C4' is reduced to GDP-beta-L-galactose. The combination of oxidation, epimerization, and reduction in a single active site is unusual. Structural analysis coupled to site-directed mutagenesis suggests C145 and K217 as the acid/base pair responsible for both epimerizations. On the basis of the structure of the GDP-beta-L-gulose/GDP-beta-L-4-keto-gulose co-complex, we predict that a ring flip occurs during the first epimerization and that a boat intermediate is likely for the second epimerization. Comparison of GME with other SDR enzymes known to abstract a protein alpha to the keto function of a carbohydrate identifies key common features.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
