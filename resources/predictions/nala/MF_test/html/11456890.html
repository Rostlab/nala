The protein contains paramagnetic copper(II), whose electronic relaxation times are quite unfavorable for NMR solution studies. The structure has been solved on the basis of 1041 meaningful NOESY cross-peaks, 18 1D NOEs, 26 T(1) values, 96 dihedral angle constraints, and 18 H-bonds. The detection of broad hyperfine-shifted signals and their full assignment allowed the identification of the copper(II) ligands and the determination of the Cu-S-C-H dihedral angle for the coordinated cysteine. The global root-mean-square deviation from the mean structure for the solution structure family is 0.72 +/- 0.14 and 1.16 +/- 0.17 A for backbone and heavy atoms, respectively. The structure is overall quite satisfactory and represents a breakthrough, in that it includes paramagnetic copper proteins among the metalloproteins for which solution structures can be afforded. The comparison with the available X-ray structure of a triple mutant is also performed.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
