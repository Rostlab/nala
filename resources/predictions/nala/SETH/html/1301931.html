The cDNA sequence of the human gene shows 85% identity with the bovine peripherin gene and the rds (retinal degeneration slow) genes from mouse and rat. Mutations in the RDS gene have recently been implicated in autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) in some families. Here we present evidence that the third exon of this gene is subject to polymorphic variation in humans. The three sequence alterations described in this paper give rise to amino acid substitutions. However, as these missense mutations also occur in the normal population they are not implicated as causing adRP. Interestingly such sequence variation is not found within other species examined including mouse and bovine. These intragenic polymorphisms will be of future potential value in studies to locate further disease causing mutations in adRP patients in the RDS gene.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
