We have examined 127 polymorphisms in three genomic regions in a sample of 575 chromosomes from unrelated individuals of British ancestry. To establish phase, 800 individuals were genotyped in 160 families. The fine structure of LD was found to be highly irregular. Forty-five percent of the variation in disequilibrium measures could be explained by physical distance. Additional factors, such as allele frequency, type of polymorphism, and genomic location, explained &lt;5% of the variation. Nevertheless, disequilibrium was occasionally detectable at 500 kb and was present for over one-half of marker pairs separated by &lt;50 kb. Although these findings are encouraging for the prospects of a genomewide LD map, they suggest caution in interpreting localization due to allelic association.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
