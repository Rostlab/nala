We examined the mutations of BCL10 gene in human primary liver cancer using non-isotopic PCR-SSCP. Three exons were examined in both cancer and non-HCC adjacent liver tissues. For each exon, six PCR products with abnormal bands were sequenced to verify those mutations. 56.5% samples were revealed a C to G mutation at position 5744 (g5744C&gt;G) of the first exon of BCL10 gene; 54.3% samples were revealed a T deletion mutation at position 11311 (g11311delT) of the second exon of BCL10 gene; 45.7% samples were revealed a C to T mutation at position 14116 (g14116C&gt;T) of the third exon of BCL10 gene. Similar mutation types were found in tumor-adjacent tissues at a lower frequency. The single base changes result in a truncated BCL10 protein expression. Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level, the tumor size had no significant relationship with BCL10 mutation.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
