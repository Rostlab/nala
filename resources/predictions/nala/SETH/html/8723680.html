We describe a novel missense mutation in exon 6 causing the substitution of Asp335 by Val. In transient transfections no enzyme activity could be expressed from the arylsulfatase A cDNA carrying this mutation. Examination of the effects of the mutation in cells stably overexpressing the mutant enzyme revealed, that the mutant enzyme is catalytically inactive and degraded in an early biosynthetic compartment. We have also investigated the effects of a previously identified mutation (T274M). The specific catalytic activity of the Met274 substituted arylsulfatase is reduced to about 35% of the normal enzyme when measured with an artificial substrate. Most of this enzyme is also degraded in an early biosynthetic compartment.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
