Syndromic and monogenic forms exist, and two loci have been identified. Infants present with vomiting due to gastric-outlet obstruction caused by hypertrophy of the smooth muscle of the pylorus. A genome-wide SNP-based high-density linkage scan was carried out on 81 IHPS pedigrees. Nonparametric and parametric linkage analysis identified loci on chromosomes 11q14-q22 (Z(max) = 3.9, p &lt; 0.0001; HLOD(max) = 3.4, alpha = 0.34) and Xq23 (Z(max) = 4.3, p &lt; 0.00001; HLOD(max) = 4.8, alpha = 0.56). The two linked chromosomal regions each harbor functional candidate genes that are members of the canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) family of ion channels and have a potential role in smooth-muscle control and hypertrophy.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
