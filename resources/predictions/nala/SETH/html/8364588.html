Type I collagen secretion was reduced and pro alpha 1(I) chains were overmodified. The mutation was localised in one COL1A1 allele by chemical cleavage of mismatched bases in normal cDNA/proband's mRNA heteroduplexes, and identified by cloning and sequencing. A G-to-A transition which causes the substitution of Gly-415 with serine in the alpha 1(I) triple helical domain was found. The same mutation was detected in the father's spermatozoa and lymphocytes. Mosaicism in the father's germline explains the occurrence in the family of two additional OI pregnancies, which were documented by X-ray and ultrasound investigations.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
