Mitochondrial changes are regularly present with ragged-red fibers showing deficiency of cytochrome c oxidase. In these muscle fiber segments, there is accumulation of mitochondria with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions. There are different deletions in different muscle fibers. In this study, we have sequenced for the first time the multiple mtDNA deletions in muscle from four patients with IBM. The deletion breakpoints were sequenced from cloned polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified mtDNA fragments. The sequencing was performed directly from the bacterial colonies used for cloning. Of 122 analyzed clones, 33 different deletions were identified. The majority of these have not previously been described. There was a marked predominance of deletion breakpoints in certain regions of mtDNA. These predominant breakpoint regions are similar to those described in other conditions with multiple deletions, such as autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia (adPEO) and normal aging, but different from those described in diseases due to single deletions such as Kearns-Sayre syndrome and sporadic PEO. These findings indicate that common factors are involved in the development of multiple mtDNA deletions in IBM, adPEO, and aging.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
