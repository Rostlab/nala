It is therefore of interest to determine both the relative frequency with which gain or loss can contribute to chromosomal mosaicism and whether these frequencies are influenced by selective factors. Thirty-two mosaic cases were examined with molecular markers, to try to determine which was the primary and which was the secondary cell line: 16 cases of disomy/trisomy mosaicism (5 trisomy 8, 2 trisomy 13, 1 trisomy 18, 4 trisomy 21, and 4 involving the X chromosome), 14 cases of 45,X/46,XX, and 2 cases of 45,X/47,XXX. Of the 14 cases of mosaic 45,X/46,XX, chromosome loss from a normal disomic fertilization predominated, supporting the hypothesis that 45,X might be compatible with survival only when the 45,X cell line arises relatively late in development. Most cases of disomy/trisomy mosaicism involving chromosomes 13, 18, 21, and X were also frequently associated with somatic loss of one (or more) chromosome, in these cases from a trisomic fertilization. By contrast, four of the five trisomy 8 cases were consistent with a somatic gain of a chromosome 8 during development from a normal zygote. It is possible that survival of trisomy 8 is also much more likely when the aneuploid cell line arises relatively late in development.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
