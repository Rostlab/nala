Since the description of the major mutation of this disease in 1989, over 150 of additional mutations have been identified in the CFTR gene. This update summarizes the different mutations identified and reported before March 15 by members of the international Cystic Fibrosis Genetic Analysis Consortium. The report includes information on DNA sequence variations found in the gene.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
