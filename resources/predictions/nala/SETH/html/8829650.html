To date, 17 mutations have been described including 11 missense, one nonsense, two mRNA splicing defects, one deletion and two coding region insertions. Most mutations have been identified in one or a few unrelated families with the exception of C73R and L4F which occurred in 29.6% and 9.3% of the 54 mutant alleles studied, respectively. Interestingly, analysis of the mutant alleles identified only 83% of the causative mutations, suggesting that about 20% of the mutations causing CEP lie elsewhere in the gene. Of note, mutation V82F, resulting from a G to T transversion of the last nucleotide of exon 4, caused both a missense mutation and an aberrantly spliced RNA transcript. Prokaryotic expression of the mutant URO-synthase alleles identified those with significant residual activity, thereby permitting genotype/phenotype predictions for this clinically heterogeneous disease.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
