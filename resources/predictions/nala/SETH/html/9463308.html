Control alleles and haplotypes were composed of parental marker alleles and haplotypes not transmitted to the affected child, in 90 simplex and 31 multiplex families from British Columbia. A total of 6,164 alleles at 11 loci were segregated through families of probands with RP MS or RR MS. The Vbeta8-Vbeta11 subhaplotype frequencies in the DRw15+ RP MS (but not RR MS) patients differed from control frequencies, because of an increase of the 2-1 subhaplotype (P=.02). Vbeta8-BamHI and Vbeta11-BamHI allele frequencies (P=.05 and .009, respectively) in the DRw15+ RP MS (but not RR MS) patients differed from control frequencies. The Vbeta1-Vbeta8 subhaplotype frequencies in the DRw15- RP MS (but not RR MS) patients differed from control frequencies (P=.03), with a significantly increased frequency of the 1-1 subhaplotype (P=.01; RR=7.1) in RP MS versus RR MS patients. Susceptibility to RP MS is associated both with a recessive inheritance of a gene linked to the 3' (Vbeta11) end of the 2-1 subhaplotype defined by the Vbeta8-BamHI and Vbeta11-BamHI alleles in DRw15+ patients and with a gene, located on the 1-1 subhaplotype, defined by the Vbeta1-TaqI and Vbeta8-MspI alleles of the TcR beta-chain complex in DRw15- patients.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
