We investigated whether these polymorphisms could be informative in the prediction of the presence of prostate cancer in men undergoing prostatic biopsy for the evaluation of an elevated serum-PSA level (&gt; or = 4.0 ng/ml). We genotyped 944 men who underwent a prostate biopsy at our institution, as well as a control population of 922 healthy, unselected women from the same population. The prevalence of the HPC2 Ala541Thr allele was similar in men with prostate cancer (6.3%), men with other prostatic conditions (6.8%), and healthy women (6.3%) (P = .83). We conclude that HPC2 genotyping is unlikely to be a useful adjunct to PSA in the prediction of the presence of biopsy-detected prostate cancer in asymptomatic men.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
