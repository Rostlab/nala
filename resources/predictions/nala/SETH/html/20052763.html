To establish experimentally the splicing pattern of these substitutions, whose impact on splicing is not always predictable by available softwares, ex vivo splicing assays were performed. The branch-point mapping strategy was also used to investigate further a putative branch-point mutation in USH2A intron 43. Aberrant splicing was demonstrated for 16 of the 21 (76.2%) tested sequence variations. The mutations resulted more frequently in activation of a nearby cryptic splice site or use of a de novo splice site than exon skipping (37.5%). This study allowed the reclassification as splicing mutations of one silent (c.7872G&gt;A (p.Glu2624Glu) in CDH23) and four missense mutations (c.2993G&gt;A (p.Arg998Lys) in USH2A, c.592G&gt;A (p.Ala198Thr), c.3503G&gt;C [p.Arg1168Pro], c.5944G&gt;A (p.Gly1982Arg) in MYO7A), whereas it provided clues about a role in structure/function in four other cases: c.802G&gt;A (p.Gly268Arg), c.653T&gt;A (p.Val218Glu) (USH2A), and c.397C&gt;T (p.His133Tyr), c.3502C&gt;T (p.Arg1168Trp) (MYO7A). Our data provide insights into the contribution of splicing mutations in Usher genes and illustrate the need to define accurately their splicing outcome for diagnostic purposes.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
