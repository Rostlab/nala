Cloning and sequencing of the junction fragments on 10p11 and 10q21 revealed that neither inversion breakpoint directly involved any genes or repetitive sequences, although both breakpoint regions contain a number of repeats. All 20 apparently unrelated inv(10) families in our study had identical breakpoints, and detailed haplotype analysis showed that the inversions were identical by descent. Thus, although considered a common variant, inv(10)(p11.2q21.2) has a single ancestral founder among northern Europeans.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
