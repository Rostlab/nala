Thirty-two regions of the COL2A1 gene were asymmetrically amplified with intron primers which were specifically chosen to amplify a region spanning 500 to 800 bp of sequence encoding one or more exons and their accompanying intervening sequences. Primers for dideoxynucleotide sequencing of the PCR products were then designed to provide complete exon sequence information and to insure that intron:exon splice junction sequence data would be obtained. Amplification and sequencing reactions were performed on an automated workstation to facilitate the handling of multiple DNA templates. The procedure allowed efficient sequencing of over 25,000 bp of each allele of the COL2A1 gene per diploid genome. We used this method for the comparative analyses of COL2A1 sequences in DNA isolated from the blood of 42 unrelated individuals and we identified 21 neutral sequence variants in the gene. The sequence variations were confirmed by independent assays, including restriction enzyme digestion. The sequence variants described here will be important for identifying haplotypes of the type II procollagen gene that will be useful in defining a genetic etiology for diseases of cartilaginous tissues.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
