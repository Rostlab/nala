Sequencing of the arylsulfatase A genes of a patient affected with late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy revealed that the patient is a compound heterozygote of two alleles carrying two deleterious mutation each. One allele bears a splice donor site mutation together with two polymorphisms and an additional missense mutation (Gly122 &gt; Ser). The splice donor site mutation and the Gly122 &gt; Ser substitution have been described recently but on different alleles. The other allele carries two missense mutations causing a Gly154 &gt; Asp and a Pro167 &gt; Arg substitution. When arylsulfatase A cDNAs carrying these mutations separately or in combination were transfected into baby hamster kidney cells expression of arylsulfatase A activity could not be detected. Linkage of mutations was verified by sequencing of the parental DNAs. Biosynthesis studies performed with the patients' fibroblasts show that the enzyme carrying both mutations is synthesized in almost normal amounts but is rapidly degraded in an early biosynthetic compartment. The occurence of two disease causing mutations on the same allele is a novel phenomenon in metachromatic leukodystrophy and as far as lysosomal storage diseases are concerned have so far only been described in Fabry disease and in the complex glucocerebrosidase alleles associated with Gaucher disease.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
