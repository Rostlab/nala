The disease was described for the first time as an X-linked muscular dystrophy, but autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms were reported. The genes for X-linked EMD and autosomal dominant EMD (AD-EMD) were identified. We report here that heterozygote mutations in LMNA, the gene for AD-EMD, may cause diverse phenotypes ranging from typical EMD to no phenotypic effect. Our results show that LMNA mutations are also responsible for the recessive form of the disease. Our results give further support to the notion that different genetic forms of EMD have a common pathophysiological background. The distribution of the mutations in AD-EMD patients (in the tail and in the 2A rod domain) suggests that unique interactions between lamin A/C and other nuclear components exist that have an important role in cardiac and skeletal muscle function.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
