In contrast, cells transfected without fragile-site induction showed an essentially random integration pattern. To determine whether the integration of marker DNA at fragile sites affects the frequency of fragile-site expression, the parental hybrid and three transfectants (two with pSV2neo integrated at the fragile site at 3p14.2 [FRA3B] and specific hamster fragile sites [chromosome 1, bands q26-31, or mar2, bands q11-13] and one with pSV2neo integrated at sites that are not fragile sites) were treated with aphidicolin. After 24 h the two cell lines with plasmid integration at FRA3B showed structural rearrangements at that site; these rearrangements accounted for 43%-67% of the total deletions and translocations observed. Structural rearrangements were not observed in the parental cell line. After 5 d aphidicolin treatment, the observed excess in frequency of structural rearrangements at FRA3B in the cell lines with pSV2neo integration at 3p14 over that in the two lines without FRA3B integration was less dramatic, but nonetheless significant. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of these cells, using a biotin-labeled pSV2neo probe, showed results consistent with the gross rearrangements detected cytogenetically in the lines with FRA3B integration; however, the pSV2neo sequences were frequently deleted concomitantly with translocations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</p></div></section></article></body></html>
