Quantification of cells carrying the NF1 mutation in different samples derived from the three embryonic layers revealed mosaicism. Furthermore, the construction of a minigene with patient's mutation (c.3198 - 314G&gt;A) confirmed its benign nature due to the leakiness of the splicing mechanism that generated a proportion of correctly spliced transcripts. Hence, we concluded that the mild phenotype observed in this patient is the result of the presence of mosaicism together with the benign nature of a leaky NF1-splice mutation. Finally, with the aim of developing a personalized therapeutic approach for this patient, we demonstrated correction of the splicing defect by using specific antisense morpholino oligomers. Our results provide an example of the molecular complexity behind disease phenotypes and highlight the importance of using comprehensive genetic approaches to better assess phenotype-genotype correlations.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
