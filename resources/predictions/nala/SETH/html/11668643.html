Seven novel mutations were identified (Q89X, G27R, G190D, R275Q, c.861insG, c.164insA, and IVS5+1G--&gt;A). Other previously described variants were a heterozygous deletion of a phenylalanine residue (F188del) in one allele and the R179X in two. The G27R mutation was carried by two patients. Analyses of ORNT1 mRNA in four patients showed that mutant alleles were stable and of the predicted size. The current study expands the spectrum of mutations in ORNT1 gene.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
