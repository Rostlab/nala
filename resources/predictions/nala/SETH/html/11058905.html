Six of them have not previously been described: E60X, P32R, 261delA, 934+2T--&gt;G, S443P, and 1593insC. The tissue samples were initially submitted to LOH analysis at 11q13 followed by SSCP screening of LOH-positive samples. Mutations were identified by direct sequencing and subcloning. Three (E60X, P32R, and 261delA) were in exon 2, one (934+2bp) in the splice junction of exon 5, one (S443P) in exon 9, and one (1593insC) in exon 10. The 3 mutations in exon 2 were associated with loss and/or creation of a restriction site. The corresponding germline sequence of the MEN1 gene was normal. Most mutations would likely result in a nonfunctional menin protein, and therefore in the loss of a tumor suppressor protein.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
