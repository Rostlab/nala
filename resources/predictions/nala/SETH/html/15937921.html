Few investigations have been devoted to the NPC2 protein, for which only 13 different disease-causing mutations (including three novel ones in this report) have been described. Among the currently known NPC2 mutant alleles, six resulted in a premature stop codon. Only five missense mutations, c.115G&gt;A (p.V39M), c.140G&gt;T (p.C47F), c.199T&gt;C (p.S67P), c.278G&gt;T (p.C93F), and (this report) c.295T&gt;C (p.C99R) were identified. In the present study, we generated cDNA constructs harboring each of these missense mutations and, upon overexpression in human fibroblasts with a nonsense NPC2 mutation, characterized the mutated proteins by immunoblotting, immunocytofluorescence microscopy, and complementation. Mutation p.V39M, described in the homozygous state in two patients with an adult-onset neurological disease, resulted in the synthesis of apparently functional recombinant proteins correctly targeted to lysosomes. Although a mild functional impact could possibly be overlooked in our overexpression system, comparative studies with NPC1 mutants indicated that mild mutations might not necessarily affect localization of the protein or its quantity in the native state. Conversely, mutations p.C47F, p.C93R, p.C99R but also, less predictably, p.S67P, led to the synthesis of misfolded recombinant proteins that colocalized with an endoplasmic reticulum marker. The four latter proteins were normally secreted but were unable to correct cholesterol storage in NPC2(-/-) cells. Functional characterization of the mutant proteins showed an excellent genotype-phenotype correlation in the three cases for whom a clinical history was available.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
