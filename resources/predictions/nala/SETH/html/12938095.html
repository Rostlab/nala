Here we report molecular studies in 22 unrelated Spanish patients with Fabry disease ( 20 males and two females). Fifteen novel mutations were identified. In addition 7 previously described mutations and two previously reported polymorphisms were detected. The 15 novel mutations comprise: eight missense E48K (c.142G&gt;A), W81S (c.242G&gt;C), D170H (c.508G&gt;C), W226C (c.678G&gt;T), Q279R (c.836A&gt;G), C382Y (c.1145G&gt;A), I407K (c.1220T&gt;A), L414S (c.1241T&gt;C); one nonsense W95X (c.284G&gt;A); one insertion Y216fsX15 (c.646_647insT); two small deletions G346fsX1 (c.1037delG), K426fsX23 (c.1277_1278delAA); one gross deletion comprising exons 5, 6, 7; one complex mutation (insertion and deletion) A368fsX24 (c.1102delGinsTTATAC), and one splice-site mutation IVS4+1G&gt;A (c.639+1G&gt;A). One of the females was found homozygous for Q279R mutation and she presented with the classic phenotype since the age of 8 years, this case extending into women the severe phenotype observed in classically affected males. Mutation analysis provided precise identification for 30 heterozygotes among female relatives and detection of a de novo mutation. The molecular studies on Spanish Fabry patients here reported further contribute to the identification of new mutations in this disease, and allow reliable detection of heterozygotes which has consequences for genetic counselling and for treatment.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
