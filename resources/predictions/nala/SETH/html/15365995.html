Identification of MMR gene mutations can have direct clinical implications in counseling and management of HNPCC families. We screened 44 HNPCC and 97 suspected HNPCC Korean families for germline mutations in three MMR genes: MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6. We identified twelve novel mutations: nine in MLH1(c.632_633insT, c.808_811delACTT, c.845C&gt;G, c.1625A&gt;C, c.1730+1delG, c.1907T&gt;C, c.1918C&gt;T, c.2104-2A&gt;G and c.2170T&gt;A), two in MSH2 (c.1886A&gt;G, c.1316_1318delCCT) and one in MSH6 (c.3488A&gt;T). In addition, two statically significant cSNPs in MLH1: c.1128T&gt;C ( p=0.008 in HNPCC and p=0.037 in early-onset CRC) and c.2168C&gt;A ( p&lt;0.001 in HNPCC). Interestingly, the most frequent mutation, c.1757_1758insC in MLH1, was a founder mutation inherited from a common Korean ancestor.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
