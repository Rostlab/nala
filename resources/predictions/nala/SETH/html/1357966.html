These mutations have included recombination events between Alu repeat units in the tyrosine kinase-encoding beta-chain region of the gene. To evaluate the influence of Alu and dinucleotide repetitive sequences on recombination events within the insulin receptor gene, I examined the degree of linkage disequilibrium between RFLP pairs spanning the gene. I established 228 independent haplotypes for seven RFLPs (two each for PstI, RsaI, and SstI and one for MspI and 172 independent haplotypes which included an additional RFLP with BglII) from 19 pedigrees. These RFLPs span &gt; 130 kb of this gene, and my colleagues and I previously demonstrated that multiple Alu sequences separate RFLP pairs. Observed haplotype frequencies deviated significantly from those predicted. Pairwise analysis of RFLP showed high levels of linkage disequilibrium among RFLP in the beta-chain region of the insulin receptor, but not between alpha-chain RFLPs and those of the beta-chain. Disequilibrium was present among beta-chain RFLPs, despite separation by one or more Alu repeat sequences. The very strong linkage disequilibrium which was present in sizable regions of the INSR gene despite the presence of both Alu and microsatellite repeats suggested that these regions do not have a major impact on recombinations at this locus.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
