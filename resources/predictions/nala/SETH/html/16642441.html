Most genetic studies have focused on an Alu insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in the ACE gene (DCP1) and have yielded conflicting results. We evaluated the association between 15 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DCP1, including the I/D variant, and AD in a sample of 92 patients with AD and 166 nondemented controls from an inbred Israeli Arab community. Although there was no evidence for association between AD and I/D, we observed significant association with SNPs rs4343 (P = .00001) and rs4351 (P = .01). Haplotype analysis revealed remarkably significant evidence of association with the SNP combination rs4343 and rs4351 (global P = 7.5 x 10(-7)). Individuals possessing the haplotype "GA" (frequency 0.21 in cases and 0.01 in controls) derived from these SNPs had a 45-fold increased risk of developing AD (95% CI 6.0-343.2) compared with those possessing any of the other three haplotypes. Longer range haplotypes including I/D were even more significant (lowest global P = 1.1 x 10(-12)), but the only consistently associated alleles were in rs4343 and rs4351. These results suggest that a variant in close proximity to rs4343 and rs4351 modulates susceptibility to AD in this community.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
