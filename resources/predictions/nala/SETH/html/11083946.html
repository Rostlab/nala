A 28-kb deletion spanning the D15S63 locus was identified in five unrelated patients; in each of them the deletion was inherited from a normal parent. Three of the five families segregating the deletion were reported to be of Jewish Ashkenazi ancestry, and in the other two families the ancestral origin was unknown. To determine whether the 28-kb deletion is a benign variant, we screened for the deletion in 137 unselected Ashkenazi individuals and in 268 patients who were referred for molecular diagnosis of PWS/AS, of whom 89 were Ashkenazi and 47 were of mixed origin (Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi Jews). In the control group, three individuals were carriers of the deletion; among the patients, three were carriers, all of whom were Ashkenazi Jews. There was no significant difference between the control group and the Ashkenazi patients, indicating that the deletion is not a cause of PWS- and AS-like syndromes. The frequency of the 28-kb deletion in the Ashkenazi population was 1/75. Since methylation analysis at the D15S63 locus may lead to misdiagnosis, we suggest the use of SNRPN, either in a PCR-based assay or as a probe in Southern hybridization, as the method of choice in the diagnosis of PWS/AS.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
