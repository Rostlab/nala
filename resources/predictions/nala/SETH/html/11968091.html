About 70% of HHL is non-syndromic, with autosomal recessive forms accounting for approximately 85% of the genetic load. Although very heterogeneous, the most common cause of HHL in many different world populations is mutations of GJB2, a gene that encodes the gap junction protein connexin 26 (Cx26). This study investigates the contribution of GJB2 to the autosomal recessive non-syndromic deafness (ARNSD) load in the Iranian population. One hundred sixty eight persons from 83 families were studied. GJB2-related deafness was diagnosed in 9 families (4, 35delG homozygotes; 3, 35delG compound heterozygotes; 1, W24X homozygote; 1, non-35delG compound heterozygote). The carrier frequency of the 35delG allele in this population was approximately 1% (1/83). Because the relative frequency of Cx26 mutations is much less than in the other populations, it is possible that mutations in other genes play a major role in ARNSD in Iran.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
