This data has been published by seven different laboratories in Europe, the United States, Australia, and Japan. Mutations have been demonstrated in 60-75% of patients with a clinically confirmed diagnosis of Alagille syndrome. Total gene deletions have been reported in 3-7% of patients, and the remainder have intragenic mutations. Seventy two percent (168/233) of the reported mutations lead to frameshifts that cause a premature termination codon. These mutations will either lead to a prematurely truncated protein, or alternatively, nonsense mediated decay might lead to lack of a product from that allele. Twenty three unique missense mutations were identified (13% of mutations). These were clustered in conserved regions at the 5' end of the gene, or in the EGF repeats. Splicing consensus sequence changes were identified in 15% of patients. A high frequency of de novo mutations (60-70%) has been reported. The spectrum of mutations identified is consistent with haploinsufficiency for JAG1 being a mechanism for Alagille syndrome.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
