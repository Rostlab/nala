Hydrolethalus syndrome was described in 1981 in Finland, where the incidence is 1:20,000. Only a few cases have been reported elsewhere, and the pathogenesis has remained unknown. Here we report the assignment of the hydrolethalus syndrome locus to chromosome 11q23-25 in Finnish families. The initial genome scan was performed using DNA samples from only 15 affected individuals. In the next step, the hydrolethalus syndrome locus was assigned to an 8.5-cM interval between markers D11S4144 and D11S1351 by linkage analysis in eight families. Finally, the critical locus could be restricted by linkage disequilibrium and haplotype analyses to a 0.5-1-cM region between markers D11S933 and D11S934. Genealogical studies performed in 40 families affected by hydrolethalus revealed no regional clustering, suggesting a relatively early introduction of the disease mutation into the Finnish population and the spreading of the mutation with the inhabitation of the late-settlement area.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
