This modified protocol for heteroduplex detection by hydrolink gel electrophoresis detected all 12 of these mutations and was utilised to rapidly determine the carrier status of females from affected families. On the basis of these results this approach appears to be a rapid and reliable screening method for point mutations in addition to small length mutations and for carrier detection in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
