We recently reported positive association of synapsin II with schizophrenia in a case-control study (Chen et al. 2004). However, since case-control analyses can generate false-positive results in the presence of minor degrees of population stratification, we have performed a replication study in 366 additional Han Chinese probands and their parents by use of analyses of transmission/disequilibrium for three in/del markers and three single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Positive association was observed for rs2307981 (P =.02), rs2308169 (P =.005), rs308963 (P =.002), rs795009 (P =.02), and rs2307973 (P =.02). For transmission of six-marker haplotypes, the global P value was.0000016 (5 degrees of freedom), principally because of overtransmission of the most common haplotype, CAA/-/G/T/C/- (frequency 53.6%; chi (2) = 20.8; P =.0000051). This confirms our previous study and provides further support for the role of synapsin II variants in susceptibility to schizophrenia.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
