Numerous mutations of the gene encoding alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA) are known in Hurler syndrome, but only three in the other disorders. We report on novel mutations of the IDUA gene in one patient with the Scheie syndrome and in three patients with the Hurler/Scheie syndrome. The novel mutations, all single base changes, encoded the substitutions R492P (Scheie), and X654G, P496L, and L490P (Hurler/Scheie). The L490P mutation was apparently homozygous, whereas each of the others was found in compound heterozygosity with a Hurler mutation. The deleterious nature of the mutations was confirmed by absence of enzyme activity upon transfection of the corresponding mutagenized cDNAs into Cos-1 cells. These results provide additional information for genotype-phenotype correlations.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
