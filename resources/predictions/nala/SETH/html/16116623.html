However, the suitability of such systems for the examination of DNA derived from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues has not been tested. Therefore, we analyzed DNA derived from five matching fresh frozen and FFPE ovarian tumors for gene copy number changes and loss of heterozygosity using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 10 K Array Xba 131. The data was analyzed using Affymetrix proprietary software, GeneChip DNA Analysis Software, and Chromosome Copy Number Tool. The average SNP call rate (rate of successful genotype identification) of the fresh samples was 89.44% (range 78.72-96.22%, median 92.72%) and was only slightly lower for the matching FFPE samples at 83.48% (range 76.93-93.17%, median 82.60%). The average concordance (rate of agreement between successful genotype calls) between the fresh and matching FFPE samples was 97.06% (range 92.70-99.41%, median 97.52%). Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) profiles of the fresh and FFPE samples were essentially identical across all chromosomes. Copy number data was also comparable, although the quantification of copy number changes appears overstated in the FFPE samples. In conclusion, we have shown that it is possible to achieve high-performance outcomes using FFPE-derived DNA in the Affymetrix 10 K mapping array. This advance will open up vast archival tissue resources to high-resolution genetic analysis and unlock a wealth of biological information.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
