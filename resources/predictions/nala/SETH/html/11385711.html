This residue coincides with the -2 position of the exon 5 donor splice site. We further investigated the effect of this base substitution on the splicing of BRCA1 mRNA. The sequence analysis of the cDNA indicated that 22 bp of exon 5 were deleted, creating with the first bases of exon 6 a termination codon at position 64, which results in a truncated protein. The BRCA1 haplotype of the R71G carrier patients and Spanish controls was analysed by use of six microsatellites located within or near BRCA1. Our results are consistent with the possibility that these families shared a common ancestry with BRCA1 R71G being a founder mutation of Spanish origin.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
