Some families have had affected members with involvement of the kidneys, variously reported as Wilms tumors, nephroblastomas, and hamartomas. The HPT-JT gene (HRPT2) maps to chromosome 1q25-q31. We describe further investigation of two HPT-JT families (K3304 and K3349) identified through the literature. These two expanded families and two previously reported families were investigated jointly for linkage with 21 new, closely linked markers. Multipoint linkage analysis resulted in a maximum LOD score of 7.83 (at recombination fraction 0) for markers D1S2848-D1S191. Recombination events in these families reduced the HRPT2 region to approximately 14.7 cM. In addition, two of these four study families (i.e., K3304 and K11687) share a 2.2-cM length of their (expanded) affected haplotype, indicating a possible common origin. Combining the linkage data and shared-haplotype data, we propose a 0.7-cM candidate region for HRPT2.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
