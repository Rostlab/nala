Both purported parents were tested, and neither carries the gene deletion. Polymorphic simple-sequence repeat analyses at 15 loci on chromosome 1 and at 16 loci on other chromosomes confirmed parentage and revealed that a de novo mutation prior to maternal meiosis I, followed by nondisjunction in maternal meiosis II, resulted in an oocyte with two copies of the de novo mutant allele. Fertilization by a sperm that did not carry a paternal chromosome 1 or subsequent mitotic loss of the paternal chromosome 1 resulted in the propositus inheriting two mutant MSUD2 alleles on two maternal number 1 chromosomes.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
