We found LOD scores &gt;6 with markers on chromosome 11q. Analysis of key recombinants maps this deafness gene (DFNA12) to a 36-cM interval on chromosome 11q22-24, between markers D11S4120 and D11S912. The critical regions for the recessive deafness locus DFNB2 and the dominant locus DFNA11, which were previously localized to the long arm of chromosome 11, do not overlap with the candidate interval of DFNA12.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
