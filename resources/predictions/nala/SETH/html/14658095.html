Clinical studies, reinforced by epidemiology and genetics, show impressive variation in disease severity, expression, prevalence, and incidence by ethnicity and sex. To identify the novel SLE susceptibility loci, we performed a genomewide scan with 318 markers on 37 multiplex Hispanic families, using a nonparametric penetrance-independent affected-only allele-sharing method. Three chromosomal regions (12q24, 16p13, and 16q12-21) exceeded our predetermined threshold (Zlr&gt;2.32; nominal P&lt;.01) for further evaluation. Suspected linkages at 12q24, 16p13, and 16q12-21 were tested in an independent data set consisting of 92 European American (EA-1) and 55 African American (AA) families. The linkage at 12q24 was replicated in EA-1 (Zlr=3.06; P=.001) but not in AA (Zlr=0.37; P=.35). Although neither the 16p13 nor the 16q12-21 was confirmed in EA-1 or AA, the suggestive linkage (Zlr=3.06; P=.001) at 16q12-21 is sufficient to confirm the significant linkage, reported elsewhere, at this location. The evidence for linkage at 12q24 in the 129 combined (Hispanic and EA-1) families exceeded the threshold for genomewide significance (Zlr=4.39; P=5.7x10-6; nonparametric LOD=4.19). Parametric linkage analyses suggested a low-penetrance, dominant model (LOD=3.72). To confirm the linkage effect at 12q24, we performed linkage analysis in another set of 82 independent European American families (EA-2). The evidence for linkage was confirmed (Zlr=2.11; P=.017). Therefore, our results have detected, established, and confirmed the existence of a novel SLE susceptibility locus at 12q24 (designated "SLEB4") that may cause lupus, especially in Hispanic and European American families.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
