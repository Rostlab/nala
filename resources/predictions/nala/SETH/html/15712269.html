Protein residues G801 and H200 are conserved among the four mammalian alpha-mannosidases cloned to date: human, cattle, cat and mouse. In vitro expression studies demonstrated that both missense mutations expressed no residual alpha-mannosidase activity indicating that they are disease-causing mutations. Modelling into the three-dimensional structure revealed that the p.H200L could involve the catalytic mechanism, whereas p.G801D would affect the correct folding of the enzyme.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
