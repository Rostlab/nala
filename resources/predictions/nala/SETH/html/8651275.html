Two mutant GAMT alleles were identified that carried a single base substitution within a 5' splice site or a 13-nt insertion and gave rise to four mutant transcripts. Three of the transcripts encode truncated polypeptides that lack a residue known to be critical for catalytic activity of GAMT. Deficiency of GAMT is the first inborn error of creatine metabolism. It causes a severe developmental delay and extrapyramidal symptoms in early infancy and is treatable by oral substitution with creatine.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
