Linkage of the disease gene to an approximately 7.8-cM region between markers D9S1867 and D9S1790 at 9q21.3-22 was identified by homozygosity mapping in four inbred FHL families of Pakistani descent with a combined maximum multipoint LOD score of 6.05. This is the first genetic locus to be described in FHL. However, homozygosity by descent across this interval could not be demonstrated in an additional affected kindred of Arab origin, whose maximum multipoint LOD score was -0.12. The combined sample revealed significant evidence for linkage to 9q markers (LOD score with heterogeneity, 5.00). Identification of the gene(s) involved in the pathogenesis of FHL will contribute to an understanding of the control of T-lymphocyte and macrophage activation, which is central to homeostasis in the immune system.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
