The Tourette Syndrome Association International Consortium for Genetics.</p><p id="abstract">Gilles de la Tourette syndrome is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by waxing and waning multiple motor and phonic tics with a complex mode of inheritance. Previous attempts, which used large multigenerational families to localize susceptibility loci, have been unsuccessful. In this report, the results of the first systematic genome scan, using 76 affected-sib-pair families with a total of 110 sib pairs, are summarized. While no results reached acceptable statistical significance, the multipoint maximum-likelihood scores (MLS) for two regions (4q and 8p) were suggestive (MLS &gt; 2.0). Four additional genomic regions also gave multipoint MLS scores between 1.0 and 2.0.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
