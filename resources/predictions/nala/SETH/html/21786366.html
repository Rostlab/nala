Affected sibs were compound heterozygotes for a missense MRPL3 mutation (P317R) and a large-scale deletion, inherited from the mother and the father, respectively. These mutations were shown to alter ribosome assembly and cause a mitochondrial translation deficiency in cultured skin fibroblasts resulting in an abnormal assembly of several complexes of the respiratory chain. This observation gives support to the view that exome sequencing combined with genetic mapping is a powerful approach for the identification of new genes of mitochondrial disorders.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
