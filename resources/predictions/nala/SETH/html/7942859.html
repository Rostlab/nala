Phenotypic selection of sib pairs, which is known to yield striking increases in power when a single marker is used, provides further increases in power when the interval-mapping approach is used. The greatest benefits of the combined approach are apparent with coarse maps, where QTLs of relatively modest (15%-20%) heritability can be detected with widely spaced markers (40-60 cM apart) in reasonably sized sibling samples. Useful information concerning QTL location is afforded by interval mapping in both selected and unselected samples.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
