It included single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of all functional regions of the gene and further sequencing of all fragments showing abnormal migration. In 76 patients (90.4%), it was possible to identify molecular alterations leading to the appearance of the disease. Twenty-one new mutations were identified, including 13 missense mutations, two nonsense mutations, three splice-site mutations, one frameshift deletion, one frameshift insertion, and one non-frameshift deletion. The approach appears to be very suitable for molecular diagnosis of hemophilia B.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
