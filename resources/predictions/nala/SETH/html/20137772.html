We present the identification of an inactivating mutation in the ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) gene causing autosomal-recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (ARHR) with phosphaturia by positional cloning. ENPP1 generates inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), an essential physiologic inhibitor of calcification, and previously described inactivating mutations in this gene were shown to cause aberrant ectopic calcification disorders, whereas no aberrant calcifications were present in our patients. Our surprising result suggests a different pathway involved in the generation of ARHR and possible additional functions for ENPP1.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
