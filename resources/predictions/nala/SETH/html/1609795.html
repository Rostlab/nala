In view of the altered expression of AChE in some central neurological and neuromuscular disorders with a probable genetic basis, we have identified the chromosomal location of the gene encoding AChE. Chromosomal in situ suppression hybridization analysis revealed a single gene to be at 7q22, a result which was confirmed by PCR analysis of genomic DNA from a human/hamster somatic cell hybrid containing a single human chromosome 7. The AChE gene thus maps to the same region in which frequent nonrandom chromosome 7 deletions occur in leukemias of myeloid cell precursors known to express the enzyme during normal differentiation.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
