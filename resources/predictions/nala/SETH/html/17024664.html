VHL disease displays marked variation in expression and the presence of pheochromocytoma has been linked to missense VHL mutations. We analyzed genotype-phenotype correlations in 573 individuals with VHL disease. Routine clinical and radiological surveillance of VHL patients and at-risk relatives was associated with increased detection of retinal angiomatosis (73 vs. 59% of cases) and a reduction in age at diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (44.0+/-10.9 vs. 39.7+/-10.3 years). We confirmed the association of pheochromocytoma with missense mutations described previously, but stratifying missense mutations into those that resulted in substitution of a surface amino acid and those that disrupted structural integrity demonstrated that surface amino acid substitutions conferred a higher pheochromocytoma risk. Age at first manifestation of VHL disease was significantly earlier (P=0.001), and age-related risks of retinal angiomas and RCC were higher (P=0.022 and P=0.0008, respectively) in individuals with a nonsense or frameshift mutation than in those with deletions or missense mutations that disrupted the structural integrity of the VHL gene product (pVHL). These results extend genotype-phenotype-protein structure correlations in VHL disease and provide a baseline for future chemoprevention studies in VHL disease.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
