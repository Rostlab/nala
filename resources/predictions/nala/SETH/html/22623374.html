More than 280 mutations in the GBA gene have been directly associated with GD. Mutant GCase variants present variable levels of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention, due to their inability to correctly fold, and undergo ER-associated degradation (ERAD) in the proteasomes. The degree of ER retention and proteasomal degradation is one of the factors that determine GD severity. In the present review, we discuss ERAD of mutant GCase variants and its possible consequences in GD patients and in carriers of GD mutations.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
