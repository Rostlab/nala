However, this problem of population stratification can be circumvented in a quite elegant manner by family-based methods. The haplotype-relative-risk (HRR) method, which samples nuclear families with a single affected child and uses the parental haplotypes not transmitted to that child as a control individual, represents such a method for estimating the relative risk of a marker phenotype. In the special case of a recessive disease, it was already known that the equivalence of the HRR method with the classical relative risk (RR) obtained from independent samples holds only if the probability theta of a recombination between marker and disease locus is zero. We extend this result to an arbitrary mode of inheritance. Furthermore, we compare the distribution of the estimators for HRR and RR and show that, in the case of a positive linkage disequilibrium between a marker and disease allele, the distribution of the estimator for HRR is (stochastically) smaller than that for RR, irrespective of the recombination fraction. The practical implication of this result is that, for the HRR method, there is no tendency to give unduly high risk estimators, even for theta &gt; 0. Finally, we give an expression for the standard error of the estimator for HRR by taking into account the nonindependence of transmitted and nontransmitted parental marker alleles in the case of theta &gt; 0.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
