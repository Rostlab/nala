The disease is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. We have identified an 84-bp deletion in exon 13 of the CFTR gene, detected by DNA amplification and direct sequencing of 500 bp of the 5' end of exon 13. The deletion was in the maternal allele of a CF patient bearing the delta F508 deletion in the father's allele. The same 84-bp deletion could also be detected in the patient's mother. The deletion spanned from a four-A cluster in positions 1949-1952 to another four-A cluster in positions 2032-2035, including 84 bp which correspond to codons 607-634 (1949del84). The reported mutation would result in the loss of 28 amino acid residues of the R domain of the CFTR protein.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
