Segregation analysis was performed using the REGTL program of S.A.G.E. The results showed that Mendelian autosomal recessive inheritance of a major gene that influences susceptibility to esophageal cancer provided the best fit to the data. In the best-fitting recessive model, the frequency of the disease allele was.2039. There was a significant sex effect on susceptibility to the disease. The maximum cumulative probability of esophageal cancer among males with the AA genotype was 100%, but, among females, it was 63.5%. The mean age at onset for both men and women was 62 years. The age-dependent penetrances for males with the AA genotype by the ages of 60 and 80 years were 41.6% and 95.2%, respectively, whereas, for females, they were 26.4% and 60.5%, respectively. Incorporating environmental risk factors-such as cigarette smoking, pipe smoking, alcohol drinking, eating hot food, and eating pickled vegetables-into the models did not provide significant improvement of the fit of the models to these data. The results suggest a major locus underlying susceptibility to esophageal cancer with sex-specific penetrance.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
