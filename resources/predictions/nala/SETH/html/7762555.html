The first mutation is a G-to-A transition at base 374 in exon 3, causing an arginine-to-glutamic acid substitution at position 125 of the protein (R125Q). This mutation has been found in homozygosity in a patient partially responsive to pyridoxine treatment. The second mutation is a C-to-T transition at base 770 in exon 7, causing a threonine-to-methionine substitution at amino acid 257 of the protein (T257M). This mutation has been observed in homozygosity in a patient nonresponsive to the cofactor treatment. The third mutation, found in heterozygosity in a patient responsive to pyridoxine treatment, is an insertion of 68 bp in exon 8 at base 844, which introduces a premature termination codon. The fourth mutation is C-to-T transition in exon 2 at base 262, causing a proline-to-serine substitution at position 88 of the protein (P88S). This mutation is carried on a single allele in three affected sisters responsive to the cofactor treatment. In addition, six previously reported mutations (A114V, E131D, P145L, I278T, G307S, and A1224-2C) have been tested in 14 independent Italian families. Mutations A114V and I278T are carried by three and by seven independent alleles, respectively. The other four mutations--including G307S and A1224-2C, common among northern European patients--have not been detected.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
