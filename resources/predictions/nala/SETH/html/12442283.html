In our ongoing glaucoma study six hundred eighty two persons have been screened for MYOC mutations. The first group consisted of 453 patients from a long-term clinical study diagnosed either with juvenile OAG (JOAG), POAG, ocular hypertension (OHT) or normal tension glaucoma (NTG) plus 22 cases of secondary glaucoma. This group, and additional 83 healthy controls, is part of a long term study with repeated clinical examinations at the University of Erlangen-Nurnberg. An additional sample of 124 glaucoma patients or at risk persons referred from other sources were included in the mutation screening. Five novel mutations, namely Gly434Ser, Asn450Asp, Val251Ala, Ile345Met and Ser393Asn, could be identified as cause of preperimetric POAG, JOAG, normal tension POAG and POAG. Myocilin mutations were identified similar with previous reports with other ethnic populations at the rate of 11/341 (3.2%) probands.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
