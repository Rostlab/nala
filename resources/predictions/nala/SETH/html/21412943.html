The purpose of our study was to establish the prevalence and nature of C2orf71 mutations in a clinically well-characterized cohort of 345 sporadic and arRP French cases. Direct sequencing of C2orf71 was performed in 209 subjects for whom mutations had previously been excluded by microarray technology and direct sequencing of EYS. Putative pathogenicity of the identified variants was evaluated through co-segregation analysis, screening of more than 188 control chromosomes and prediction programs. We identified two patients compound heterozygous for mutations predicted to lead to a premature stop codon, 3 of which are novel. In addition, 3 patients carried a single variant of likely pathogenicity. Furthermore a large number of novel putative non-disease causing variants were identified, highlighting the extremely polymorphic nature of C2orf71. To our knowledge, our study provides the first large scale screening of C2orf71 in a French arRP cohort through direct sequencing and suggests that it would account for approximately 1% of arRP cases.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
