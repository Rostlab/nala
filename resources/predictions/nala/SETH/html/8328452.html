Four alleles were identified, using a combination of (a) PCR amplification of reverse-transcribed RNA or genomic DNA segments, (b) cycle sequencing of PCR products, and (c) restriction-enzyme analysis. One allele has two amino acid substitutions, Gly409--&gt;Arg in exon 9 and Ter--&gt;Cys in exon 14. The other three alleles have mutations in exon 2 (Tyr64--&gt;Ter), exon 7 (Gln310--&gt;Ter), or exon 8 (Thr366--&gt;Pro). Transfection of mutagenized cDNAs into Cos-1 cells showed that two missense mutations, Thr366--&gt;Pro and Ter--&gt;Cys, permitted the expression of only trace amounts of alpha-L-iduronidase activity, whereas Gly409--&gt;Arg permitted the expression of 60% as much enzyme as did the normal cDNA. The nonsense mutations were associated with abnormalities of RNA processing: (1) both a very low level of mRNA and skipping of exon 2 for Tyr64--&gt;Ter and (2) utilization of a cryptic splice site for Gln310--&gt;Ter. In all instances, the probands were found homozygous, and the parents heterozygous, for the mutant alleles, as anticipated from the consanguinity in each family. The two-mutation allele was identified in a family from Gaza; the other three alleles were found in seven families, five of them Druze, residing in a very small area of northern Israel. Since such clustering suggests a classic founder effect, the presence of three mutant alleles of the IDUA gene was unexpected.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
