We studied six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CHRNA4 gene and four SNPs in the CHRNB2 gene with respect to nicotine dependence in a collection of 901 subjects (815 siblings and 86 parents) from 222 nuclear families with multiple nicotine-addicted siblings. The subjects were assessed for addiction by both the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) and the Revised Tolerance Questionnaire (RTQ). Because only 5.8% of female offspring were smokers, only male subjects were included in the final analyses (621 men from 206 families). Univariate (single-marker) family-based association tests (FBATs) demonstrated that variant alleles at two SNPs, rs1044396 and rs1044397, in exon 5 of the CHRNA4 gene were significantly associated with a protective effect against nicotine addiction as either a dichotomized trait or a quantitative phenotype (i.e., age-adjusted FTND and RTQ scores), which was consistent with the results of the global haplotype FBAT. Furthermore, the haplotype-specific FBAT showed a common (22.5%) CHRNA4 haplotype, GCTATA, which was significantly associated with both a protective effect against nicotine addiction as a dichotomized trait (Z=-3.04, P&lt;.005) and significant decreases of age-adjusted FTND (Z=-3.31, P&lt;.005) or RTQ scores (Z=-2.73, P=.006). Our findings provide strong evidence suggesting a common CHRNA4 haplotype might be protective against vulnerability to nicotine addiction in men.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
