This method allows genotyping of the template DNA, through differential labeling of the allele-specific competitive oligoprimers and biotinylation of the common reverse primer. The system provides a basis for rapid, simple, and reliable detection of the numerous known beta-thalassemia mutations, revealing the precise nature of the mismatch in each case, and thereby facilitating the molecular genetic analysis of the disease.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
