The RECQL4 gene structure is unusual because it contains many small introns &lt;100 bp. We describe a proband with RTS who has a novel 11-bp intronic deletion, and we show that this mutation results in a 66-bp intron too small for proper splicing. Constraint on intron size may represent a general mutational mechanism, since human-genome analysis reveals that approximately 15% of genes have introns &lt;100 bp and are therefore susceptible to size constraint. Thus, monitoring of intron size may allow detection of mutations missed by exon-by-exon approaches.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
