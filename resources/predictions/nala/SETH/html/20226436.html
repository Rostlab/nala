Using a collection of 5862 cases with VT and 7112 healthy controls, we identified the HIVEP1 locus on chromosome 6p24.1 as a susceptibility locus for VT. Indeed, the HIVEP1 rs169713C allele was associated with an increased risk for VT, with an odds ratio of 1.20 (95% confidence interval 1.13-1.27, p = 2.86 x 10(-9)). HIVEP1 codes for a protein that participates in the transcriptional regulation of inflammatory target genes by binding specific DNA sequences in their promoter and enhancer regions. The current results provide the identification of a locus involved in VT susceptibility that lies outside the traditional coagulation/fibrinolysis pathway.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
