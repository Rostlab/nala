Microsatellite instability has been demonstrated in hereditary and sporadic colorectal carcinomas and is usually observed in noncoding regions of genomic DNA. However, relatively few coding region targets of MI have been identified thus far. Using PCR, we amplified regions encompassing (A)8 and (C)8 microsatellite tracts within hMSH3 and hMSH6 from 31 RER+ sporadic colorectal tumors, 8 hereditary colon cancers, 23 RER+ gastric carcinomas, and 32 RER- gastric tumors. Mutations were found in 11 (36%) of 31 sporadic colon carcinomas, 4 (50%) of 8 hereditary colorectal cancers, and 5 (22%) of 23 RER+ gastric carcinomas, but in only 2 (6%) of 32 RER- gastric carcinomas. These frameshift mutations cause premature stop codons downstream that are predicted to abolish normal protein function. Our results and those of others suggest that DNA mismatch repair genes, such as hMSH3 and hMSH6, are targets for the mutagenic activity of upstream mismatch repair gene mutations and that this enhanced genomic instability may accelerate the accumulation of mutations in RER+ tumors.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
