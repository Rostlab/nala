nala.learning belongs to the machine learning part and provides CRFsuite interfaces as well as evaluation and post-processing.
Additionally the abstract class Tagger is defined, which can implement mutation mention recognisers as well as any other prediction method.
Consequently the nala framework is not bound to CRFsuite, which we currently use.
